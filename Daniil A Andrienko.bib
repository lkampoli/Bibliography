 abstract = {A master equation study of vibrational relaxation and dissociation of oxygen is conducted using state-specific O2–O transition rates, generated by extensive trajectory simulations. Both O2–O and O2–O2 collisions are concurrently simulated in the evolving nonequilibrium gas system under constant heat bath conditions. The forced harmonic oscillator model is incorporated to simulate the state-to-state relaxation of oxygen in O2–O2 collisions. The system of master equations is solved to simulate heating and cooling flows. The present study demonstrates the importance of atom-diatom collisions due to the extremely efficient energy randomization in the intermediate O3 complex. It is shown that the presence of atomic oxygen has a significant impact on vibrational relaxation time at temperatures observed in hypersonic flow. The population of highly-excited O2 vibrational states is affected by the amount of atomic oxygen when modeling the relaxation under constant heat bath conditions. A model of coupled state-to-state vibrational relaxation and dissociation of oxygen is also discussed.},

 abstract = {O2–O collisions are studied by the quasi-classical trajectory method. A full set of cross sections for the vibrational ladder is obtained utilizing an accurate O3 potential energy surface. Vibrational relaxation is investigated at temperatures between 1000 and 10,000K, that are relevant to hypersonic flows. The relaxation time is derived based on the removal rate for the first excited vibrational level. A significant deviation from the formula by Millikan and White is observed for temperatures beyond those reported in experimental work. Relaxation becomes less efficient at high temperatures, suggesting that the efficiency of the energy randomization is strongly to the attractive component of the O3 potential energy surface. These results are explained by analyzing the microscopic parameter of collisions that reflects the number of exchanges in the shortest interatomic distance. The rates of exothermic transitions are found to be nearly independent of the translational temperature in the range of interest.},

A system of master equations describes the relaxation of the rovibrational ensemble to thermal equilibrium under ideal heat bath conditions at a constant translational temperature. Vibrational and rotational relaxation times, obtained from the average internal energies, exhibit a pattern inherent in a chemically reactive collisional pair. An intrinsic feature of the O3 molecular system with a large attractive potential is a weak temperature dependence of the rovibrational transition rates. For this reason, the quasi-steady vibrational and rotational temperatures experience a maximum at increasing translational temperature. The energy rate coefficients, that characterize the average loss of internal energy due to dissociation, quickly diminish at high temperatures, compared to other molecular systems.},

 abstract = {Transition rates in O2–O collisions for each vibrational and rovibrational state are generated by means of the quasi-classical trajectory method using potential energy surfaces of different fidelities. The first potential energy surface, obtained via the double many-body expansion method, is adopted to obtain vibrational transition rates assuming transrotational equilibrium. The trajectory simulation on a simpler potential surface, based on the two-body pairwise interaction, generates a complete set of rates for each internal state. Vibrational and rotational relaxations of oxygen in a heat bath of parent atoms are modeled by a system of master equations at translational temperatures between 1000 and 20,000 K. It is shown that the vibrational relaxation becomes less efficient at high temperatures, in contrast with the conventional equation for relaxation time proposed by Millikan and White (“Systematics of Vibrational Relaxation,” Journal of Chemical Physics, Vol. 39, No. 12, 1963, Paper 3209). Rotational and vibrational relaxation times are the same order of magnitude in the range of temperatures observed in hypersonic flows. The excitation of the vibrational mode in O2–O collisions under typical postshock conditions occurs earlier than in other molecular systems. The exchange channel plays an important role in the internal energy randomization.},

Special attention is paid to the vibrational and rotational relaxations of oxygen as a result of chemically non-reactive interaction with nitrogen atoms. The vibrational relaxation of oxygen partially occurs via the formation of an intermediate NO2 complex. The efficient energy randomization results in rapid vibrational relaxation at low temperatures, compared to other molecular systems with a purely repulsive potential. The vibrational relaxation time, computed by means of master equation studies, is nearly an order of magnitude lower than the relaxation time in N2-O collisions. The rotational nonequilibrium starts to play a significant effect at translational temperatures above 8000 K.

We investigate the vibrational relaxation in diatom-atom collisions in the range of temperatures between 1000 and 10 000 K by comparing results of extensive fully quantum-mechanical and quasi-classical simulations with available experimental data. The present paper simulates the interaction of molecular oxygen with argon as the first step in developing the aerothermodynamics models based on first principles. We devise a routine to standardize such calculations also for other scattering systems. Our results demonstrate very good agreement of vibrational relaxation time, derived from quantum-mechanical calculations with the experimental measurements conducted in shock tube facilities. At the same time, the quasi-classical simulations fail to accurately predict rates of vibrationally inelastic transitions at temperatures lower than 3000 K. This observation and the computational cost of adopted methods suggest that the next generation of high fidelity thermochemical models should be a combination of quantum and quasi-classical approaches. },

The present work focuses solely on oxygen flows with an emphasis on implementing a new set of accurate state-specific rate coefficients for O2–O collisions. The two-temperature model is presented as the computationally efficient, lower-fidelity approach in this work. The two-temperature model is driven by the relaxation parameters based on the Millikan–White empirical equation as well as on the parameters resulting from a master equation simulation that employs the database of state-resolved O2–O rate coefficients. The full state-to-state master equation approach is presented as the higher-fidelity modeling approach. The O2–O system uses recently available results of trajectory simulations for state-specific transition rate coefficients The O2–O2 system uses transition rates from the forced harmonic oscillator model. The test case comparison shows that the state-resolved modeling approach is more suitable for describing the vibrational temperature and chemically nonequilibrium zone behind the shock wave. It is shown that the capability of the state-resolved model to capture non-Boltzmann distribution is critical for accurately modeling the vibrational relaxation and dissociation phase.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this study is two-fold: 1) to compare the vibrational relaxation and dissociation rate coefficients for the O2(3Σ−g )+O(3P) system between the Varandas and Pais potential energy surface (PES), and the Varga et al. 11A′ PES, and 2) to present a new set of state-to-state (STS) vibrational relaxation rate coefficients, state-specific dissociation rate coefficients, and total dissociation rate coefficients using all nine adiabatic ab initio PESs (11A′, 21A′, 11A′′, 13A′, 23A′, 13A′′, 15A′, 25A′and 15A′′) by Varga et al. These rate coefficients are calculated from collisional cross-sections obtained using the Quasi-Classical Trajectory (QCT) method for a temperature range T = 2,000 K to T = 12,000 K. Translational-rotational equilibrium is assumed. It is found that using the Varandas and Pais PES leads to vibrational energy transfer rate coefficients which are at most twice higher than those calculated for Varga et al. 11A′ PES. These differences are not very significant on the logarithmic scale of rates. STS vibrational relaxation rate coefficients for the nine Varga et al. PESs show that the PES that contributes the most towards relaxation varies significantly depending on the vibrational transition considered. This observation indicates that all 9 PESs must be taken into account to present a more complete picture of the full O2- O system. Finally, state-specific and total dissociation rate coefficients, considering cross- sections from all 9 appropriately weighted Varga et al. PESs, are calculated and reported. Contrary to vibrational relaxation, it is observed that dissociation rate coefficients are not sensitive to the 9 Varga et al. PESs.},

 abstract = {Kinetics of O2 vibrational excitation is studied during the O atom recombination in an O2-Ar mixture partially dissociated by a burst of ns discharge pulses in a flow reactor, at T = 380-650 K. Time-resolved vibrational level populations of molecular oxygen in the ground electronic state, O2(X,v=8-20), are measured by ps Laser Induced Fluorescence on the O2 Schumann Runge bands, with absolute calibration by NO LIF in a NO-N2 mixture with a known composition, at quenching-free conditions. O atom number density in the same mixture is measured by ps Two-Photon absorption LIF (TALIF). The discharge generates a diffuse volumetric plasma, without well-pronounced filaments. The temperature in the plasma is measured by Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS) of excited Ar atoms. The results indicate a rapid initial decay of the O2(X,v=8-20) molecules generated by electron impact in the discharge, on ~ 100 μs time scale, due to the V-V exchange and V-T relaxation. This decay is followed by a much slower decay, on the time scale much longer compared to the characteristic time for V-V relaxation, up to several ms. This indicates an additional process of O2(v) generation by chemical reactions initiated by the O atom recombination. This effect is observed both in the non-preheated and preheated O2-Ar mixtures. However, comparison of the time-resolved O2(v=8-13,17-20) vibrational level populations after the burst excitation of non-preheated and preheated exhibits significant differences. In the preheated mixtures, peak O2(v) populations during the slow decay following the excitation are significantly lower, suggesting a significant effect of O atom recombination via the reaction pathways involving ozone. Additional data need to be taken in preheated mixtures with the low O2 mole fraction, ~1%, and at higher pressures, at the conditions when the discharge excitation would result in dissociation of most of O2 molecules in the mixture.},

This paper brings together the multi-year effort of creating a database of kinetic rate coefficients of the same fidelity for the dominant molecular and atomic air species. Isothermal and adiabatic heat bath simulations of the 5-species air system are carried out using three separate approaches: 1) a multi-temperature model, 2) a vibrationally-resolved state-to-state model with FHO rate coefficients, and 3) a vibrationally-resolved state-to-state model with QCT rate coefficients. Time histories of vibrational temperatures and species concentrations are analyzed. The multi-temperature model is shown to underpredict the formation of nitric oxide by approximately six times in isothermal studies when compared to the present model.},

 abstract = {A novel model for the simulation of post-shock conditions in oxygen flows, using only state-specific rate coefficients calculated on accurate ab-initio potential energy surfaces is investigated. The quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) method and the triplet potential energy surface (PES) proposed by Paukku et al. (2018) are employed to generate a new O2—O2 rate coefficient database for vibrational energy transfer and dissociation in the temperature range 4,000-15,000 K. Comparison of these new kinetic data against the Forced Harmonic Oscillator (FHO) model reveals that there is a non-trivial behavior in the energy transfer between excited vibrational states which is not captured by the FHO model. The new O2—O2 rate coefficients are imported into a system of master equations coupled with conservation laws (species, momentum, and energy) to model the shock-tube experiments by Ibraguimova et al. (2013). Comparisons of the results from the present model against that of the multi-temperature model due to Park reveal that the present model improves the prediction of experimental results, specifically in the post-shock flow composition. The Modified Marronne-Treanor (MMT) by Chaudhry et al. (2018) is also tested and good agreement is noted between the present calculations and the MMT model. Parameters from the MMT model are compared against similar parameters extracted from the master equation analysis. This comparison indicates the importance of non-Boltzmann behavior, which is tracked by the master equation analysis but may not be accurately captured by the MMT model.},

 abstract = {The present paper is concerned with the computational fluid dynamic model of a cesium-wetted tungsten surface and associated thermionic emission under hypersonic flight conditions. A set of Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the finite-rate cesium-air plasma model and Ohm's law is used to model a two-dimensional viscous, thermally conductive, and thermochemically reactive hypersonic flow. Electron emission is modeled via the Richardson-Dushman equation for saturation current. Additionally, a one-dimensional full fluid moment model of plasma sheath is used to identify the onset of space charge limited emission in the presence of NO+ and Cs+ ions. The computer model, while being actively developed, is aimed to describe a closed-loop operation of an electron transpiration cooling concept of a metallic surface of a leading edge in two-dimensional geometry. A notional geometry of a 1 cm radius of curvature leading edge at Mach 14 and 60 km of altitude with assumed ideal thermionic electron emission for wall temperature of 1500K indicates that significant electron and cesium evaporation cooling is expected, and the emission may not reach the space-charge limit with sufficient amount of ions in the flow.},

Electron transpiration cooling (ETC) is proposed as a cooling mechanism for hypersonic vehicles to counter the heat flux to the surface from the ambient air. The basic idea is to cover the surface with a low work function material that emits electrons when heated. Hypersonic flow simulations are carried out to study the effectiveness of electron transpiration cooling for cesiated tungsten surfaces. The weakly ionized plasma in the hypersonic boundary layer was assumed to be quasineutral except for the sheath region. In this study, we analyze different analytical models for the sheath layer simulation especially addressing the role of the sheath edge boundary conditions. The simulations are based on the full fluid model of plasma and also include simplified models of the plasma sheath. Appropriate boundary conditions at the sheath edge for the simulation of the multidimensional hypersonic flow near the vehicle surface were formulated.},

 abstract = {The concept of electron transpiration cooling (ETC) uses thermionic emission of electrons from a low work function material to cool surfaces in hypersonic flight. A theoretical estimate of the emission current is given by the Richardson–Dushman equation. In hypersonic flights, the emission current can deviate from this estimate as the ambient air is partially ionized and a plasma sheath forms near the surface. Depending on the sheath structure, the emission current can be enhanced by the Schottky effect, or could be reduced by the space charge effects. In this study, we present a theoretical analysis of ETC of the leading-edge surface of a hypersonic vehicle, considering the transpiration of liquid cesium through a porous tungsten material. A part of the transpired cesium is adsorbed on the surface, which lowers the emitter work function, while the rest is evaporated due to high surface temperatures. Both the effects provide substantial cooling. The evaporated cesium is ionized in the ambient air, which alters the plasma conductivity and reduces space charge effects. The effect of individual fields of ionized species near the surface is found to be negligible. Cesium transpiration is found to eliminate the requirement for an applied surface potential and enable stable operation at surface temperatures below 2000 K.},

The flowfield results for the base flow is calculated using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. A collisional radiative model is constructed to obtain accurate results for the vibrational level populations of NO. This collisional radiative model will be incorporated to a mass transport equation solver (MassTR) as a source term that couples the radiation with the flow.},

 abstract = {View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-3581.vid Oxidation of ultra-high temperature ceramics is investigated by means of a mechanistic model considering individual layers of protective borosilicate glass, ZrO2 scale, SiC-depleted region, and virgin material. The model relies on the continuity of oxygen flux through these layers. Specifically, the behavior of ZrB2 and ZrB2–SiC materials in atmospheres containing O2 is presented. The sensitivity of the model to individual input parameters is investigated. Discussion of thermogravimetric measurements is provided for validation of the present model. It is shown that the porosity of the nascent ZrO2 scale needs to be varying in order to explain the accelerated gain of sample weight at high temperatures and for long exposures. The utilization of constant properties of the B2O3–SiO2–ZrO2 system does not provide an accurate description of experimental data within a wide range of conditions. The variation of porosity is unlikely to be related only to the monoclinic-tetragonal ZrO2 transformation and can be explained by anisotropic growth of ZrO2 grains in boria.},

@article{pub.1150010142,
 abstract = {A model for simulating postshock conditions using only state-resolved kinetic data of ab initio accuracy is presented. The quasi-classical trajectory method is used to compute a vibrational-specific kinetic database that describes internal energy transfer and dissociation in a nonionizing oxygen mixture. The kinetic database is implemented in a system of master equations and coupled to conservation laws to simulate a series of conditions, including zero-dimensional adiabatic reservoir, one-dimensional postincident, and one-dimensional postreflected shock relaxation. The present results are in excellent agreement with temperature profiles produced by the direct molecular simulation method at a fraction of cost. For the first time, the state-resolved model is applied to model relaxation behind a reflected shock passing through a thermally nonequilibrium gas. Model validation is made via comparisons to the experiments of Ibraguimova et al. (Journal of Chemical Physics, Vol. 139, No. 3, 2013, Paper 034317) and Streicher et al. (Physics of Fluids, Vol. 33, No. 5, 2021, Paper 056107). It is shown that neglecting relaxation in the postincident shock region may lead to nonnegligible errors in determining initial postreflected shock translational and vibrational temperatures, particularly in cases where the test gas is not diluted with an inert species.},

 abstract = {The present work considers the interaction of a continuous-wave (CW) laser with carbon-fiber reinforced polymers in the presence of a subsonic crossflow. A multi-physical approach has been developed to address this computational problem. The optical model of a plume has been coupled with the flow and material response model, encompassing the formation and transport of soot particulates. At given power densities of the laser beam the gaseous component of a plume is nearly transparent to the laser beam, and the laser beam shielding by a plume arises from soot particulates. Soot particulates do not reach the outer edge of the boundary layer due to a small diffusion coefficient compared to gaseous species. These particulates are swept downstream by the crossflow, creating a favorable window for the transmission of the laser energy to the material in terms of the crossflow velocity-laser power density envelope.},
