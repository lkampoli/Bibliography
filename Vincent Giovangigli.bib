In the neighborhood of the stagnation point produced in these flames, a chemically reacting boundary layer is established. For a given equivalence ratio, the input flow velocity can be varied and solutions can be determined for increasing values of the strain rate. As the strain rate increases, the flame nears extinction. Recent experimental, computational and theoretical work has shown that extinction of these flames can be achieved by either flame stretch or by a combination of flame stretch and incomplete chemical reaction. Extinction by flame stretch is possible when the Lewis number of the deficient reactant is greater than a critical value and extinction resulting from both flame stretch and incomplete chemical reaction is possible when the Lewis number of the deficient reactant is less than this value. In this paper we study the extinction process computationally. We model the governing conservation equations with complex transport and detailed kinetics. By employing adaptive boundary value solution methods with numerical bifurcation techniques, we generate detailed extinction curves for hydrogen-air and methane-air flames in a counterflow geometry.},

Along the stagnation point streamline the governing equations can be reduced to a system of coupled nonlinear two-point boundary value problems.

The study is performed for non-unity Lewis numbers. Flame structures and extinction curves are determined with activation energy asymptotics. When the Lewis number (thermal diffusivity over mass diffusivity of the deficient reactant) is below a critical Lewis number (greater than one) extinction occurs with the flame front at the stagnation surface. In this case extinction curves are found to be C-shaped or exceptionally S-shaped and an extension of extinction limits is possible if the catalytic surface reaction is sufficiently strong. Activation energy asymptotic results are compared to exact calculations based on Newton iterations and adaptive grids. The qualitative agreement is good and the general trends are well described by activation energy asymptotics but quantitative errors are found in the predicted extinction limits.},

 abstract = {The study of strained flames is of great interest for turbulent combustion modelling. The structure and properties of these flames are usually determined with either very simple but unrealistic one-step or modeled multiple-step kinetics or with large detailed chemical mechanisms. Recent studies initiated by Peters indicate that it may be possible to employ reduced mechanisms and still obtain accurate solutions. It is our objective to evaluate this approach in the context of propane-air flames. The reduced scheme of Peters et al. is first tested. A systematic analysis of the successive steps leading to reduced scheme is conducted. An augmented reduced mechanism which contains new species OH and O and involves additional equilibrium reactions for H2, 02 and CO2 is proposed. All the computations are compared with respect lo solutions obtained with an initial complex scheme due to Warnatz. The results obtained at atmospheric pressure are generally satisfactory. It is observed that the differences between the augmented reduced mechanism and the complex scheme vary with the parameters such as equivalence ratio and pressure. Our reduced scheme comes closest to the complex scheme for rich conditions while the reduced mechanism of Peters is more appropriate for lean flames. As pressure is increased, the results differ more markedly from the complex scheme. While flame structures are still well predicted, the flame stand off distance is not well retrieved and as a consequence the crititcal extinction value of the strain rate is not very accurate.},

Ionization takes place in the rocket combustion chamber and in the exhaust plume. A low-temperature, high-density plasma is created, with small Debye length in most of the plume region. Ambipolar diffusion is therefore assumed for ions and electrons in the plume, and a set of conservation equations is derived to be solved by the numerical model. A number of numerical strategies to resolve this system is derived, as well as a novel scheme that enforces charge neutrality. This approach is integrated into a complex code for compressible, multispecies, turbulent flow simulations. The model is then coupled with a Maxwell’s equations solver in order to simulate the radar cross section of rocket plumes. Finally, computations of ionization levels and radar cross section of a Black Brant rocket plume are presented.},

 abstract = {Non equilibrium viscous shock layer flows produced near the stagnation point of a blunt body constitute a standard problem in hypersonic flow theory. This flow configuration is usually modeled with the viscous shock layer (VSL) equations derived by writing the full Navier-Stokes equations in boundary-layer coordinates and performing an order of magnitude analysis. The terms retained in this process assure that for moderate Reynolds numbers the resulting equations are uniformly valid between the body surface and the shock, which may be treated as a thin discontinuity. The VSL equations are generally solved by starting with the thin layer approximation (TVSL). Boundary conditions are specified at the body surface and the Rankine-Hugoniot relations are imposed at the shock. Because the position of the shock is not known, one has to solve a free boundary problem. This paper presents a novel solution procedure for this situation. A reduced coordinate is introduced and the free boundary problem is transformed into a nonlinear eigenvalue problem. The new problem for an augmented set of variables is then solved with Newton iterations and adaptive gridding. The method is illustrated in the paper with a solution of the thin shock layer equations at the stagnation streamline. The solution obtained on this line is then used as an initial condition for a two-dimensional marching procedure. The complete axisymmetric problem is solved by performing fully coupled Newton iterations; moreover, we consider a new enlarged unknown function including the shock location. The model includes detailed transport properties and complex kinetics for air dissociation and ionization. However, in order to focus on the numerical method and for the sake of simplicity, thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed.},

 abstract = {A novel theoretical basis for the evaluation of the thermal conductivity and the thermal diffusion ratios of dilute polyatomic gas mixtures is derived within the semi-classical isotropic kinetic theory. New expressions for species diffusion coefficients, thermal diffusion coefficients, and thermal diffusion ratios are also obtained by using an expansion vector based upon the total energy of the molecules. Finally, practical and accurate expressions for the thermal conductivity and the thermal diffusion ratios are derived by using the recent theory of iterative transport algorithms, as developed by the authors. The resulting expressions can be used in either theoretical calculations or computational models of multicomponent flows.},

Our model is based on the thermodynamics of irreversible processes, statistical mechanics, statistical thermodynamics, and the kinetic theory of dense gases. We study thermodynamic properties, chemical production rates, transport fluxes, and establish that entropy production is non-negative. We next investigate the structure of planar transcritical H2–O2–N2 flames and perform a sensitivity analysis with respect to the model. Non-idealities in the equation of state and in the transport fluxes have a dramatic influence on the cold zone of the flame. Non-idealities in the chemical production rates – consistent with thermodynamics and important to insure positivity of entropy production – may also strongly influence flame structures at very high pressures. At sufficiently low temperatures, fresh mixtures of H2–O2–N2 flames are found to be thermodynamically unstable, in agreement with experimental results. We finally study the influence of various parameters associated with the initial reactants on the structure of transcritical planar H2–O2–N2 flames as well as lean and rich extinction limits.},

 abstract = {The goal of this is book to give a detailed presentation of multicomponent flow models and to investigate the mathematical structure and properties of the resulting system of partial differential equations. These developments are also illustrated by simulating numerically a typical laminar flame. Our aim in the chapters is to treat the general situation of multicomponent flows, taking into account complex chemistry and detailed transport phe­ nomena. In this book, we have adopted an interdisciplinary approach that en­ compasses a physical, mathematical, and numerical point of view. In par­ ticular, the links between molecular models, macroscopic models, mathe­ matical structure, and mathematical properties are emphasized. We also often mention flame models since combustion is an excellent prototype of multicomponent flow. This book still does not pretend to be a complete survey of existing models and related mathematical results. In particular, many subjects like multi phase-flows , turbulence modeling, specific applications, porous me­ dia, biological models, or magneto-hydrodynamics are not covered. We rather emphasize the fundamental modeling of multicomponent gaseous flows and the qualitative properties of the resulting systems of partial dif­ ferential equations. Part of this book was taught at the post-graduate level at the Uni­ versity of Paris, the University of Versailles, and at Ecole Poly technique in 1998-1999 to students of applied mathematics.},

@book{pub.1021009880,
 abstract = {With the advent of sophisticated computer technology and the development of efficient computational algorithms, numerical modeling of complex multicomponent laminar reacting flows has emerged as an increasingly popular and firmly established area of scientific research. Progress in this area aims at obtaining better resolved and more accurate solutions of specific technological problems in less computer time. Therefore, it strongly relies upon the ability of evaluating fundamental parameters appearing in the physical models. Transport properties constitute a typical example of the above characterization. Evaluating transport coefficients of dilute polyatomic gas mixtures is often critical in many engineering applications, including chemical reactors, hypersonic flows, comb- tion phenomena, and chemical vapor deposition. Using the kinetic theory of dilute polyatomic gas mixtures as a starting point, this book offers a systematic development of a mathematical and numerical theory for the evaluation of transport properties in dilute polyatomic gas mixtures. The present investigation is not specifically.about the kinetic theory of gases, for which there are plenty of excellent and thoroughly do- mented textbooks; it is rather geared toward the development of new, efficient, and general algorithms with which to evaluate transport properties of dilute polyatomic gas mixtures at a reasonable computational cost.},

 abstract = {The composition flammability limits of freely propagating premixed hydrogen-air and methane-air flames are investigated. A modified formulation of the plane premixed laminar flame problem is first derived. The resulting parameterized nonlinear two-point boundary value problem is then solved by phase-space, pseudo arclength, continuation methods that employ Euler predictors, Newton-like iterations and adaptive gridding techniques. The efficiency of the method is illustrated by studying the dependence of the peak temperature and the adiabatic flame speed on the equivalence ratio of hydrogen-air and methane-air mixtures. In particular, we discuss the calculation of lean and rich extinction limits in the absence of heat losses. These composition limits for plane adiabatic flames are shown to be physically irrelevant turning points due to flame thickening in finite length computational domains. These artificial turning points are also shown to be dependent on the length of the computational domain.},

In the neighborhood of the stagnation point produced in these flames, a chemically reacting boundary layer is established. For a given equivalence ratio, the input flow velocity can be varied and solutions can be determined for increasing values of the strain rate. As the strain rate increases, the flame nears extinction. In the vicinity of the extinction point, however, the Jacobian of the system becomes singular. To avoid computational difficulties, we employ numerical bifurcation techniques to generate the approriate steady-state profiles (both physical and nonphysical).

In the coflow configuration, a modified vorticity–velocity formulation is used and the governing equations are solved on an adaptively refined grid using pseudo-transient continuation and Newton’s method nested with a Bi-CGSTAB iterative linear system solver. All transport coefficients, including thermal diffusion coefficients, are evaluated using cost-effective, accurate algorithms derived from the kinetic theory of gases. The numerical results for the counterflow model provide a quantitative assessment of the effects of detailed multicomponent transport and thermal diffusion on soot concentrations as a function of strain rate for both a diffusion flame and partially premixed flame. The fidelity of the commonly used Fickian diffusion model is tested and it is shown that in certain cases, the impacts of detailed multicomponent transport and thermal diffusion modeling on soot concentrations are significant. The numerical results for the coflow model demonstrate that although minimal changes in flame shape and temperature profiles arise when transport models are varied, changes in the soot profiles can be seen.},

 abstract = {Higher order entropies are kinetic entropy estimators for fluid models. These quantities are quadratic in the velocity and temperature derivatives and have temperature dependent coefficients. We investigate governing equations for higher order entropies and related a priori estimates in the natural situation where viscosity and thermal conductivity depend on temperature. We establish positivity of higher order derivative source terms in these governing equations provided that $$|| \log T||_{BMO}+||v/\sqrt{T}||_{L}\infty$$ is small enough. The temperature factors renormalizing temperature and velocity derivatives then yield majorization of lower order convective terms only when the temperature dependence of transport coefficients is taken into account according to the kinetic theory. In this situation, we obtain entropic principles for higher order entropies of arbitrary order. As an application, we investigate a priori estimates and global existence of solutions when the initial values log(T0/T∞) and $$v_0/\sqrt{T}_{0}$$ are small enough in appropriate spaces.},

@article{pub.1036374820,
 abstract = {Recent advances in the development of computational algorithms, reaction kinetics, and mainframe supercomputers have enabled the combustion scientist to investigate chemically reacting systems that were computationally infeasible only a few years ago. In particular, the coupling of adaptive numerical methods with large memory parallel/vector computers has produced an extremely powerful tool with which to probe flame structure. The difficulties in solving high heat release combustion problems, such as flames, center on the large number of equations that must be solved for the elementary chemical species, the exponential nonlinearities that occur in the governing partial differential equations, and the disparate length scales that must be resolved in the computed solution. In this paper we investigate numerically one such reacting system—the axisymmetric laminar diffusion flame. Such flames are important in the interaction of heat and mass transfer with chemical reactions in gas turbines and commercial burners. The ability to predict the coupled effects of complex transport phenomena with detailed chemical kinetics in these flames is critical in modeling turbulent reacting flows, in improving engine efficiency, and in understanding the processes by which pollutants are formed. In our study we consider an unconfined configuration in which a cylindrical fuel stream is surrounded by a coflowing oxidizer jet. Computationally, we solve the governing conservation equations of mass, momentum, species balance, and energy with detailed transport and finite rate chemistry submodels. A discrete solution is obtained on a two-dimensional grid by employing Newton's method with adaptive mesh refinement. Unlike some models in which diffusion in the axial direction is neglected, we consider the fully elliptic problem. The computations are performed in parallel using up to six processors of an IBM ES/3090 600J. The study undertaken in this paper represents the first time that hydrocarbon chemistry with two carbon atoms has been modeled in an elliptic formulation of a laminar flame. The results of this investigation can enable the combustion scientist to probe the fluid dynamics-thermochemistry interaction and its effect on the structure of coflowing methane-air diffusion flames. The study also illustrates the applicability of partial equilibrium/full equilibrium chemistry approximations in diffusion flames and provides an assessment of the use of mole fraction versus mixture fraction correlations for flamelet models of turbulent combustion.},

@article{pub.1041883036,
 abstract = {A large amount of hydrogen can be released into the containment of light water reactors during a severe accident. Passive Auto-catalytic Recombiners (PARs) aim to avoid flame acceleration and excessive pressure loads on the containment in case of hydrogen combustion. Their operation is based on the catalytic recombination of hydrogen into steam in the presence of oxygen. Thus, the recombiners reduce the hydrogen but also the oxygen content in the containment atmosphere. As a consequence, the oxygen/nitrogen ratio diverts more and more from the standard 21vol.% in air. This decreasing ratio may impact on the PAR efficiency. Additionally, the exothermic surface chemical mechanism leads to the overheating of the catalytic plates and activates the natural convection inside the recombiners. This heat source can also create local conditions for hydrogen combustion in the gas phase, as igniters do. Hence, the oxygen/nitrogen ratio may also determine the conditions for the gas-phase ignition inside PARs. This study deals with the numerical simulation of the impact of the oxygen starvation (i.e. low oxygen/nitrogen ratio) on the PAR efficiency and on the PAR gas-phase ignition limit. Calculations are performed with a dedicated CFD code named SPARK. We focus on the interaction of recombiners with any H2/O2/N2/H2O mixtures and thus establish a quite complete understanding of PAR operation. Calculations confirm the experimental oxygen surplus (i.e. twice more oxygen than stoichiometry) necessary to ensure an optimal PAR efficiency (XO2≈XH2) independently of the steam content. The PAR gas-phase ignition limit is then determined numerically in the classical H2/Air/H2O ternary diagram with a very good agreement with the available experimental database. It points out the importance of catalyst heat radiation, and more secondarily of species thermal diffusion (i.e. Soret effect). Finally, the PAR gas-phase ignition limit is determined for all oxygen/nitrogen ratios. The ignition domain appears to strongly contract when the oxygen content decreases, so that the steam threshold for inertization of the containment with respect to the recombiners ignition becomes very low.},

A lean limit equivalence ratio of 0.0866 is predicted and a rich limit of 2.828. For any equivalence ratio between the two limits there are two solutions. One is characterized by a small flame, incomplete reactant consumption, and negligible radiation losses. The other by a large flame, complete consumption of one of the reactants, and significatn radiation losses. The maximum temperature varies between 1200 and 900 K as the two solution branches are traversed. Much of our discussion is a reprise and modification of previously published analytical results, for these provide physical insight into the nature of the solutions, and suggest that a portion of the large flame branch near the lean limit is stable and so corresponds to observable flames.},

 abstract = {A multiradii spray flame model is derived in a kinetic framework in which the droplets' distribution function is taken as a sum of delta products. The droplet class equations are obtained by taking moments of the Boltzmann-type spray equation. The gas-phase equations are coupled to the droplets equations through various integral sources terms. In the counterflow geometry, using a self-similar assumption, multiradii counterflow spray flame models are then obtained as exact solutions of multidimensional small Mach number governing equations. The structure of multiradii counterflow spray flames is investigated numerically. To solve the discretized system of equation, a fully coupled adaptive computation was conducted between the gas and liquid phase. The equations are discretized by using a finite difference, and highly optimized libraries were used in order to evaluate thermochemistry and transport properties. We first investigate an n-heptane counterflow monodisperse spray flame studied experimentally by Chen and Gomez. We then investigate a multiradii methanol spray flame studied experimentally by Gomez and coworkers. The multiradii approach is used in order to describe accurately the multiple size behavior, which is found to be strongly radius-dependent. Good agreement is found in both cases up to experimental uncertainties in the measured injection velocities and class number densities.},

We first investigate a nonequilibrium gas model with two temperatures—translational and internal—where the volume viscosity is absent. We establish that in a relaxation regime, the temperature difference becomes proportional to the divergence of the velocity fields and define a nonequilibrium, multitemperature, volume viscosity coefficient. We next analyze the convergence of the two temperature model towards the one temperature model when the relaxation is fast. We then investigate a nonequilibrium two temperature gas model with a fast and a slow internal energy mode. We establish that in a relaxation regime, there are four contributions to the volume viscosity, namely, the fast internal mode volume viscosity, the slow internal mode volume viscosity, the relaxation pressure, and the perturbed source term. In the thermodynamic equilibrium limit, the sum of these four terms converges toward the one-temperature two-mode volume viscosity. We finally perform Monte Carlo simulations of spontaneous fluctuations near thermodynamic equilibrium. The numerical results obtained from the Boltzmann equation are compared to the predictions of the one and two temperature fluid models, and the agreement between theory and calculations is complete.},

 abstract = {The authors investigate the performance of several preconditioned conjugate gradient-like algorithms and a standard stationary iterative method (block-line successive overrelaxation (SOR)) on linear systems of equations that arise from a nonlinear elliptic flame sheet problem simulation. The nonlinearity forces a pseudotransient continuation process that makes the problem parabolic and thus compacts the spectrum of the Jacobian matrix so that simple relaxation methods are viable in the initial stages of the solution process. However, because of the transition from parabolic to elliptic character as the timestep is increased in pursuit of the steady-state solution, the performance of the candidate linear solvers spreads as the domain of convergence of Newtons method is approached. In numerical experiments over the course of a full nonlinear solution trajectory, short recurrence or optimal Krylov algorithms combined with a GaussSeidel (GS) preconditioning yield better execution times with respect to the standard block-line SOR techniques, but SOR performs competitively at a smaller storage cost until the final stages. Block-incomplete factorization preconditioned methods, on the other hand, require nearly a factor of two more storage than SOR and are uniformly less effective during the pseudotransient stages. The advantage of GS preconditioning is partly attributable to the exploitation of a dominant convection direction in the examples; nevertheless, a multidomain version of GS with streamwise coupling lagged at rows between adjacent subdomains incurs only a modest penalty.},

@article{pub.1112227483,
 abstract = {Despite 150 years of research after the reference work of Stokes, it should be acknowledged that some confusion still remains in the literature regarding the importance of bulk viscosity effects in flows of both academic and practical interests. On the one hand, it can be readily shown that the neglection of bulk viscosity (i.e., κ = 0 ) is strictly exact for mono-atomic gases. The corresponding bulk viscosity effects are also unlikely to alter the flowfield dynamics provided that the ratio of the shear viscosity μ to the bulk viscosity κ remains sufficiently large. On the other hand, for polyatomic gases, the scattered available experimental and numerical data show that it is certainly not zero and actually often far from negligible. Therefore, since the ratio κ ∕ μ can display significant variations and may reach very large values (it can exceed thirty for dihydrogen), it remains unclear to what extent the neglection of κ holds. The purpose of the present study is thus to analyze the mechanisms through which bulk viscosity and associated processes may alter a canonical turbulent flow. In this context, we perform direct numerical simulations (DNS) of spatially-developing compressible non-reactive and reactive hydrogen–air shear layers interacting with an oblique shock wave. The corresponding flowfield is of special interest for various reactive high-speed flow applications, e.g., scramjets. The corresponding computations either neglect the influence of bulk viscosity ( κ = 0 ) or take it into consideration by evaluating its value using the EGlib library. The qualitative inspection of the results obtained for two-dimensional cases in either the presence or the absence of bulk viscosity effects shows that the local and instantaneous structure of the mixing layer may be deeply altered when taking bulk viscosity into account. This contrasts with some mean statistical quantities, e.g., the vorticity thickness growth rate, which do not exhibit any significant sensitivity to the bulk viscosity. Enstrophy, Reynolds stress components, and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budgets are then evaluated from three-dimensional reactive simulations. Slight modifications are put into evidence on the energy transfer and dissipation contributions. From the obtained results, one may expect that refined large-eddy simulations (LES) may be rather sensitive to the consideration of bulk viscosity, while Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) simulations, which are based on statistical averages, are not.},

 abstract = {In most simulations of fine particles in reacting flows, including sooting
flames, enthalpy exchanges between gas and particle phases and differential
diffusion between the two phases are most often neglected, since the particle
mass fraction is generally very small. However, when the nanoparticles mass
fraction is very large representing up to 50% of the mixture mass, the
conservation of the total enthalpy and/or the total mass becomes critical. In
the present paper, we investigate the impact of mass and enthalpy conservation
in the modeling of titania nanoparticles synthesis in flames, classically
characterized by a high conversation rate and consequently a high nanoparticles
concentration. It is shown that when the nanoparticles concentration is high,
neglecting the enthalpy of the particle phase may lead to almost 70% relative
error on the temperature profile and to relative errors on the main titania
species mass fractions and combustion products ranging from 20% to 100%. It is
also established that neglecting the differential diffusion of the gas phase
with respect to the particle phase is also significant, with almost 15%
relative error on the TiO$_2$ mole fraction, although the effect on combustion
products is minor.},

 abstract = {We present a full derivation of capillary fluid equations from the kinetic theory of dense gases. These equations involve van der Waals' gradient energy, Korteweg's tensor, and Dunn and Serrin's heat flux as well as viscous and heat dissipative fluxes. Starting from macroscopic equations obtained from the kinetic theory of dense gases, we use a second-order expansion of the pair distribution function in order to derive the diffuse interface model. The capillary extra terms and the capillarity coefficient are then associated with intermolecular forces and the pair interaction potential.},

 abstract = {A kinetic theory describing chemical reactions on crystal surfaces is introduced. Kinetic equations are used to model physisorbed-gas particles and chemisorbed particles interacting with fixed potentials and colliding with phonons. The phonons are assumed to be at equilibrium and the physisorbed-gas and chemisorbed species equations are coupled to similar kinetic equations describing crystal atoms on the surface. An arbitrary number of gaseous species, surface species and heterogeneous chemical reactions are considered and the species may be polyatomic. A kinetic entropy is introduced for the coupled system and the H theorem is established. Using a fluid scaling and a Chapman–Enskog method, fluid boundary conditions are derived from the kinetic model and involve complex surface chemistry as well as surface tangential multicomponent diffusion.},

@article{pub.1135454114,
 abstract = {In most simulations of fine particles in reacting flows, including sooting flames, enthalpy exchanges between gas and particle phases and differential diffusion between the two phases can be neglected, since the particle mass fraction is generally very small. However, when the nanoparticles mass fraction is very large representing up to 50% of the mixture mass, the conservation of the total enthalpy and/or the total mass becomes critical. In the present paper, we investigate the impact of mass and enthalpy conservation in the modelling of titania nanoparticles synthesis in flames, classically characterised by a high conversation rate and consequently a high nanoparticles concentration. It is shown that when the nanoparticles concentration is high, neglecting the enthalpy of the particle phase may lead to almost 70% relative error on the temperature profile and to relative errors on the main titania species mass fractions and combustion products ranging from 20% to 100%. It is also established that neglecting the differential diffusion of the gas phase with respect to the particle phase is also significant, with almost 15% relative error on the TiO mole fraction, although the effect on combustion products is minor.},

 abstract = {Boundary conditions for the Boltzmann equation are investigated on the basis of a kinetic model for gas-surface interactions. The model takes into account gas and physisorbed molecules interacting with a surface potential and colliding with phonons. The potential field is generated by fixed crystal molecules, and the interaction with phonons represents the fluctuating part of the surface. The interaction layer is assumed to be thinner than the mean free path of the gas and physisorbed molecules, and the phonons are assumed to be at equilibrium. The asymptotic kinetic equation for the inner physisorbate layer is derived and used to investigate gas distribution boundary conditions. To be more specific, a model of the boundary condition for the Boltzmann equation is derived on the basis of an approximate iterative solution of the kinetic equation for the physisorbate layer, and the quality of the model is assessed by detailed numerical simulations, which also clarify the behavior of the molecules in the layer.},

 abstract = {Internal energy relaxation processes in fluid models derived from the kinetic theory are revisited, as are related bulk viscosity coefficients. The apparition of bulk viscosity coefficients in relaxation regimes and the links with equilibrium one-temperature bulk viscosity coefficients are discussed. First, a two-temperature model with a single internal energy mode is investigated, then a two-temperature model with two internal energy modes and finally a state-to-state model for mixtures of gases. All these models lead to a unique physical interpretation of the apparition of bulk viscosity effects when relaxation characteristic times are smaller than fluid times. Monte Carlo numerical simulations of internal energy relaxation processes in model gases are then performed, and power spectrums of density fluctuations are computed. When the energy relaxation time is smaller than the fluid time, both the two temperature and the single-temperature model including bulk viscosity yield a satisfactory description. When the energy relaxation time is larger than the fluid time, however, only the two-temperature model is in agreement with Boltzmann equation. The quantum population of a He-H2 mixture is also simulated with detailed He-H2 cross sections, and the resulting bulk viscosity evaluated from the Green–Kubo formula is in agreement with the theory. The impact of bulk viscosity in fluid mechanics is also addressed, as well as various mathematical aspects of internal energy relaxation and Chapman–Enskog asymptotic expansion for a two-temperature fluid model.},

 abstract = {We investigate compressible nonisothermal diffuse interface fluid models also termed capillary fluids. Such fluid models involve van der Waals’ gradient energy, Korteweg’s tensor, Dunn and Serrin’s heat flux as well as diffusive fluxes. The density gradient is added as an extra variable and the convective and capillary fluxes of the augmented system are identified by using the Legendre transform of entropy. The augmented system of equations is recast into a normal form with symmetric hyperbolic first order terms, symmetric dissipative second order terms and antisymmetric capillary second order terms. New a priori estimates are obtained for such augmented system of equations in normal form. The time derivatives of the parabolic components are less regular than for standard hyperbolic–parabolic systems and the strongly coupling antisymmetric fluxes yields new majorizing terms. Using the augmented system in normal form and the a priori estimates, local existence of strong solutions is established in an Hilbertian framework.},
