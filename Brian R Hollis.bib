 abstract = {In this chapter, the aerothermodynamic phenomena of blunt body entry vehicles are discussed. Four topics will be considered that present challenges to current computational modeling techniques for blunt body environments: turbulent flow, non-equilibrium flow, rarefied flow, and radiation transport. Examples of comparisons between computational tools to ground and flight-test data will be presented in order to illustrate the challenges existing in the numerical modeling of each of these phenomena and to provide test cases for evaluation of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code predictions.},

@article{pub.1003957206,
 abstract = {The boundary-layer transition characteristics and convective aeroheating levels on mid lift-to-drag ratio entry vehicle configurations have been studied through wind-tunnel testing. Several configurations were investigated, including elliptically blunted cylinders with both circular and elliptically flattened cross sections, biconic geometries based on launch vehicle dual-use shrouds, and parametrically optimized analytic geometries. Vehicles of this class have been proposed for high-mass Mars missions, such as sample return and crewed exploration, for which the conventional sphere-cone entry-vehicle geometries of previous Mars missions are insufficient. Testing was conducted at Mach 6 over a range of Reynolds numbers sufficient to generate laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow. Transition onset locations, both straight-line and cross-flow, and heating rates were obtained through global phosphor thermography. Supporting computations were performed to obtain heating rates for comparison with the data. Laminar data and predictions agreed to well within the experimental uncertainty. Fully turbulent data and predictions also agreed well. However, in transitional flow regions, greater differences were observed.},

 abstract = {An experimental and numerical study on the Mars Pathfinder aeroshell vehicle has been carried out in the framework of an agreement between ONERA and NASA. The experimental work was performed in the ONERA R5Ch hypersonic wind tunnel. Flowfield visualizations and heat-flux measurements along the model have been obtained. Numerical simulations have been performed at ONERA with the Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) solver NASCA and at NASA with a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) code. The flowfield structure is correctly reproduced by both computations. The location of the bow shock is well predicted, as well as the expansion waves emanating from the end of the forebody cone. Both computations also predict the same extension of the separation bubble in the base flow region of the model. Measured and calculated heat-flux distributions along the model have been compared. Both computations give similar results, except for the prediction of the heat-flux level on the afterbody cone. But computations overpredict the measured heat-flux values on the forebody and the model sting: the value of the stagnation point is overestimated at 28% and the average sting level at 35%.},

@article{pub.1037006285,
 abstract = {The Mars Science Laboratory heat shield was designed to withstand a fully turbulent heat pulse using information from ground testing and computational analysis on a preflight design trajectory. Instrumentation on the flight heat shield measured in-depth temperatures to permit reconstruction of the surface heating. The data indicate that boundary-layer transition occurred at five of seven measurement locations before peak heating. Data oscillations at three pressure measurement locations may also indicate transition. This paper presents the heat shield temperature and pressure data, possible explanations for the timing of boundary-layer transition, and a comparison of reconstructed and computational heating on the actual trajectory. A smooth-wall boundary-layer Reynolds number that was used to predict transition is compared with observed transition at various heat shield locations. A single transition Reynolds number criterion does not uniformly explain the timing of boundary-layer transition observed during flight. A roughness-based Reynolds number suggests that transition due to discrete or distributed roughness elements occurred. However, the distributed roughness height from acreage heat shield material would have needed to be larger than expected. The instrumentation confirmed the predicted location of maximum turbulent heat flux near the lee-side shoulder. The reconstructed heat flux at that location is bounded by smooth-wall turbulent convective heating, indicating that a significant augmentation due to surface roughness did not occur. Turbulent heating on the downstream side of the heat shield nose exceeded smooth-wall convective levels, assuming a supercatalytic surface, indicating that roughness may have augmented heating. The stagnation region heating also exceeded calculated convective heating; the cause of elevated heating may be attributed to a combination of shock-layer radiation and a heating augmentation of unknown origin that was also evident in ground test data.},

 abstract = {An extensive database of heating, pressure, and flowfield measurements on a 70 deg sphere-cone blunt-body geometry in high-enthalpy carbon-dioxide flow has been generated through testing in an expansion tunnel. This database is intended to support development and validation of computational tools and methods to be employed in the design of future Mars missions. The test was conducted in an expansion tunnel in order to avoid uncertainties in the definition of freestream conditions noted in previous studies performed in reflected shock tunnels. Data were obtained across a wide range of test velocity/density conditions that produced various physical phenomena of interest, including laminar and transitional/turbulent boundary layers, nonreacting to completely dissociated postshock gas composition and shock-layer radiation. Flowfield computations were performed at the test conditions, and comparisons were made with the experimental data. Based on these comparisons, it was recommended that computational uncertainties on surface heating and pressure for laminar reacting-gas environments could be reduced to ±10 and ±5%, respectively. However, for flows with turbulence and shock-layer radiation, sufficient validation-quality data were not obtained in this study to make any conclusions with respect to uncertainties for those phenomena, which highlighted the need for further research in these areas.},

 abstract = {The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) spacecraft is being designed to carry a large rover $(>800\ {\rm kg})$ to the surface of Mars using a blunt-body entry capsule as the primary decelerator. The spacecraft is being designed for launch in 2009 and arrival at Mars in 2010. The combination of large mass and diameter with non-zero angle-of-attack for MSL will result in unprecedented convective heating environments caused by turbulence prior to peak heating. Navier-Stokes computations predict a large turbulent heating augmentation for which there are no supporting flight datal and little ground data for validation. Consequently, an extensive experimental program has been established specifically for MSL to understand the level of turbulent augmentation expected in flight. The experimental data support the prediction of turbulent transition and have also uncovered phenomena that cannot be replicated with available computational methods. The result is that the flight aeroheating environments predictions must include larger uncertainties than are typically used” for a Mars entry capsule. Finally, the thermal protection system (TPS) being used for MSL has not been flown at the heat flux, pressure, and shear stress combinations expected in flight, so a test program has been established to obtain conditions relevant to flight. This paper summarizes the aero thermo dynamic definition analysis and TPS development, focusing on the challenges that are unique to MSL.},

 abstract = {The status of aerothermal analysis for Mars entry missions is reviewed. The aeroheating environment of all Mars missions to date has been dominated by convective heating. Two primary uncertainties in our ability to predict forebody convective heating are turbulence on a blunt lifting cone and surface catalysis in a CO2 environment. Future missions, particularly crewed vehicles, will encounter additional heating from shock-layer radiation due to a combination of larger size and faster entry velocity. Uncertainties inherent in the physical models employed to predict these phenomena are explored. Capabilities of ground test facilities to support aeroheating validation are also summarized. Engineering flight data from the Viking and Pathfinder missions, which may be useful for aerothermal model validation, are discussed. Examples are taken from past, present, and future Mars entry missions, including the twin Mars Exploration Rovers and the Mars Science Laboratory, scheduled for launch in 2009.},

@article{pub.1103153458,
 abstract = {The aerothermodynamic environment of a hypersonic inflatable aerodynamic decelerator with a flexible thermal protection system has been investigated through wind-tunnel testing. Boundary-layer transition onset locations and surface heating distributions were measured using global phosphor thermography on deflected, solid-surface models representative of a hypersonic inflatable aerodynamic decelerator aeroshell with a flexible surface. Data were obtained at Mach 6 for a wide range of surface deflection heights, angles of attack, and freestream Reynolds numbers. The surface deflections resulted in earlier boundary-layer transition onset and higher heating levels than for a smooth-wall surface, with the greatest effects occurring on the leeward side of the aeroshell. The heating augmentation and transition onset data were correlated using flowfield properties obtained from a complementary computational study. A method was developed to estimate flexible thermal protection system deflection effects using these correlations along with smooth-wall flowfield predictions. This method was validated through comparisons to the wind-tunnel data and then used to generate postflight predictions for aeroshell heating levels of the Inflatable Reentry Vehicle Experiment flight-test program. The results of this study provide a means for estimating flexible thermal protection system deflection effects for future flight tests as well as an experimental database for use in the development and validation of computational methods for simulations of hypersonic inflatable aerodynamic decelerator aerothermodynamic environments.},

 abstract = {A database of heating and pressure measurements on a 7 deg half-angle cone in a high-enthalpy expansion tunnel in CO2 has been generated to support development and validation of computational models to be employed in the design of future Mars missions. Laminar, transitional, and turbulent simulations were performed at the test conditions for comparisons with the data. Close agreement was obtained for both fully laminar and fully turbulent conditions. For the remaining transitional/turbulent conditions, agreement to within, or slightly more than, the estimated experimental uncertainty was demonstrated. The influence of transition intermittency and transition length models on predicted heating levels was demonstrated, as were differences in turbulent heating predictions generated using various algebraic, one-equation, and two-equation turbulence models. These comparisons provide some measure of confidence in turbulent simulation capabilities; however, because the data were not obtained on a relevant entry vehicle geometry, it is not possible to fully quantify computational uncertainties for the definition of Mars mission aerothermodynamic environments at this time.},

 abstract = {An analysis of distributed roughness effects on boundary-layer transition for hemispherical nose tips has been conducted using archival data and new data generated through hypersonic wind-tunnel testing of hemisphere models with distributed roughness at Mach 6 and Mach 10. The historical data consist of a set of flight, wind-tunnel, and ballistic-range tests spanning more than 50 years of transition research. Flowfield solutions were generated for all new and archival test points to obtain boundary-layer transition parameters. The applicability of roughness-effect correlations developed for ballistic-range data and for wind-tunnel data was evaluated using these experimental data and the computed flowfield parameters. A new correlation was proposed that provides a better agreement between ballistic-range and wind-tunnel data than previous correlations.},
