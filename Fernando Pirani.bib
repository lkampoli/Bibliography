 abstract = {A variety of phenomena of apparently different nature can be compacted and described within a unifying picture by taking into account the role of the charge transfer interaction. Relevant information on this interaction is obtained by the analysis of bond stabilization in halides, oxides, sulphides and ionic dimers of rare gases. Most of this information comes from recent molecular beam experiments: when combined with the analysis of processes occurring at crossings between covalent and ionic states in alkali halides it leads to the characterization of the dependence of the charge transfer matrix element on basic physical properties of the interacting partners. The magnitude of the coupling matrix element is correlated to polarizabilities and charges. Its exponential decreasing with intermolecular distance is given in terms of ionization potentials and electron affinities, in the spirit of the study by Grice and Herschbach (Molec. Phys., 1973, 27, 159) on the long-range configuration interaction of ionic and covalent states. A proper representation is obtained both for the transition from van der Waals to chemical bonds and for the behaviour of different families of compounds, such as those of alkali halides and of rare-gas protonated systems.},

 abstract = {The rate coefficients for N2-N2 collision-induced vibrational energy exchange (important for the enhancement of several modern innovative technologies) have been computed over a wide range of temperature. Potential energy surfaces based on different formulations of the intramolecular and intermolecular components of the interaction have been used to compute quasiclassically and semiclassically some vibrational to vibrational energy transfer rate coefficients. Related outcomes have been rationalized in terms of state-to-state probabilities and cross sections for quasi-resonant transitions and deexcitations from the first excited vibrational level (for which experimental information are available). On this ground, it has been possible to spot critical differences on the vibrational energy exchange mechanisms supported by the different surfaces (mainly by their intermolecular components) in the low collision energy regime, though still effective for temperatures as high as 10,000 K. It was found, in particular, that the most recently proposed intermolecular potential becomes the most effective in promoting vibrational energy exchange near threshold temperatures and has a behavior opposite to the previously proposed one when varying the coupling of vibration with the other degrees of freedom.},

 abstract = {The study of size-specific interactions of alkali ions (M+) with aromatic compounds is crucial to understand the mechanisms governing the selectivity in protein channels. In particular, the investigation of the aqueous solvent effect on M+–π systems is of fundamental importance. The related processes are typically governed by several intermolecular interaction contributions as hydrogen bonds, dispersion, induction and electrostatics, which are often weak and difficult to evaluate in detail. In the present paper, the behavior of the M+–Benzene (M=Na, K, Rb, Benzene=Bz) aggregates surrounded by water molecules is analyzed performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. As the accuracy of such simulations depends on the reliability of the used intermolecular potential energy formulation we adopt a potential model based on a combination of electrostatic and non electrostatic components, whose reliability has been previously tested on some prototype systems by comparing predictions of the model with both accurate ab initio calculations and/or high level experimental data, has been used. The non electrostatic component has been described as sum of improved Lennard Jones (ILJ) functions, whose parameters have been derived from polarizabilities of atoms, groups of atoms and/or molecules. The electrostatic contribution has been calculated as a sum of Coulombic potentials arising from the interaction between permanent ion charge and/or permanent molecular charge distributions, which, at long range, for M+–Bz, H2O–Bz and M+–H2O reproduces the ion-quadrupole, dipole-quadrupole and the ion-dipole interactions, respectively. Energetics and structure of the clusters are found to depend on the competition between ion and benzene solvations. MD results show that while the solvation of the ion originates a diminution of the M+–Bz interaction, that of the aromatic compound enhances its interaction with the ion. Moreover, it has been found that such behavior is size-specific dependent.},

 abstract = {The main point of this paper concerns the theoretical characterisation of the effects induced by the intermolecular interaction on the electron density upon the formation of CH4-H2X (X=O,S) and CH4–Ng (Ng=Ar,Xe) complexes. The work has been stimulated by recent molecular scattering beams experiments, which point out differences in both strength and anisotropy of the intermolecular potential between CH4–H2X respect to reference CH4–Ng systems. Herein, attention is focused on the electronic charge polarisation and particularly charge transfer (CT) effects between involved partners, directly related to the topology of the full potential energy surface. The modification of electron density and the occurrence of CT have been evaluated via the charge displacement function worked out by high level ab initio calculations. Moreover, in the case of a specific configuration of CH4–H2O system, we define the leading interaction components, including their relative stabilising role and test our intermolecular potential model with reference to ab initio calculations. The results obtained indicate that CT clearly affects the strength and the anisotropy of CH4–H2O complex, and covers a minor and negligible role for CH4–H2S and the noble gas complexes, respectively.},

Their critical comparison is exploited not only to identify those systems where the intermolecular bond is not simply due to the balancing of size repulsion with dispersion and induction attraction, but also to establish the amount of bond stabilization by charge-transfer effects. Such experimental findings are analyzed through extensive and accurate ab initio calculations, addressed at discovering the relevant differences in the basic features of the potential energy surfaces. In particular, we have analyzed in detail the prototype H2S, H2O–Kr systems and found pronounced differences in the dependence of the interaction nature and energy on the relative orientation of the colliding systems. Using the recently proposed charge-displacement analysis we have been able to quantitatively assess charge-transfer effects, which differ significantly in the two systems and exhibit different stereoselectivity.

 abstract = {A recently formulated intermolecular potential has been adapted to describe the interaction of the N-methylacetamide (NMA) dimer and of the NMA-H(2)O adduct. The pure electrostatic component of the intermolecular potential functional representation is as usual expressed in terms of a set of punctual charges distributed over the molecular frames, consistently with the permanent molecular dipole values. In contrast, the remainder of the intermolecular potential is expressed in terms of Improved Lennard Jones effective pair potential functions, referred to multiple interaction centers (or sites) placed on the N-methylacetamide molecule and to a single interaction center placed on the water molecule. The characteristic of this pair potential relies on a mix of transferable and non-transferable descriptions of the parameters. The first set of parameters has a structural connotation bearing a site-site interaction nature and exploiting the molecular polarizability decomposability. The second one, depending on the particles clustering and charge distribution and transfer, bears a delocalized and ambient bulk nature. This choice has been tested against ab initio calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that the model potential is appropriate for describing the energetic of the various stable configurations of NMA-NMA and NMA-H(2)O weakly interacting aggregates, including the formation of hydrogen bonds.},

 abstract = {Recent developments concerning the generation of molecular beams containing oriented/aligned molecules will be reviewed and applications of such tools to the study of elementary processes occurring both in homogeneous and heterogeneous phases will be presented. First we will discuss the case of symmetric top molecules oriented by hexapoles. Here the molecular polarization is obtained by the use of an external field and allows to control which end of the molecular projectile is going to collide with the target. Then we will review the so-called collisional alignment, a molecular polarization phenomenon occurring in supersonic expansions of gaseous mixtures. The key feature, in this case, is the velocity dependence of the alignment degree, which allows the use of mechanical devices to filter out of the beam the molecules having either a random (statistical) or a preferential (non-statistical) spatial distribution of their rotational angular momentum J with respect to the molecular beam axis. The physical mechanisms underlying the collisional alignment will be resumed and some relevant gas-phase experiments demonstrating its occurrence will be illustrated. Application of such methodologies to the investigation of the stereodynamics of elementary processes occurring in gas-surface interaction will be presented and discussed for both weakly and strongly interacting systems.},

The collision dynamics is studied by a semiclassical method. The focus has been on behaviour of molecules initially in low-medium lying roto-vibrational states, for which, under the assumed conditions, initial vibrational state is in general preserved during the collision. For the rotational relaxation, some selectivities in the final state formation have been characterized. They are emerging especially at low collision energies, where the scattering is manly driven by the attractive forces controlling the physical adsorption. The rotational and vibrational accommodation coefficients have been evaluated and found to be in agreement with those reported in literature.},

Molecular beam experiments confirm that this is the case for He-CF4 , Ne-CF4 adducts, but revealed that the interaction of He and Ne with CCl4 features an appreciable contribution of chemical components that arise from the anisotropy of the electron density of CCl4 that enhances a charge transfer from Ng (Ng=He, Ne). These findings furnish a novel assay of the bonding capabilities of helium and neon, and invite to revisit the neutral complexes of these elements as systems of chemical relevance. The CCl4 -Ng are also peculiar examples of halogen bonds, a group of interactions of major current concern.

 abstract = { Weakly interacting molecules leading to collisional complexes, and to either stable or metastable dimers, potentially play an important role in molecular and surface physics, in astrophysics, in atmospheric photochemistry and physics, and climate. Accurate intermolecular potential energy surfaces for the major components of the atmosphere, leading to the characterization of the O 2 ‐O 2 , N 2 ‐N 2 and N 2 ‐O 2 dimers, have been obtained from the analysis of scattering experiments from our laboratory, also exploiting where available second virial coefficient data. A spherical harmonic expansion functional form describes the geometries of the dimers and accounts for the relative contributions to the intermolecular interaction from components of different nature. For O 2 ‐O 2 , singlet, triplet and quintet surfaces are obtained accounting for the role of spin‐spin coupling. The new surfaces allow the full characterization of structure and internal dynamics of the clusters, whose bound states and eigenfunctions are obtained by exact quantum mechanics. Besides the information on the nature of the bond, these results can be of use in modelling the role of dimers in air and the calculated rotovibrational levels provide a guidance for the analysis of spectra, thus establishing the ground for atmospheric monitorings. Reference is also briefly made to recent insight on the role of water. },

 abstract = {In this paper we illustrate an approach to the study of the molecular collision dynamics, suited for massive calculations of vibrational state-specific collision cross sections and rate constants of elementary gas phase processes involving carbon oxides. These data are used in the theoretical modeling of the Earth and planetary atmospheres and of non-equilibrium reactive gas flows containing the CO2 and CO molecules. The approach is based on classical trajectory simulations of the collision dynamics and on the bond-bond semi-empirical description of the intermolecular interaction potential, that allows the formulation of full dimension potential energy surfaces (the main input of simulations) for small and medium size systems. The bond-bond potential energy surfaces account for the dependence of the intermolecular interaction on some basic physical properties of the colliding partners, including modulations induced by the monomer deformation. The approach has been incorporated into a Grid empowered simulator able to handle the modeling of the CO2 + CO2 collisions, while extensions to other processes relevant for the modeling of gaseous flows and atmospheres, such as CO + CO → C + CO2 and CO2 + N2, are object of current work. Here the case of CO2 + CO2 collisions will be illustrated in detail to exemplify an application of the method.},

 abstract = {We report here experimental results on the magnetic analysis of velocity-selected molecular beams of oxygen using mass spectrometric detection. The experimental configuration allows us to establish a connection between the transmittance of the beam as a function of magnetic field intensities and the rotational distribution of the molecules. It is found that rotational temperatures can be usefully defined to describe distributions of the rotational angular momentum of an O2 molecule when beams are moderately supersonic (non-statistical behavior and alignment effects occurring under the extreme cooling conditions of highly supersonic expansions are considered elsewhere [38]). Most results can be explained assuming adiabatic adjustment of effective magnetic moments as molecules enter the magnetic field, but evidence is put forward that nonadiabatic effects can be of importance for sudden passages at high velocities and fields. The technique is also shown to be of use for diagnostic purposes in the specific case that the nearly effusive beam is heated under microwave discharge leading to an estimate of the role of metastable molecular states produced under such conditions.},

 abstract = {We report the definitive assessment of a measurable (half a kJ/mol) charge-transfer (CT) component in the interaction of water with the noble gases. The CT is found to be strongly stereoselective and is mediated by a highly asymmetric, donor/acceptor concerted role of the two hydrogen atoms, which can in fact dictate the equilibrium geometry of the adducts. This finding may be of general relevance in explaining the known peculiar orientational features of water's interactions. By using an original method of partial integration of the change in electron density occurring upon the formation of Ng-water complexes (computed with accurate ab initio methods and basis sets), we map the local charge displacement along the whole intermolecular region and are thus able to appraise CT effects free of the inherent ambiguity of charge decomposition models. With this, it was possible to prove that a small CT (of the order of a couple of millielectrons at most) takes place from Ng to water. Most importantly, this CT correlates quantitatively with some unexpected "glory" quantum interference effects observed in high-resolution molecular-beam Ng-water scattering experiments that indicate a stronger bond than a pure van der Waals force. The energy stabilization associated with the observed CT does not exceed half a kJ mol(-1). The Ng-water CT is found to be strongly stereoselective and is mediated by a highly asymmetric, donor-acceptor concerted role of the two hydrogen atoms, which can in fact dictate the equilibrium geometry of the adducts.

 abstract = {The two-body dissociation reactions of the dication C2H2+2, initiated via double ionization of acetylene molecules by photons in the energy range 31.9-50.0 eV, have been studied by coupling photoelectron-photoion-photoion coincidence and ion imaging techniques. The angular distributions and kinetic energy of product ions, measured in the 31.9-50.0 eV energy range, exhibit significant differences for the three leading dissociation reactions with respect to a previous investigation carried out at a fixed energy of 39.0 eV, providing thus new information on the dynamical evolution of the system. The analysis of the results indicates that such dissociation reactions occur with a different mechanism. In particular, the symmetric dissociation in two CH+ ions is characterized by different dynamics, and the anisotropy of the angular distribution of ionic products increases with photon energy in a more pronounced way than the other two reactions. Moreover, the kinetic energy distribution of the symmetric dissociation reaction exhibits several components that change with photon energy. The new experimental findings cast light on the microscopic evolution of the system and can provide a laboratory reference for new theoretical calculations on specific features of the multidimensional potential energy surface, namely, the structure, energy and symmetry of dication states, the electronic state of dissociation products, energy barriers and their dependence on the geometry of the intermediate state.},

 abstract = {Various effective components of the intermolecular interaction of water containing aggregates are examined and their modeling, in terms of the fundamental physical properties of the involved partners, is discussed. We focus, in particular, on the evolution of these components in going from the simplest neutral rare gas–water aggregates to bulk water and ionic water solutions. The analysis singled out that the model chosen to represent the van der Waals interaction as the composition of the action of three dispersion/induction–attraction centres and found to be appropriate to describe the lighter He–H2O and Ne–H2O systems, is not adequate to describe the heavier Ar–H2O aggregate. It was found, instead, that by increasing the mass of the rare gas, other short range contributions to the interaction come into play. Moreover, it was also found that the water molecule tends to behave as a single centre as the strength of the interaction increases. This led to the development of an effective model potential suitable to describe water clusters in the range going from gaseous to condensed phase.

In this paper we study the H2O2-Ng (Ng=He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe) systems providing the radial and the angular dependence of the potential energy surface on the relative position of the Ng atom. We accomplish this by introducing an analytical representation which is able to fit the ab initio energies of these complexes in a wide range of geometries. Our analysis sheds light on the role that the enantiomeric forms and the symmetry of the H2O2 molecule play on the resulting barriers and equilibrium geometries. The proposed theoretical framework is useful to study the dynamics of the H2O2 molecule, or other systems involving O-O and S-S bonds, interacting by non-covalent forces with atoms or molecules and to understand how the relative orientation of the O-H bonds changes along collisional events that may lead to a hydrogen bond formation or even to selectivity in chemical reactions. },

Our goal is to provide relevant tools to researchers working on kinetic models of atmospheric interest, in order to include Penning ionizations in their calculations as fast processes promoting reactions that cannot be neglected. Ions are extremely important for the transmission of radio and satellite signals, and they govern the chemistry of planetary ionospheres. Molecular ions have also been detected in comet tails. In this paper recent experimental results concerning production of simple ionic species of atmospheric interest are presented and discussed. Such results concern the formation of free ions in collisional ionization of H2O, H2S, and NH3 induced by highly excited species (Penning ionization) as metastable noble gas atoms. The effect of Penning ionization still has not been considered in the modeling of terrestrial and extraterrestrial objects so far, even, though metastable helium is formed by radiative recombination of He+ ions with electrons. Because helium is the second most abundant element of the universe, Penning ionization of atomic or molecular species by He*(23S1) is plausibly an active route of ionization in relatively dense environments exposed to cosmic rays.},

 abstract = {The present article provides an account of recent progress in the use of quantum mechanical tools for understanding structure and processes for systems of relevance in atmospheric chemistry. The focus is on problems triggered by experimental activity in this laboratory on investigations of intermolecular interactions by molecular beam scattering. Regarding the major components of the atmosphere, results are summarized on dimers (N2–N2, O2–O2, N2–O2) where experimental and phenomenogically derived potential energy surfaces have been used to compute quantum mechanically the intermolecular clusters dynamics. Rovibrational levels and wave functions are obtained, for perspective use in atmospheric modelling, specifically of radiative absorption of weakly bound complexes. Further work has involved interactions of paramount importance, those of water, for which state-of-the-art quantum chemical calculations for its complexes with rare gases yield complementary information on the interaction (specifically the anisotropies) with respect to molecular beam scattering experiments that measure essentially the isotropic forces. Similar approaches and results have been pursued and obtained for H2S. Stimulated in part by the interesting problem of large amplitude vibrations, such as the chirality change transitions associated with the torsional motions around OO and SS bonds, a systematic series of quantum chemical studies has been undertaken on systems that play also roles in the photochemistry of the minor components of the atmosphere. They are H2O2, H2S2 and several molecules obtained by substitutions of the hydrogens by alkyl groups or halogens. Quantum chemistry is shown to have reached the stage of resolving many previously controversial features regarding these series of molecules (dipole moment, equilibrium geometries, heights of barriers for torsion), which are crucial for intramolecular dynamics. Quantum dynamics calculations are also performed to compute torsional levels and the temperature dependence of their distributions.},

The potential energy surfaces used were previously shown to account qualitatively for the experimental findings. The present calculations are aimed at an explanation of the branching ratios between the vibrational levels of the N2(B) product as previously measured at several collision energies. The collisions are treated as sudden with respect to molecular rotation and the reaction is assumed to be adiabatic on vibronic states. Those crossings between entrance and exit channels which are responsible for the nonadiabatic transitions are identified by symmetry analysis and numerical experiments, using the Landau-Zener theory. Information on the strength and radial dependence of the relevant coupling matrix element is obtained. The separability between vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom is discussed. In certain cases the nonadiabatic transitions are so fast that molecular rearrangement can be neglected (sudden behaviour), while in other cases they are slower than vibrations (adiabatic behaviour). In the sudden limit the Franck-Condon factors between the N2(X) and N2(B) vibrational wavefunctions have to be taken into account, but in the adiabatic limit they are unimportant.},

 abstract = {Molecular beam scattering experiments have been performed to study the effect of long-range anisotropic forces on the collision dynamics of two small polar molecules. The main focus of this paper is on water, but also ammonia and hydrogen sulphide molecules have been investigated, and some results will be anticipated. The intermolecular distances mainly probed are of the order of 1 nm and therefore much larger than the molecular dimensions. In particular, we have found that the natural electric field gradient, generated by different spatial orientations of the permanent electric dipoles, is able to promote the transformation of free rotations into coupled pendular states, letting the molecular partners involved in the collision complex swinging to and fro around the field direction. This long-ranged concerted motion manifested itself as large increases of the magnitude of the total integral cross section. The experimental findings and the theoretical treatment developed to shed light on the details of the process suggest that the transformation from free rotations to pendular states depends on the rotational level of both molecules, on the impact parameter, on the relative collision velocity, on the dipole moment product and occurs in the time scale of picoseconds. The consequences of this intriguing phenomenon may be important for the interpretation and, in perspective, for the control of elementary chemical and biological processes, given by polar molecules, ions, and free radicals, occurring in several environments under various conditions. },

An extension to ion-ion systems is also presented, on the basis of an empirical analysis of available data on alkali halides, in order to establish the role of both dispersion and induction interactions as compared to Coulomb attraction. An improved version of the Slater-Kirkwood formulation with an appropriate choice for the effective electron numbers is suggested to estimate the long range effective dispersion coefficients. The present approach provides a unifying framework for the characterization of bonds for systems which greatly vary in size and strength and recipes are suggested for interatomic potential energy curves. It is concluded that this approach is also relevant as a starting point for extensions to include anisotropies due both to orbital overlap for open shell partners and to mutual orientation when molecules are considered.},

The pure electrostatic contribution accounts for the quadrupole–dipole interaction and the remaining ones are represented as a combination of effective potential terms, containing one non directly transferable and two transferable parameters. The first one introduces a high flexibility to the potential function and the last ones, well depth and distance at the minimum associated to the different interaction pairs, have a defined physical meaning and are derived by exploiting the decomposability of molecular polarizabilities (without performing any fit). For a given decomposition, the transferable parameters are assumed to have an universal character and, thanks to the flexibility of the function, they may be used to describe the same system in different environments, even when the charge distribution varies. Predicted results for the C6H6–H2O dimer are compared with ab initio calculations. The behavior of benzene solvated by several water molecules is investigated by performing molecular dynamics simulations and the results are relevant to define some basic features of the main solvation shells.},

 abstract = {Ions in space are formed in various ways, the relevance of which depends on the specific conditions of the considered extraterrestrial environment. The interaction of neutral molecules with cosmic rays, UV photons, X-rays and other phenomena such as shock waves are all important processes for their production. Once formed, ions are able to drive some chemistry that leads to molecular ions and, via dissociative recombination, molecules of increasing complexity. Therefore, ion-chemistry plays a pivotal role in the chemistry of the interstellar medium and upper planetary atmospheres (ionospheres). Molecular ions have also been detected in comet tails. In this paper, we briefly review experimental results obtained in our laboratory and concerning the formation of free ions in two different types of processes: double photoionization and collisional ionization induced by highly excited species (Penning ionization). A detailed characterization of these processes in laboratory experiments is of crucial importance to understand the chemistry of extraterrestrial environments. The double photoionization occurs when high energy photons are available and, as dications are generally metastable and rapidly decay into two fragment ions, contributes to the global budget of ion formation. The effects of Penning ionization have never been considered in modeling extraterrestrial objects so far, even though metastable helium is known to be formed by radiative recombination of He+ ions with electrons. Because helium is the second most abundant element of the Universe, Penning ionization of molecules by He*(23S1) is plausibly an active route of ionization in relatively dense environments exposed to cosmic rays.},

 abstract = {New molecular beam scattering experiments have been performed to measure the total (elastic plus inelastic) cross sections as a function of the velocity in collisions between water and hydrogen sulfide projectile molecules and the methane target. Measured data have been exploited to characterize the range and strength of the intermolecular interaction in such systems, which are of relevance as they drive the gas phase molecular dynamics and the clathrate formation. Complementary information has been obtained by rotational spectra, recorded for the hydrogen sulfide-methane complex, with a pulsed nozzle Fourier transform microwave spectrometer. Extensive ab initio calculations have been performed to rationalize all the experimental findings. The combination of experimental and theoretical information has established the ground for the understanding of the nature of the interaction and allows for its basic components to be modelled, including charge transfer, in these weakly bound systems. The intermolecular potential for H2S-CH4 is significantly less anisotropic than for H2O-CH4, although both of them have potential minima that can be characterized as 'hydrogen bonded'. },

A model coupling potential is then derived in order to include target vibrational motion during encounters with both projectiles at intermediate collision energies. An extensive close-coupling calculation for individual state-to-state integral cross sections was thus carried out over the whole range of vibrational excitation and/or de-excitation (V,T) processes which involved single and multiple quantum jumps between target vibrational levels. The corresponding rate constants were finally obtained and compared with available experiments.

 abstract = {THE orientational dependence of molecular interactions has long been recognized as central to an understanding of reaction mechanisms and of collisions in the gas phase and at surfaces. Studies of orientation effects have recently become possible owing to the development of techniques for aligning molecules. 'Brute-force' methods using electric or magnetic fields can induce alignment of molecules with dipole moments1,2, and polarized-absorption approaches3 can be used in cases where there are suitable molecular transitions; but one of the simplest and most general methods involves the supersonic expansion of molecular beams seeded with molecules that induce rotational alignment—selection of specific rotational states—by collisions4–12. Here we use such an approach to induce strong rotational alignment of oxygen molecules in a beam seeded with various other gases at close to atmospheric pressure. Most significantly, we find that the degree of alignment depends on the velocity of the molecules in the supersonic expansion—fast molecules are much more highly aligned than slower ones, and the velocity of maximum alignment can be altered by changing the gas mixture. In this way, we can prepare rotationally aligned molecules with well defined velocities, opening up new possibilities for experiments in molecular dynamics.},

In the case of N2O, for the two possible dissociative processes leading to N++NO+ and O++N2+, anisotropic angular distributions of ionic fragments have been measured, indicating that N2O ionizes when its axis is parallel to the light polarization vector and the fragments are separating in a time shorter than the dication rotational period. In the case of C2H2, the two-body dissociation reactions producing C2H++H+ and CH2++C+ have shown almost isotropic angular distributions, indicating the double photoionization occurs when acetylene is mainly oriented perpendicularly to the light polarization vector. The analysis of results based on a Monte Carlo trajectory simulation provides: i) the metastable N2O2+ and C2H22+ dication lifetimes, ii) the kinetic energy release (KER) distribution for the final ions resulting from the Coulomb explosion, and iii) the anisotropy β parameter values as a function of the investigated photon energy extracted from the measured ionic angular distributions.},

The integral cross section, Q, has been measured for both collisional systems in the thermal energy range and oscillations due to the quantum "glory" interference have been resolved in the velocity dependence of Q. The analysis of the measured Q(v) data provided novel information on the anisotropic potential energy surfaces of the studied systems at intermediate and large separation distances. The relative role of the most relevant types of contributions to the global interaction has been characterized. Extending the phenomenology of a weak intermolecular halogen bond, the present work demonstrates that while D<sub>2</sub> - CF<sub>4</sub> is basically bound through the balance between size (Pauli) repulsion and dispersion attraction, an appreciable intermolecular bond stabilization by charge transfer is operative in D<sub>2</sub> - CCl<sub>4</sub>. We also demonstrated that the present analysis is consistent with that carried out for the F(<sup>2</sup>P)-D<sub>2</sub> and Cl(<sup>2</sup>P)-D<sub>2</sub> systems, previously characterized by scattering experiments performed with state-selected halogen atom beams. A detailed comparison of the present and previous results on O<sub>2</sub>-CF<sub>4</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>-CCl<sub>4</sub> systems pinpointed striking differences in the behavior of hydrogen and oxygen molecules when they interact with the same partner, mainly due to the selectivity of the charge transfer component. The present work contributes to cast light on the nature and role of the intermolecular interaction in prototype systems, involving homo-nuclear diatoms and symmetric halogenated molecules.},

 abstract = {Dissociative double photoionization of CO(2), producing CO(+) and O(+) ions, has been studied in the 36-49 eV energy range using synchrotron radiation and ion-ion coincidence imaging detection. At low energy, the reaction appears to occur by an indirect mechanism through the formation of CO(+) and an autoionizing state of the oxygen atom. In this energy range the reaction leads to an isotropic distribution of products with respect to the polarization vector of the light. When the photon energy increases, the distribution of products becomes anisotropic, with the two ions preferentially emitted along the direction of the light polarization vector. This implies that the molecule photoionizes when oriented parallel to that direction and also that the CO(2)(2+) dication just formed dissociates in a time shorter than its typical rotational period. At low photon energy, the CO(+) and O(+) product ions separate predominantly with a total kinetic energy between 3 and 4 eV. This mechanism becomes gradually less important when the photon energy increases and, at 49 eV, a process where the two products separate with a kinetic energy between 5 and 6 eV is dominant.},

 abstract = {The small LiI-(CH3CN)1–10 clusters and acetonitrile solutions of lithium iodide have been investigated by performing extensive Molecular Dynamics simulations at different conditions. The formulation of the involved force field represents in a proper way both energetics and structure of the systems. The smallest LiI–CH3CN aggregate has been also characterized from a static point of view, by considering different approaches of LiI to CH3CN and the comparison between static and dynamics results has proved that the binding energies can be satisfactorily estimated from Molecular Dynamics simulations by extrapolating to 0K the values of the mean potential energy obtained at different temperatures. For several structures, namely the LiI-(CH3CN)4–8,10 aggregates, more than one isomer has been detected.The acetonitrile solutions of lithium iodide have been studied in the 0.030moldm−3–0.887moldm−3 concentration range, by adding 1, 5, 10, 20 and 27 molecules of LiI to an ensemble of 675 molecules of solvent. Each solution has been investigated at temperatures ranging from 250K to 350K. It has been observed that the addition of the LiI salt to acetonitrile results in a volumetric contraction that originates changes in the structure of the solvent. Moreover, it has been observed that, except for solutions containing only one LiI molecule, the salt molecules tend to dissociate, thus allowing the formation of well-defined solvation shells around the ions. All these findings are representatives of a coupled dynamics of solute and solvent molecules controlling simultaneously the formation of the solvation shells and the salt dissociation.},

 abstract = {Scattering data, measured for rare gas-rare gas systems under high angular and energy resolution conditions, have been used to probe the reliability of a recently proposed interaction potential function, which involves only one additional parameter with respect to the venerable Lennard-Jones (LJ) model and is hence called Improved Lennard-Jones (ILJ). The ILJ potential eliminates most of the inadequacies at short- and long-range of the LJ model. Further reliability tests have been performed by comparing calculated vibrational spacings with experimental values and calculated interaction energies at short-range with those obtained from the inversion of gaseous transport properties. The analysis, extended also to systems involving ions, suggests that the ILJ potential model can be used to estimate the behavior of unknown systems and can help to assess the different role of the leading interaction components. Moreover, due to its simple formulation, the physically reliable ILJ model appears to be particularly useful for molecular dynamics simulations of both neutral and ionic systems.},

 abstract = {In this work, we exploit a new formulation of the potential energy and of the related computational procedures, which embodies the coupling between the intra and intermolecular components, to characterize possible propensities of the collision dynamics in energy transfer processes of interest for simulation and control of phenomena occurring in a variety of equilibrium and nonequilibrium environments. The investigation reported in the paper focuses on the prototype CO2 -N2 system, whose intramolecular component of the interaction is modeled in terms of a many body expansion while the intermolecular component is modeled in terms of a recently developed bonds-as-interacting-molecular-centers' approach. The main advantage of this formulation of the potential energy surface is that of being (a) truly full dimensional (i.e., all the variations of the coordinates associated with the molecular vibrations and rotations on the geometrical and electronic structure of the monomers, are explicitly taken into account without freezing any bonds or angles), (b) more flexible than other usual formulations of the interaction and (c) well suited for fitting procedures better adhering to accurate ab initio data and sensitive to experimental arrangement dependent information. Specific attention has been given to the fact that a variation of vibrational and rotational energy has a higher (both qualitative and quantitative) impact on the energy transfer when a more accurate formulation of the intermolecular interaction (with respect to that obtained when using rigid monomers) is adopted. This makes the potential energy surface better suited for the kinetic modeling of gaseous mixtures in plasma, combustion and atmospheric chemistry computational applications. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The potential energy driving the system in the relevant configurations of the entrance and exit channels, used in the spectrum simulation, has been formulated by the use of a semi-empirical method.

 abstract = {We report on stereodynamical effects in heterogeneous catalytic reactions as measured by molecular beam-surface experiments. Specifically for CO oxidation on Pd(100) we find that the rotational alignment of the incoming O2 at low (Θ = 0.04 ML) and at intermediate (ΘCO = 0.17 ML) CO pre-coverage, causes a higher reactivity of molecules in high and in low helicity states, respectively (corresponding to helicoptering and cartwheeling motion of O2). In first approximation, at low CO pre-coverage the difference in reactivity is determined by the different location of the O atoms generated in the dissociation process by the different parent molecules, while at intermediate CO pre-coverage the reactivity is influenced also by the different ability of cartwheeling and helicoptering O2 to penetrate through the CO adlayer. In accord with this the total amount of CO2 produced is always largest for helicopters which generate supersurface O atoms at least in the low CO pre-coverage limit. A deeper inspection of the data indicates, however, that the dynamics is more complex, two different pathways being present for the reaction with O generated by helicopters and one for O generated by cartwheels. Moreover, cartwheels generated oxygen influences the reactivity of subsequently arriving helicopters.},

 abstract = {The systems studied in this work are gas-phase weakly bound adducts of the noble-gas (Ng) atoms with CCl4 and CF4. Their investigation was motivated by the widespread current interest for the intermolecular halogen bonding (XB), a structural motif recognized to play a role in fields ranging from elementary processes to biochemistry. The simulation of the static and dynamic behaviors of complex systems featuring XB requires the formulation of reliable and accurate model potentials, whose development relies on the detailed characterization of strength and nature of the interactions occurring in simple exemplary halogenated systems. We thus selected the prototypical Ng-CCl4 and Ng-CF4 and performed high-resolution molecular beam scattering experiments to measure the absolute scale of their intermolecular potentials, with high sensitivity. In general, we expected to probe typical van der Waals interactions, consisting of a combination of size (exchange) repulsion with dispersion/induction attraction. For the He/Ne-CF4, the analysis of the glory quantum interference pattern, observable in the velocity dependence of the integral cross section, confirmed indeed this expectation. On the other hand, for the He/Ne/Ar-CCl4, the scattering data unravelled much deeper potential wells, particularly for certain configurations of the interacting partners. The experimental data can be properly reproduced only including a shifting of the repulsive wall at shorter distances, accompanied by an increased role of the dispersion attraction, and an additional short-range stabilization component. To put these findings on a firmer ground, we performed, for selected geometries of the interacting complexes, accurate theoretical calculations aimed to evaluate the intermolecular interaction and the effects of the complex formation on the electron charge density of the constituting moieties. It was thus ascertained that the adjustments of the potential suggested by the analysis of the experiments actually reflect two chemically meaningful contributions, namely, a stabilizing interaction arising from the anisotropy of the charge distribution around the Cl atom in CCl4 and a stereospecific electron transfer that occurs at the intermolecular distances mainly probed by the experiments. Our model calculations suggest that the largest effect is for the vertex geometry of CCl4 while other geometries appear to play a minor to negligible role. },

The data can therefore be treated in terms of a central force-field assumption. The validity of this assumption is confirmed by comparison with the behaviour of other systems through a correlation between the potential parameters and the polarizabilities.},

 abstract = {Focus in the present paper is on the analysis of total and partial ionization cross sections, measured in absolute value as a function of the collision energy, representative of the probability of ionic product formation in selected electronic states in Ne*-H2 O, H2 S, and NH3 collisions. In order to characterize the imaginary part of the optical potential, related to electronic couplings, we generalize a methodology to obtain direct information on the opacity function of these reactions. Such a methodology has been recently exploited to test the real part of the optical potential (S. Falcinelli et al., Chem. Eur. J., 2016, 22, 764-771). Depending on the balance of noncovalent contributions, the real part controls the approach of neutral reactants, the removal of ionic products, and the structure of the transition state. Strength, range, and stereoselectivity of electronic couplings, triggering these and many other reactions, are directly obtained from the present investigation. },

 abstract = {Total integral cross section experiments, for collisions of rotationally hot H2S projectile molecules by He and Xe targets, have been performed in the thermal energy range by using a molecular beam apparatus, which operates under high resolution conditions and exploits a quadrupole mass spectrometer as a detector. Information on the radial dependence of the intermolecular interaction, averaged over all relative orientations of colliding partners, is obtained. This study completes the investigation of H2S–rare gas family [see D. Cappelletti, A.F.A. Vilela, P.R.P. Barreto, R. Gargano, F. Pirani, V. Aquilanti, J. Chem. Phys. 125 (2006) 133111, for Ne, Ar and Kr] and permits us to discover similarities and differences with the analogous H2O–Rg series of systems. In particular, the analysis of the scattering data suggests that while the complexes of H2S–rare gases from He to Kr are essentially bound by nearly isotropic noncovalent interactions of van der Waals type, the H2S–Xe system exhibits a weak, but measurable, additional component which emerges at intermediate intermolecular distance (in proximity of the potential well), and provides a bond stabilization. This observation is of possible interest for the investigation of the phenomenology of the hydrogen bond formation.},

 abstract = {The three low-lying potential energy surfaces in the O2–O2 dimer, describing the dependence of the interaction on the intermolecular distance and on the relative molecular orientation, had been accurately characterized from the analysis of scattering experiments carried out by using polarized O2 beams, generated and selected under angular and velocity resolution conditions suitable to measure quantum interference effects in the velocity dependence of the integral cross sections. Most of the bonding in the dimer was found to come from van der Waals forces, but in this open shell-open shell system chemical (spin–spin) contributions, to the ground state interaction at the equilibrium, are 15%. This complete characterization of the potential energy surfaces, of interest also for the theory of weak chemical bond and crucial to define structure, dynamics and spectroscopic features of the complex, is exploited in this paper to calculate the bound rotovibrational states for the O2–O2 dimer for J6 by solving a secular problem over the exact Hamiltonian, considering O2 monomers as rigid rotors, and where the Coriolis coupling is included, allowing the assessment of the limits of the centrifugal sudden approximations. The results of this study are of relevance for the analysis of spectra and the description of characteristic internal motions for this prototypical weakly bound molecular complex.},

 abstract = {The benzene-benzene (Bz-Bz) interaction is present in several chemical systems and it is known to be crucial in understanding the specificity of important biological phenomena. In this work, we propose a novel Bz-Bz analytical potential energy surface which is fine-tuned on accurate ab initio calculations in order to improve its reliability. Once the Bz-Bz interaction is modeled, an analytical function for the energy of the Bzn clusters may be obtained by summing up over all pair potentials. We apply an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to discover the lowest-energy structures of Bzn clusters (for n=2-25), and the results are compared with previous global optimization studies where different potential functions were employed. Besides the global minimum, the EA also gives the structures of other low-lying isomers ranked by the corresponding energy. Additional ab initio calculations are carried out for the low-lying isomers of Bz3 and Bz4 clusters, and the global minimum is confirmed as the most stable structure for both sizes. Finally, a detailed analysis of the low-energy isomers of the n = 13 and 19 magic-number clusters is performed. The two lowest-energy Bz13 isomers show S6 and C3 symmetry, respectively, which is compatible with the experimental results available in the literature. The Bz19 structures reported here are all non-symmetric, showing two central Bz molecules surrounded by 12 nearest-neighbor monomers in the case of the five lowest-energy structures.},

Experimental determinations of the Kinetic Energy Released (KER) for ions originating from dissociations reactions, induced by Coulomb explosion of doubly charged molecular ions (molecular dications) produced by double photoionization of CO2, N2O and C2H2 molecules of interest in planetary atmospheres, are reported. The KER measurement as a function of the ultraviolet (UV) photon energy in the range of 28–65 eV was extracted from the electron-ion-ion coincidence spectra obtained by using tunable synchrotron radiation coupled with ion imaging techniques at the ELETTRA Synchrotron Light Laboratory Trieste, Italy. These experiments, coupled with a computational analysis based on a Monte Carlo trajectory simulation, allow assessing the probability of escape for simple ionic species in the upper atmosphere of Mars, Venus and Titan. The measured KER in the case of H+, C+, CH+, CH2+, N+, O+, CO+, N2+ and NO+ fragment ions range between 1.0 and 5.5 eV, being large enough to allow these ionic species to participate in the atmospheric escape from such planets into space.

The basic idea exploits the concept of bond polarizability additivity to represent both the molecular repulsion, in terms of a size which is mainly ascribed to the molecular bonds nearest to the probe atom, and the molecular attraction as due to multi-dispersion centers delocalized on the molecular frame.

 abstract = {This article gives a perspective view of some representative experimental information available on interatomic forces. They play a role in gaseous properties, but modern quantitative information comes from spectroscopy and molecular beam scattering. This latter technique is emphasized here: recent experimental results and consideration of physical properties of interacting species is complementary to progress of modelling based on ab initio or other quantum chemical calculations. Interactions involved in closed-shell–closed-shell species are considered to be typical of the so-called ‘non-covalent’ forces, although additional effects of a ‘chemical’ nature are demonstrated to be non-negligible in some cases. The partition of the interaction into van der Waals (repulsion + dispersion) and possibly electrostatic and/or induction components is analysed. Interactions involving open-shell species offer a most interesting phenomenology, because electronic anisotropy often provides further strength to the bonds, which are usually weaker than ordinary chemical bonds. Again, the focus is on experimental information (especially on scattering of magnetically analysed open-shell atoms) and on the understanding that comes from the analysis of the ample phenomenology accumulated. Additional terms such as those of specific ‘covalent’ nature appear in the partition of the interaction, besides those already mentioned. The extension of this approach for describing molecular anisotropies is also outlined.},

 abstract = {A recently introduced bond-bond formulation of the intermolecular interaction has been extended to six-atom systems to the end of assembling a new potential energy surface (PES) and has been incorporated into a grid empowered simulator able to handle the modeling of the CO(2) + CO(2) processes. The proposed PES is full dimensional and accounts for the dependence of the intermolecular interaction on some basic physical properties of the colliding partners, including modulations induced by the monomer deformation. The used analytical formulation of the interaction involves a limited number of parameters, each having a clear physical meaning. Guess values for these parameters can also be obtained from analytical correlation formulae. Such estimates can then be fine tuned by exploiting experimental and theoretical information. The resulting PES well describes stretched and bent asymptotic CO(2) monomers as well as the CO(2)-CO(2) interaction in the most and less stable configurations. On this potential massive quasiclassical elastic and inelastic detailed scattering trajectories have been integrated, by exploiting the innovative computational technologies of the grid. The efficiency of the approach used and the reliability of the estimates of the dynamical properties obtained in this way is such that we can now plan a systematic evaluation of the state specific rate coefficient matrix elements needed for space craft reentry modeling. Here, we present probabilities and cross sections useful to rationalize some typical mechanisms characterizing the vibrational transitions of the CO(2) + CO(2) system on the flexible monomer proposed PES. On such PES, the key dynamical outcomes are: (a) there is a strong energy interchange between symmetric stretching of the reactants and bending of the products (and viceversa) while asymmetric stretching is strongly adiabatic (b) reactant energy is more efficiently allocated (with respect to the rigid monomers PES) as product vibration when reactant stretching modes are excited while the contrary is true when the reactant bending mode is excited.},

 abstract = {A new force field for the intermolecular H2S-H2S interaction has been used to study the most relevant properties of the hydrogen sulfide system from gaseous to liquid phases by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In order to check the validity of the interaction formulation, ab initio CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ calculations, including the counterpoise correction on the H2S, (H2S)2, and (H2S)3 structures optimized at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level, have been performed. The (H2S)2,3 systems have been characterized by performing NVE MD simulations at decreasing values of the temperature, while the liquid sulfide behavior has been investigated considering a NpT ensemble of 512 molecules at several thermodynamic states, defined by different pressure and temperature values. Additional calculations using an ensemble of 2197 molecules at two different temperatures have been performed to investigate the liquid/vapor interface of the system. The S-S, S-H, and H-H radial distribution functions and the coordination number, calculated at the same conditions used in X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments, and the evaluated thermodynamic and structural properties have been compared successfully with experimental data, thus confirming the reliability of the force field formulation and of the MD predictions. },

These sets of data, obtained under the same experimental conditions, are relevant to identify differences in the autoionization stereodynamics of the three hydrogenated molecules and on the selective role of the imaginary part of the optical potential. We demonstrate that in these autoionization processes hydrogen and halogen bonds are competing because they are controlling both real and imaginary components of the optical potential that drives the complete reaction dynamics. In particular, we found that both components critically depend on the angular and radial approach between the reagent partners in determining the collision dynamics. },

 abstract = {Gas phase collisions of O2 by CH4, CF4, and CCl4 have been investigated with the molecular beam technique by measuring both the integral cross section value, Q, and its dependence on the collision velocity, v. The adopted experimental conditions have been appropriate to resolve the oscillating "glory" pattern, a quantum interference effect controlled by the features of the intermolecular interaction, for all the three case studies. The analysis of the Q(v) data, performed by adopting a suitable representation of the intermolecular potential function, provided the basic features of the anisotropic potential energy surfaces at intermediate and large separation distances and information on the relative role of the physically relevant types of contributions to the global interaction. The present work demonstrates that while O2-CH4 and O2-CF4 are basically bound through the balance between size (Pauli) repulsion and dispersion attraction, an appreaciable intermolecular bond stabilization by charge transfer is operative in O2-CCl4. Ab initio calculations of the strength of the interaction, coupled with detailed analysis of electronic charge displacement promoted by the formation of the dimer, fully rationalizes the experimental findings. This investigation indicates that the interactions of O2, when averaged over its relative orientations, are similar to that of a noble gas (Ng), specifically Ar. We also show that the binding energy in the basic configurations of the prototypical Ng-CF4,CCl4 systems [ Cappelletti , D. ; Chem. Eur. J. 2015 , 21 , 6234 - 6240 ] can be reconstructed by using the interactions in Ng-F and Ng-Cl systems, previously characterized by molecular beam scattering experiments of state-selected halogen atom beams. This information is fundamental to approach the modeling of the weak intermolecular halogen bond. On the basis of the electronic polarizability, this also confirms [ Aquilanti , V. ; Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2005 , 44 , 2356 - 2360 ] that O2 can be taken as a proper reference partner for simulating the behavior of some basic noncovalent components of the interactions involving water. Present results are of fundamental relevance to build up the force field controlling the hydrophobic behavior of prototypical apolar CX4 (X = H, F, Cl) molecules. },

 abstract = {An understanding of the interactions involving water and other small hydrogenated molecules such as H(2)S and NH(3) at the molecular level is an important and elusive scientific goal with potential implications for fields ranging from biochemistry to astrochemistry. One longstanding question about water's intermolecular interactions, and notably hydrogen bonding, is the extent and importance of charge transfer (CT) , which can have important implications for the development of reliable model potentials for water chemistry, among other applications. The weakly bound adducts, commonly regarded as pure van der Waals systems, formed by H(2)O, H(2)S, and NH(3) with noble gases or simple molecules such as H(2), provide an interesting case study for these interactions. Their binding energies are approximately 1 or 2 kJ/mol at most, and CT effects in these systems are thought to be negligible. Our laboratory has performed high-resolution molecular-beam scattering experiments that probe the (absolute scale) intermolecular potential of various types of these gas-phase binary complexes with extreme sensitivity. These experiments have yielded surprising and intriguing quantitative results. The key experimental measurable is the "glory" quantum interference shift that shows a systematic, anomalous energy stabilization for the water complexes and clearly points to a significant role for CT effects. To investigate these findings, we have performed very accurate theoretical calculations and devised a simple approach to study the electron displacement that accompanies gas-phase binary intermolecular interactions in extreme detail. These calculations are based on a partial progressive integration of the electron density changes. The results unambiguously show that water's intermolecular interactions are not typical van der Waals complexes. Instead, these interactions possess a definite, strongly stereospecific CT component, even when very weak, where a water molecule may act as electron donor or acceptor depending on its orientation. CT is mediated by an asymmetric role played by the two hydrogen atoms, which causes strong orientation effects. The careful comparison of these calculations with the experimental results shows that the stabilization energy associated to CT is approximately 2-3 eV per electron transferred and may make up for a large portion of the total interaction energy. A simple electron delocalization model helps to validate and explain these findings.},

 abstract = {Molecular beam scattering experiments are presented for the first time in order to characterize the nature and strength of the intermolecular interaction of the gas phase H2O–CF4 and H2O–CCl4 weakly bound complexes. Simultaneous measurements of the collision cross section of water, molecular oxygen, and argon atoms scattered by the same target (CF4 or CCl4) have been performed in the thermal energy range. The experimental results show unambiguously that H2O–CCl4 is ∼0.5 kJ/mol more stable than O2–CCl4 and Ar–CCl4, which is incompatible with a fully noncovalent nature of the interaction. Interestingly, this is not the case for the analogous CF4 complexes which all show the same binding energy, within the experimental uncertainty. These results are supported by state-of-the-art ab initio calculation of the dimer structures and of the charge displacement upon the formation of the complex. The focus is on the possible stabilization effects due to halogen bond formation and on the extent of the related charge transfer. The latter has been shown to be large from H2O toward CCl4 and negligible from H2O toward CF4.},

Their analysis demonstrates that the average attractive component of the water-H(2) intermolecular potential in the well region is about 30% stronger than dispersion and induction forces would imply. An extensive and detailed theoretical analysis of the electron charge displacement accompanying the interaction, over several crucial sections of the potential energy surface (PES), shows that water-H(2) interaction is accompanied by charge transfer (CT) and that the observed stabilization energy correlates quantitatively with CT magnitude at all distances. Based on the experimentally determined potential and the calculated CT, a general theoretical model is devised which reproduces very accurately PES sections obtained at the CCSD(T) level with large basis sets. The energy stabilization associated with CT is calculated to be 2.5 eV per electron transferred. Thus, CT is shown to be a significant, strongly stereospecific component of the interaction, with water functioning as electron donor or acceptor in different orientations. The general relevance of these findings for water's chemistry is discussed.},

The low collision energy (in the thermal and subthermal range) and the high angular resolution permit observation of the “glory” effect, manifestation of quantum-mechanical interference, which allows an accurate probe of intermolecular interactions. This first complete experimental characterization of the interaction yields a ground (singlet) state bond energy of 17.0 ± 0.8 meV for the most stable dimer geometry (the two oxygen molecules lying parallel at a distance of 3.56 ± 0.07 Å). Also the splittings among the singlet, the triplet, and the quintet surfaces are obtained, and a full representation of their angular dependence is reported via a novel harmonic expansion functional form for diatom−diatom interactions. These results indicate that most of the bonding in the dimer comes from van der Waals forces, but chemical (spin−spin) contributions in this open-shell/open-shell system are not negligible (∼15% of the van der Waals component of the interaction).},

The method is here applied to the investigation of the prototypical M(+)-C6H6 systems (M = Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs) and some of its predictions are tested against accurate ab initio calculations. Such calculations have been performed by employing the MP2 method and large basis sets, privileging the description of the metal atoms. The agreement between potential energy scans semiempirically obtained and ab initio results is good for all the investigated geometries, thus showing that the adopted representation is in general able to reproduce all the main features of the potential energy surface for these systems.

The ion-HFBz and ion-TFBz electrostatic components are formulated as a sum of Coulombic potentials associated with the interactions between the ion charge and point charges on the molecular frame, whose distributions are consistent with the permanent quadrupole moment of HFBz and TFBz, respectively. The corresponding nonelectrostatic components are represented as a sum of effective potential functions, each one having a specific physical meaning, related to ion-molecular bond pair interactions. In the present paper, we test the transferability of the ion-bond potential parameters. Moreover, the powerfulness of the model is analyzed by comparing predicted binding energies and equilibrium geometries for the family of M(+)-HFBz, X(-)-HFBz, M(+)-TFBz, and X(-)-TFBz systems with available ab initio results.},

 abstract = {The semiempirical methodology, introduced to describe noncovalent intermolecular interactions in atom/ion-molecule systems, is here extended to investigate a prototype cluster, formed by benzene (Bz) and closed-shell ions (Na(+) and/or Cl(-)), surrounded by neutral species (Ar), forming solvation shells. The involved multidimensional potential energy surface (PES) is assumed to depend on a critical balancing of some effective interaction components. In particular, for the Ar solvated Bz-Na(+)-Cl(-) system, the nonelectrostatic component of the total interaction has been formulated as a combination of two-, three-, and four-body contributions, each one represented by a proper function, with the four-body and part of the three-body terms arising from nonadditive induction effects. The proposed formulation, in which the induction is included both implicitly and explicitly, ensures the accurate description of all dissociation channels, leading to simpler clusters and/or pure solvent. Some properties of the solvent, represented by an ensemble of 500 Ar atoms, have been analyzed by performing molecular dynamics simulations at several temperatures. The obtained results have been found to be consistent with experimental observations. In order to investigate propensities, similarities, and differences in the competing clusters, the Ar solvation shells of Bz, Bz-Na(+), Bz-Cl(-) and Bz-Na(+)-Cl(-) have been characterized. The inspection of the solvation shell of Bz allows one to distinguish between groups of Ar atoms occupying positions on and out of the plane defined by the aromatic ring. Regarding the solvation shells of Bz-Na(+) and Bz-Cl(-), it has been observed that they are strongly affected by the most stable structures of the unsolvated systems. However, Bz-Na(+) shows more compact solvation shells than Bz-Cl(-). Finally, important asymmetries, basically promoted by the additional many-body induction effects on the solvent atoms, have been observed in the solvation shells of Bz-Na(+)-Cl(-).},

 abstract = {The effect of some leading intermolecular interaction components on specific features of weakly bound clusters involving an aromatic molecule, a closed shell ion, and Ar atoms is analyzed by performing molecular dynamics simulations on potential energy surfaces properly formulated in a consistent way. In particular, our investigation focuses on the three-dimensional Ar distributions around the K(+)-hexafluorobenzene (K(+)-HFBz) dimer, in K(+)-HFBz-Ar(n) aggregates (n ≤ 15), and on the gradual evolution from cluster rearrangement to solvation dynamics when ensembles of 50, 100, 200, and 500 Ar atoms are taken into account. Results indicate that the Ar atoms compete to be placed in such a way to favor an attractive interaction with both K(+) and HFBz, occupying positions above and below the aromatic plane but close to the cation. When these positions are already occupied, the Ar atoms tend to be placed behind the cation, at larger distances from the center of mass of HFBz. Accordingly, three different groups of Ar atoms are observed when increasing n, with two of them surrounding K(+), thus, disrupting the K(+)-HFBz equilibrium geometry and favoring the dissociation of the solvated cation when the temperature increases. The selective role of the leading intermolecular interaction components directly depending on the ion size repulsion is discussed in detail by analyzing similarities and differences on the behavior of the Ar-solvated K(+)-HFBz and Cl(-)-Bz aggregates.},

To asses whether micelles are needed for the hydrate to form only one SDS molecule has been considered. To figure out the possible mechanism through which the SDS promotes the formation of methane clathrate the dynamics of CH(4) solvation in the presence and absence of the surfactant molecule is monitored. To carry out the dynamical calculations, the SDS-H(2)O, SDS-CH(4), and CH(4)-H(2)O interactions were described using a recently proposed model potential. The adopted model leverages both on the decomposition of the molecular polarizability in effective components associated with the interaction centers distributed on the molecular frame and on the use of an improved Lennard-Jones functional form to represent the effective pair interaction energies. Molecular dynamics simulations performed on such potential, contrary to some earlier assumptions, do not support mechanisms requiring the formation of micelles as suggested by the findings of more recent experiments.},

 abstract = {The target of this investigation is to characterize by a recently developed methodology, the main features of the first solvation shells of alkaline ions in nonpolar environments due to aromatic rings, which is of crucial relevance to understand the selectivity of several biochemical phenomena. We employ an evolutionary algorithm to obtain putative global minima of clusters formed with alkali-ions (M(+)) solvated with n benzene (Bz) molecules, i.e., M(+)-(Bz)(n). The global intermolecular interaction has been decomposed in Bz-Bz and in M(+)-Bz contributions, using a potential model based on different decompositions of the molecular polarizability of benzene. Specifically, we have studied the microsolvation of Na(+), K(+), and Cs(+) with benzene molecules. Microsolvation clusters up to n = 21 benzene molecules are involved in this work and the achieved global minimum structures are reported and discussed in detail. We observe that the number of benzene molecules allocated in the first solvation shell increases with the size of the cation, showing three molecules for Na(+) and four for both K(+) and Cs(+). The structure of this solvation shell keeps approximately unchanged as more benzene molecules are added to the cluster, which is independent of the ion. Particularly stable structures, so-called "magic numbers", arise for various nuclearities of the three alkali-ions. Strong "magic numbers" appear at n = 2, 3, and 4 for Na(+), K(+), and Cs(+), respectively. In addition, another set of weaker "magic numbers" (three per alkali-ion) are reported for larger nuclearities.},

For this purpose, the components of the related force field were carefully formulated and assembled following the procedure previously adopted for methane. The properties of the whole system (as well as those of its components) were analyzed by carrying out extended molecular dynamics calculations. Contrary to what happens for methane, the calculations singled out the propensity of CO2 (pure) water clusters to form clathrate hydrate-like structures and the disappearance of such propensity when a single SDS molecule is added to the clusters. This feature was found to be due to the strong interaction of carbon dioxide with the additive that makes the SDS molecule lose its shape together with its ability to drive water molecules to form a suitable cage. },

 abstract = {Global potentials for the physisorption of rare-gas atoms on graphene and graphite, amenable for a variety of dynamics simulations, are reported. An atom–bond pairwise additive form of the potential is used, where the interaction pairs, represented by proper analytical functions, are constituted by the Rg atom (Rg = He, Ne, Ar, Kr) and the C–C bonds of the graphene sheet(s). The parameters of the atom–bond pair potential, derived from the polarizability of the interacting partners, are fine-tuned, exploiting calculations of the prototypical Rg–coronene system using high-level electronic structure methods and large basis sets. The atom–graphene/graphite potential is further expanded in a Fourier series, and it is found that for an accurate representation of the interaction only a small number of corrugation terms need to be added to the laterally averaged potential. Furthermore, this corrugation part of the potential is both identical for Rg–graphene and Rg–graphite; in other words, inner layers of graphite only play a role in the laterally averaged Rg–graphite potential. For all systems, the hollow at the center of the carbon ring is the preferred adsorption site, although diffusion barriers are low. The present results compare well with previous data regarding well depths and equilibrium distances at different adsorption sites and, for graphite, the long-range dispersion coefficient C 3. In addition, binding energies (eigenvalues of the laterally averaged potentials) are in a fairly good agreement with experimental determinations, providing further support for the reliability of the potentials.},

 abstract = {We employ a recently developed methodology to study structural and energetic properties of the first solvation shells of the potassium ion in nonpolar environments due to aromatic rings, which is important to understand the selectivity of several biochemical phenomena. Our evolutionary algorithm is used in the global optimization study of clusters formed of K(+) solvated with hexafluorobenzene (HFBz) molecules. The global intermolecular interaction for these clusters has been decomposed in HFBz-HFBz and in K(+)-HFBz contributions, using a potential model based on different decompositions of the molecular polarizability of hexafluorobenzene. Putative global minimum structures of microsolvation clusters up to 21 hexafluorobenzene molecules were obtained and compared with the analogous K(+)-benzene clusters reported in our previous work (J. Phys. Chem. A 2012, 116, 4947-4956). We have found that both K(+)-(Bz)n and K(+)-(HFBz)n clusters show a strong magic number around the closure of the first solvation shell. Nonetheless, all K(+)-benzene clusters have essentially the same first solvation shell geometry with four solvent molecules around the ion, whereas the corresponding one for K(+)-(HFBz)n is completed with nine HFBz species, and its structural motif varies as n increases. This is attributed to the ion-solvent interaction that has a larger magnitude for K(+)-Bz than in the case of K(+)-HFBz. In addition, the ability of having more HFBz than Bz molecules around K(+) in the first solvation shell is intimately related to the inversion in the sign of the quadrupole moment of the two solvent species, which leads to a distinct ion-solvent geometry of approach. },

These spectra are compared with the photoelectron spectra measured by using He(I) and Ne(I) photons under the same experimental conditions. In this way we obtained the negative energy shifts for the formation of H2S(+) ions in the first three accessible electronic states by He*(2(3,1)S1,0) and Ne*((3)P2,0) Penning ionization collisions: the 2b1 (X̃(2)B1) fundamental one, the first 5a1 (Ã(2)A1), and the second 2b2 (B̃(2)B2) excited states, respectively. The recorded energy shifts indicate that in the case of He* and Ne*-H2S the autoionization dynamics depends on the features of the collision complex and is mainly driven by an effective global attraction that comes from a balance among several non covalent intermolecular interaction components. This suggests that the Penning ionization should take place, in a specific range of intermolecular distances, as we have already observed in the case of Penning ionization of water molecules [Brunetti, B.

Quantum dynamical simulations on reliable new force fields are performed in order to assess the graphdiyne capability for helium chemical and isotopic separation. Exceptionally high He/CH4 selectivities are found in a wide range of temperatures which largely exceed the performance of the best membranes used to date for helium extraction from natural gas.

 abstract = {The double photoionization of CO(2) molecules has been studied in the 34-50 eV photon energy range, by the use of synchrotron radiation and detecting electron-ion and electron-ion-ion coincidences. Three processes have been observed: (i) the formation of the CO(2)(2+) molecular dication, (ii) the production of a metastable (CO(2)(2+))* that dissociates, with an apparent lifetime of 3.1 micros, giving rise to CO(+) and O(+) ions, and (iii) the dissociation leading to the same products, but occurring with a lifetime shorter than 0.05 micros. The relative dependence on the photon energy of the cross section for such processes has been measured. While for the production of the molecular dication a threshold is observed, in agreement with the vertical threshold for double ionization of CO(2), for the dissociative processes the threshold appears to be lower than that value, indicating the presence of an indirect dissociation, probably leading to the formation of CO(+) together with a neutral autoionizing oxygen atom.},

The stabilization component of the water-Ng bond has recently been attributed, through very accurate theoretical calculations and an unambiguous, model-free analysis of the electron density displacement, to a net electron transfer taking place from Ng to H(2)O. We review the theoretical analysis and discuss additional computational results, comparing them to experiment, that clarify the effect of charge transfer on the interaction energies.},

 abstract = {Total and partial cross sections for Penning ionization of methyl chloride and methyl bromide by metastable neon atoms have been measured as a function of collision energy in the 0.040−0.15 eV range. The partial cross sections for the formation of CH3X+, CH3 +, and CH2X+ (X = Cl, Br) show a decreasing trend, with different slopes, when the collision energy increases. The branching ratios indicate that the production of fragment ions is favored at higher energies. Based on new correlation rules that allow to estimate pure van der Waals but also charge-transfer contributions to intermolecular potentials, the anisotropy of the Ne*−CH3Cl interaction has been semiempirically estimated. Within the electron exchange model of Penning ionization, it is shown that the anisotropy of interaction, together with the anisotropy of electron distribution of the orbitals involved in ionization, is correlated with the behavior of the ionization cross sections and branching ratios as a function of collision energy. In particular, the presence of the attractive interaction at the two ends of the molecule is responsible for the decreasing energy dependence of the total ionization cross sections, while a softer repulsive wall around the methyl group is responsible for the increase of fragment ions when collision energy increases.},

Results averaged for the populated rotational levels at 300 K show that total ionization cross section decreases with translational energy.

 abstract = {Graphynes are novel two-dimensional carbon-based materials that have been proposed as molecular filters, especially for water purification technologies. We carry out first-principles electronic structure calculations at the MP2C level of theory to assess the interaction between water and graphyne, graphdiyne, and graphtriyne pores. The computed penetration barriers suggest that water transport is unfeasible through graphyne while being unimpeded for graphtriyne. For graphdiyne, with a pore size almost matching that of water, a low barrier is found that in turn disappears if an active hydrogen bond with an additional water molecule on the opposite side of the opening is considered. Thus, in contrast with previous determinations, our results do not exclude graphdiyne as a promising membrane for water filtration. In fact, present calculations lead to water permeation probabilities that are 2 orders of magnitude larger than estimations based on common force fields. A new pair potential for the water-carbon noncovalent component of the interaction is proposed for molecular dynamics simulations involving graphdiyne and water. },

The angular dependence of the lowest doublet potential energy surfaces (PES), correlating with Ar+(2Pj)–N2 and Ar–N2+(2Σ,2Π), has been given in terms of spherical harmonics, while the dependence on the intermolecular distance has been represented by proper radial coefficients. Such coefficients, which account for van der Waals, induction, charge transfer, and electrostatic contributions, have been predicted by empirical correlation formulas. The PES so obtained have been employed to calculate cross sections for the charge transfer process Ar++N2→Ar+N2+ at low collision energy (E⩽2 eV). A good agreement between calculated and experimental cross sections is obtained by assuming that the duration of the nonadiabatic transition has to match the time required for the molecular rearrangement into the final vibrational state. As a consequence the efficient formation of product ions into specific vibrational states is limited to well defined ranges of impact parameters. This treatment leads to a unified description of the major experimental findings.},

For NeS, the effects of extending the basis set, of a more accurate treatment of triple excitations within the coupled cluster method, and of the frozen core approximation are analyzed. The spin–orbit interaction is taken into account by the commonly used atomic model, whose validity is verified by the direct ab initio calculations of spin–orbit coupling matrix elements. The ab initio potentials are tested in the calculations of the absolute total scattering cross sections measured in molecular beams and compared with the potentials derived from the same data. This comparison, along with an analysis in terms of correlation formulas, proves the high accuracy of ab initio potentials and characterizes the sensitivity of scattering cross sections to the properties of interaction potentials.

The collisional alignment of the rotational angular momentum, corresponding to the orientation of the benzene molecular plane, in supersonic seeded expansions with lighter carrier gases is demonstrated via two complementary experiments: one interrogating benzene via polarized laser light IR absorption the other one probing its orientation via molecular beam scattering on rare gas targets. Typical seeding gases are helium, neon and their mixtures, and molecular hydrogen. Total stagnation pressures are of the order of ∼1 bar and ∼0.1 mm nozzle. A propensity is demonstrated for benzene molecules in seeded molecular beams to fly with the molecular plane preferentially oriented parallel to the molecular beam propagation direction. The analysis of the experimental results has been carried out using a phenomenological model which provides the fraction of molecules traveling in such a “frisbee” mode. A frisbee propensity function is defined and found to range between 0.71 and 0.85, corresponding to IR and to scattering experiments, respectively. These values are significantly higher than the value 2/3, expected for a random distribution of molecular plane orientations. The trend in the measured values is discussed in terms of different angular cones of the supersonic expansion sampled in the two experiments and evidence is provided that the orientation is higher the narrower is the sampled cone aperture.},

Potential energy curves, given in a simple, natural, and analytical form, made possible the calculations of some important properties, such as double-photoionization energy thresholds, vibrational spacing, average lifetime, and Franck-Condon factors. The predictions, compared with data available in the literature, are of great interest for the analysis and interpretation of some new experimental results.},

 abstract = {The double photoionization of HCl molecules by synchrotron radiation has been studied in the energy range between 30 and 50 eV. The HCl(2+) and Cl(2+) product ions have been detected by a photoelectron-photoion-coincidence technique, while the H(+)+Cl(+) formation, which follows the double ionization of HCl, has been studied by photoelectron-photoion-photoion coincidence. The photon energy threshold for the production of HCl(2+) ions has been found to be 35.4+/-0.6 eV, while for the dissociative channel leading to H(+)+Cl(+), it has been measured a threshold at 36.4+/-0.6 eV and a change in the slope of the cross-section energy dependence at 38.7+/-0.7 eV. The production of H+Cl(2+) occurs with a threshold photon energy of 42.8+/-1.1 eV. These results appear to be in a good agreement with previous data by different experimental techniques and recent theoretical calculations performed by our laboratory.},

 abstract = {The energetics of [Rg... N2O]* autoionizing collision complexes (where Rg=He or Ne) and their dynamical evolution have been studied in a crossed beam apparatus, respectively, by Penning ionization electron spectroscopy (PIES) and by mass spectrometry (MS) techniques in the thermal energy range. The PIES spectra, detected by an electron energy analyzer, were recorded for both complexes at four different collision energies. Such spectra allowed the determination of the energy shifts for Penning electron energy distributions, and the branching ratios for the population of different electronic states and for the vibrational population in the molecular nascent ions. For the [Ne...N2O]* collision complex it was found, by MS, that the autoionization leads to the formation of N2O+, NO+, O+, and NeN2O+ product ions whose total and partial cross sections were measured in the collision energy range between 0.03 and 0.2 eV. The results are analyzed exploiting current models for the Penning ionization process: the observed collision energy dependence in the PIES spectra as well as in the cross sections are correlated with the nature of the N2O molecule orbitals involved in the ionization and are discussed in term of the Rg-N2O interaction potentials, which are estimated by using a semiempirical method developed in our laboratory.},

The analysis is carried out by means of a semiempirical method based on the identification, modeling, and combination of the leading interaction components, including the effect of the selective polarization of the more external electronic cloud of the metastable atom in the intermolecular electric field. These and other crucial aspects of our approach have been quantitatively verified by ab initio calculations. The proposed method permits to evaluate the interaction at any configuration of the complexes and provides a useful and inexpensive representation of the intermolecular potential energy for dynamics studies. The main experimental findings can be rationalized taking into account the critical balancing between molecular orientation effects in the intermolecular interaction field and the ionization probability. These orientation effects tend to become less pronounced with increasing collision energy.},

Nonpolar molecules have so far escaped direct experimental investigations because of their poor sensitivity to several external constraints. Recently, it has been shown that the collisional alignment produced in supersonic expansions coupled with molecular-beam velocity selection can help solve such problems. Here we show that the sticking probability of ethylene, a nonpolar molecule prototypical of unsaturated hydrocarbons, on an O(2)-precovered Ag(001) surface is larger for molecules approaching in a helicopter-like motion than for those cartwheeling. A mechanism involving a weakly bound precursor state is suggested, with helicopter molecules having a lower chance of being scattered back into the gas phase than cartwheels when colliding with preadsorbed ethylene.},

These results have been interpreted by the use of a theoretical model which has been previously applied by us to HBr2+ and HCl2+. On the basis of the reliability of such a model, an assessment of the systematic trends of the bond features along the HX2+ (X=F, Cl, Br, I) homologous series is given in this paper.

A well resolved glory pattern has been measured which permitted the accurate characterization of the intermolecular potentials both at long range (in the attractive region) and at intermediate distances (in the well region). Considering the conditions used in the experiments, the obtained potentials must be considered very close to the spherical averages of the full intermolecular potential energy surfaces. Extensive ab initio calculations have also been carried out in parallel in order to characterize energy minima in the potential energy surfaces and energy barriers associated to the motion of the rare gas atoms around H2S. An assessment of the relative role of the various interaction components has been also attempted: the combined analysis of experimental and theoretical results suggests that H2S-rare gas aggregates are mainly bound by nearly isotropic noncovalent interactions of the van der Waals type.},

Isotopically labeled benzene molecules with a single deuterium atom have been used in order to study the symmetric dissociation of the benzene dication, not well evident in previous experiments. A threshold of 30.1 ± 0.1 eV has been observed for this dissociation reaction. Moreover, the lifetime of the dissociation of the benzene metastable dication producing CH(3)(+) and C(5)H(3)(+) has been obtained as a function of the photon energy, by the use of a Monte Carlo trajectory analysis of the coincidence distributions. The determined lifetime is independent of the photon energy and has an average value of 0.75 ± 0.22 μs. Theoretical calculations of the energy and structure of dissociation product ions have been also performed to provide crucial information about the dynamics of the charge separation reactions following the photoionization event.},

Data analysis, carried out by employing a recently proposed potential model, allows unique information on the absolute scale of the intermolecular interaction to be obtained both at long range and at the equilibrium distance. An extensive and internally consistent comparison with the behavior of the corresponding Kr-Ng systems is exploited in order to identify those cases where an interaction component due to charge transfer effects provides an appreciable intermolecular bond stabilization that is clearly distinct from and must be added to the standard van der Waals plus induction picture.

The anisotropy of the interaction is obtained from the Zeeman spectrum using both numerical and analytical approaches for the energy levels, and from the quenching of the diffraction oscillations in the total differential cross section within the infinite-order-sudden approximation. The latter approximation is practically exact under the experimental conditions, as previously shown for the similar Ne–N2 system by comparison with exact close-coupling scattering calculations.

 abstract = {In a crossed beam experiment, cross sections have been measured for the ion–molecule reactions Ar++H2→ArH++H and Ar++D2→ArD++D. Low collision energies (0.025≤E≤ 1 eV) and high resolution (ΔE∼10 meV, half-width at half-maximum) have been obtained using the method of guiding the ion beam by an octopole field and the technique of supersonic beams for H2 or D2. A structure in the energy dependence of cross sections has been found and attributed to a manifestation of vibronic resonances. Calculations are presented and compared to experimental findings to illustrate this effect, which arises because of the successive population of vibronic levels of the charge transfer complex Ar–H2+ or Ar–D2+, which are the intermediates for these reactions. Empirical potential energy surfaces for the entrance channels have been constructed accounting explicitly for the open shell nature and spin–orbit effects in Ar+(2PJ); symmetry considerations have also been used to establish the sequence of pertinent vibronic surfaces of the charge transfer intermediate complex—the role of configuration interaction in the latter is also discussed. The reaction dynamics has been treated as a sequence of nonadiabatic transitions at crossings of potential energy surfaces—quantum mechanical tunneling has been found crucial for the proper description of the observed energy dependence of the cross sections and the vibronic resonance structure. A higher frequency structure, borne out by the calculations and due to a manifold of metastable states supported by the vibronic levels of the intermediate charge transfer complex, appears to be washed out by the finite experimental resolution. It is also shown that finite experimental resolution had been the reason for the failure of detecting vibronic resonances in previous experiments and that the present ones are in general agreement with them when resolution is artificially lowered. Finally, it is pointed out that the present approach, when applied to charge transfer processes, provides a model which appears consistent with existing measurements. It also accounts for the observed selective reactivity of the fine structure components of argon ions.},

The magnetic analysis reveals that the excited N2 molecules are essentially in the A 3Σ+u metastable state but also evinces the presence of a small concentration of A′ 5Σ+g molecules, increasing with beam velocity. This allows us to estimate the mean collision free lifetime of the 5Σ+g metastable molecules by an experiment completely different from those usually performed to this purpose. Absolute total cross sections are measured both for the metastable and the ground state N2 by passing the molecular beam through a cooled scattering chamber containing Xe. From the analysis of the scattering data, the characterization of the intermolecular potential for both systems is obtained and from the potential parameters the average molecular polarizability of metastable N2 is obtained.},

The results provide the kinetic energy and angular distributions of product ions. The analysis of the results indicates that the dissociation leading to C(2)H(+)+H(+) products occurs through a metastable dication with a lifetime of 108±22 ns, and a kinetic energy release (KER) distribution exhibiting a maximum at ∼4.3 eV with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of about 60%. The reaction leading to CH(2)(+)+C(+) occurs in a time shorter than the typical rotational period of the acetylene molecules (of the order of 10(-12) s). The KER distribution of product ions for this reaction, exhibits a maximum at ∼4.5 eV with a FWHM of about 28%. The symmetric dissociation, leading to CH(+)+CH(+), exhibits a KER distribution with a maximum at ∼5.2 eV with a FWHM of 44%. For the first two reactions the angular distributions of ion products also indicate that the double photoionization of acetylene occurs when the neutral molecule is mainly oriented perpendicularly to the light polarization vector.},

Data obtained with a “hot” effusive molecular beam, which contains fast rotating and randomly oriented O2 molecules, mainly probe the spherical component of the potential energy surfaces. Experiments with supersonic seeded beams, where the oxygen molecules are cooled at the K=1 rotational level and selectively aligned [Aquilanti et al., Phys. Rev.

The analysis of the experimental results, based upon close-coupling exact quantum mechanical calculations of the cross sections, provides an accurate characterization of the interactions at intermediate and large intermolecular distances for the Kr-O2 and Xe-O2 systems. It is found that the most stable configuration of the two complexes is for perpendicular approach of the rare gas atom, with energies 15.84 for Kr and 17.87 meV for Xe, at intermolecular distances of 3.72 and 3.87 Å, respectively. An adiabatic approximation and a semiclassical description shed light on some general features of the collision dynamics of aligned molecules, in particular on the observed effects of the interaction anisotropy on the glory interference phenomenon.},

The present investigation aims at elucidating the possible mechanisms at the molecular collision level. Quantum state-to-state differential scattering cross sections, calculated for the prototype system O2–He, for an interaction potential previously obtained in this laboratory, exhibit propensities relevant to reveal nature and selective role of the elastic and inelastic scattering events, participating in the overall mechanisms which lead to molecular alignment and cooling. The present analysis shows that the dynamics of such phenomena crucially depends on the initial and final rotational state, on the collision energy, on the involved orbital angular momentum and therefore alternative routes are possible for molecular polarization and relaxation. These routes lead to scattering into specific angular cones and therefore observations from different experiments provide complementary pieces of information which, exploiting studies of various molecular systems under diverse experimental conditions, can be correlated in a single mosaic.},

 abstract = {The stereodynamics of the Penning ionization of water molecules by collision with metastable neon atoms, occurring in the thermal energy range, is of great relevance for the understanding of fundamental aspects of the physical chemistry of water. This process has been studied by analyzing the energy spectrum of the emitted electrons previously obtained in our laboratory in a crossed beam experiment [B. G. Brunetti, P. Candori, D. Cappelletti, S. Falcinelli, F. Pirani, D. Stranges, and F. Vecchiocattivi, Chem. Phys. Lett. 539-540, 19 (2012)]. For the spectrum analysis, a novel semiclassical method is proposed, that assumes ionization events as mostly occurring in the vicinities of the collision turning points. The potential energy driving the system in the relevant configurations of the entrance and exit channels, used in the spectrum simulation, has been formulated by the use of a semiempirical method. The analysis puts clearly in evidence how different approaches of the metastable atom to the water molecule lead to ions in different electronic states. In particular, it provides the angular acceptance cones where the selectivity of the process leading to the specific formation of each one of the two energetically possible ionic product states of H2O(+) emerges. It is shown how the ground state ion is formed when neon metastable atoms approach water mainly perpendicularly to the molecular plane, while the first excited electronic state is formed when the approach occurs preferentially along the C2v axis, on the oxygen side. An explanation is proposed for the observed vibrational excitation of the product ions. },

 abstract = {A combined analysis of both new (energy spectra of emitted electrons) and previously published (ionization cross sections) experimental data, measured under the same conditions and concerning electronically excited lighter noble gas -NH3 collisional autoionization processes, is carried out. Such an analysis, performed by exploiting a formulation of the full potential energy surface both in the real and imaginary parts, provides direct information on energetics, structure, and lifetime of the intermediate collision complex over all the configuration space. The marked anisotropy in the attraction of the real part, driving the approach of reagents, and the selective role of the imaginary component, associated to the charge transfer coupling between entrance and exit channels, suggests that reactive events occur almost exclusively in the molecular hemisphere containing the nitrogen lone pair. Crucial details on the stereo-dynamics of elementary collisional autoionization processes are then obtained, in which the open shell nature of the disclosed ionic core of metastable atom plays a crucial role. The same analysis also suggests that the strength of the attraction and the anisotropy of the interaction increases regularly along the series Ne*((3)P), He*((3)S), He*((1)S)-NH3. These findings can be ascribed to the strong rise of the metastable atom electronic polarizability (deformability) along the series. The obtained results can stimulate state of the art ab initio calculations focused on specific features of the transition state (energetics, structure, lifetime, etc.) which can be crucial for a further improvement of the adopted treatment and to better understand the nature of the leading interaction components which are the same responsible for the formation of the intermolecular halogen and hydrogen bond.},

The observed coexistence of various geometries for Ne suggests the motion of the RG atoms on the multi-well potential energy surface landscape offered by the coronene. Therefore, the investigation of different clusters enables a comparative analysis of localized versus non-localized features. Mixed Ar-He-coronene clusters have also been considered and the competition of the RG atoms to occupy the docking sites on the molecule is discussed. All the obtained information is crucial to assess the behavior of coronene, a prototypical polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon clustering with RG atoms at a temperature close to that of interstellar medium, which arises from the critical balance of the interactions involved.},

 abstract = {The fate of dimethyl ether (DME, CH<sub>3</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>) in collisions with He<sup>+</sup> ions is of high relevance for astrochemical models aimed at reproducing the abundances of complex organic molecules in the interstellar medium. Here we report an investigation on the reaction of He<sup>+</sup> ions with DME carried out using a Guided Ion Beam Mass Spectrometer (GIB-MS), which allows the measurement of reactive cross-sections and branching ratios (BRs) as a function of the collision energy. We obtain insights into the dissociative charge (electron) exchange mechanism by investigating the nature of the non-adiabatic transitions between the relevant potential energy surfaces (PESs) in an improved Landau-Zener approach. We find that the large interaction anisotropy could induce a pronounced orientation of the polar DME molecule in the electric field generated by He<sup>+</sup> so that at short distances the collision complex is confined within pendular states, a particular case of bending motion, which gives rise to intriguing stereodynamic effects. The positions of the intermolecular potential energy curve crossings indicate that He<sup>+</sup> captures an electron from an inner valence orbital of DME, thus causing its dissociation. In addition to the crossing positions, the symmetry of the electron density distribution of the involved DME orbitals turns out to be a further major point affecting the probability of electron transfer. Thus, the anisotropy of the intermolecular interaction and the electron densities of the orbitals involved in the reaction are the key "ingredients" for describing the dynamics of this dissociative charge transfer.},

A detailed graphical analysis of the potential plus a quantitative analysis of the computed opacity functions, of the state-to-state rate coefficients, of the second virial coefficient and of the integral non-reactive cross section allowed us to conclude that the model formulation of the interaction has to be preferred for non-reactive studies of the O<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub> energy transfer processes in thermal and subthermal regimes.},

 abstract = {Although there is a long history behind the idea of chemical structure, this is a key concept that continues to challenge chemists. Chemical structure is fundamental to understanding most of the properties of matter and its knowledge for complex systems requires the use of state-of-the-art techniques, either experimental or theoretical. From the theoretical view point, one needs to establish the interaction potential among the atoms or molecules of the system, which contains all the information regarding the energy landscape, and employ optimization algorithms to discover the relevant stationary points. In particular, global optimization methods are of major importance to search for the low-energy structures of molecular aggregates. We review the application of global optimization techniques to several molecular clusters; some new results are also reported. Emphasis is given to evolutionary algorithms and their application in the study of the microsolvation of alkali-metal and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions with various types of solvents.This article is part of the themed issue 'Theoretical and computational studies of non-equilibrium and non-statistical dynamics in the gas phase, in the condensed phase and at interfaces'.},

 abstract = {The present paper focuses on the characterization of the properties of methanol and water molecules in gas and liquid environments. A force field for methanol-methanol and methanol-water interactions, useful to be applied in Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, is proposed. The electrostatic interaction contributions, arising from permanent charge and/or from anisotropic charge distributions originating from permanent electric multipoles (V<sub>el</sub>), different in gas and in liquid phases, are combined with the non electrostatic ones (V<sub>nel</sub>), defined by means of Improved Lennard-Jones (ILJ) functions [F. Pirani et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2008, 10, 5489-5503]. Interestingly, the relevant parameters of the ILJ functions are not fitted to reproduce the selected properties of the systems but calculated from the molecular polarizability, which is considered the key property to define size (or Pauli) repulsion and dispersion and induction attractions. The constructed force field predicts binding energies and geometries of the methanol-methanol and methanol-water dimers, in good agreement with available data. On the other hand, several bulk and structural properties of liquid methanol, such as densities, vaporization enthalpies, diffusion coefficients, coefficients of cubic thermal expansion, heat capacities at constant pressure and some relevant radial distribution functions, calculated considering 2744 molecules and different conditions of pressure and temperature, have also been found to be in good agreement with experimental data. The study has been completed by calculating the density values at 298 K and 1 bar of some methanol-water mixtures, which have also been found to be in good agreement with experimental data.},

In particular, the paper focuses on the rationalization of the non-Arrhenius behavior (inversion of the temperature dependence) of the quasi-resonant vibration-to-vibration energy transfer transition rate coefficients at threshold. To better understand the microscopic nature of the involved processes, we pushed the calculations to the detail of the related cross sections and analyzed the impact of the medium and long-range components of the interaction on them. Furthermore, the variation with temperature of the dependence of the quasi-resonant rate coefficient on the vibrational energy gap between initial and final vibrational states and the effectiveness of quantum-classical calculations to overcome the limitations of the purely classical treatments were also investigated. These treatments, handled in an open molecular science fashion by chaining data and competencies of the various laboratories using a grid empowered molecular simulator, have allowed a rationalization of the dependence of the computed rate coefficients in terms of the distortion of the O<sub>2</sub>-N<sub>2</sub> configuration during the diatom-diatom collisions. A way of relating such distortions to a smooth and continuous progress variable, allowing a proper evolution from both long to closer range formulation of the interaction and from its entrance to exit channel (through the strong interaction region) relaxed graphical representations, is also discussed in the paper.},

We report an analytical potential energy surface for modeling the coronene–coronene interaction, whose parameters were fine-tuned on dispersion-corrected DFT estimations performed within the generalized gradient PBE approximation, that is suitable for describing molecular aggregates involving aromatic species. This model was used to build a potential function for coronene clusters (Cor n ) that was then applied in a detailed global geometry optimization study with an evolutionary algorithm. A large variety of low-energy structures were obtained for the Cor n (n = 2–15) clusters ranging from columnar-type to two-stacked in a handshake association motifs. Moreover, it was found that a transition from a single-stack columnar regime to other more complex shapes occurs at n = 6, whereas previous results based on a simpler coarse-grained potential pointed to a transition at n = 8. Geometry reoptimizations were also performed at the DFT level for the most representative low-energy structures of Cor n (n = 3–6), which confirmed the reliability of the present findings.},

For the first time we have unambiguously ascertained that helium is able not only to donate electron density, but also, unexpectedly, to accept electron density in the formation of weakly bound adducts with highly polar substrates. The presence of a large dipole moment induces a large electric field at He, which lowers its 2p orbital energy and enables receipt of π electron density.

One of the most efficient approaches to calculate vibration to vibration (VV) energy transfer relies on a quantum-classical method, which couples a rigorous quantum mechanical treatment of the vibrations and a quasiclassical description of the other degrees of freedom, allowing for the calculation of energy exchange probabilities for a large body of state selected processes at a reasonable computational cost. The accuracy of the results however depends on the ability of the potential energy surface to correctly describe both long and short range interactions which dominate the outcome of the collisions at different temperatures. In this work we examine the effect of using alternative potential energy surfaces, differing either for the value of the employed parameters and for their formulation, on VV cross sections and rate constants.},

Acetylene was also found as a minor component in the atmosphere of gas giants like the planet Jupiter, in the atmosphere of Saturn’s satellite Titan, and in comets, where photochemical experiments have demonstrated that this simple hydrocarbon is a likely precursor of C2, a widely observed component in such environments. It has to be noted that the presence in planetary atmospheres and ISM of Vacuum Ultra Violet (VUV) light’s photons as well as cosmic rays makes highly probable the double photoionization of molecular species with the production of molecular dications producing subsequent dissociation into ionic fragments having a high kinetic energy content of several eV. This translational energy is sufficient in some cases to allow ions escape from the upper atmosphere of some planet of the Solar System, as Venus, Mars and Titan, into space. In this contribution we present the experimental study of the microscopic dynamics of the two-body dissociation reactions of the C2H2+2 dication, induced by the double ionization of acetylene molecules by VUV photons in the energy range of 31.9–50.0 eV. The photoionizing agent was a tunable synchrotron radiation beam, while ion products are revealed by coupling photoelectron-photoion-photoion-coincidence and ion imaging techniques. The measured angular distributions and kinetic energy of product ions exhibit significant changes (as the photon energy increases) for the three leading dissociation reactions producing H++C2H+, C++CH2+, and CH++CH+, providing detailed information on the fragmentation dynamics of the C2H22+ dication.},

 abstract = {The focus of the present work is on the detailed characterization of the most relevant components of the intermolecular interaction, which determine anisotropic force fields driving the molecular dynamics under a variety of conditions. This target is here achieved by combining in a unifying picture the results of different type of experiments, probing complementary aspects of the intermolecular interactions involved. In particular, the analysis of high-resolution scattering data led to an accurate evaluation of the strength and anisotropy of non-covalent interaction components, due to the balance of size (or Pauli) repulsion with dispersion and induction attraction, to which electrostatic contributions must be added. Moreover, for the complete representation of the intermolecular interaction other components of covalent (chemical) nature, mostly affected by charge (electron) transfer effects, must be properly taken into account. Particular attention has been recently devoted to some experimental findings probing in detail the strength, range, anisotropy and role of the charge transfer effects. Obtained results have been important to develop suitable analytical representations for the potential energy surfaces (PESs), tested and improved by exploiting also the comparison with results of ab initio calculations, useful to provide an internally consistent description of the intermolecular interaction both in the most and less stable configurations of the interacting system. The complete and appropriate formulation of the PESs must be then considered crucial not only to describe the dynamics of elementary processes occurring in interstellar medium and in planetary atmospheres, but also to control equilibrium and non-equilibrium phenomena of applied interest, as those occurring in combustion, flames and plasmas.},

 abstract = {The inelastic scattering of D2 and HD molecules impinging on a graphite surface in well-defined initial roto-vibrational states has been studied by using the computational setup recently developed to characterize important selectivities in the molecular dynamics occurring at the gas-surface interface. In order to make an immediate comparison of determined elastic and inelastic scattering probabilities, we considered for D2 and HD molecules the same initial states, as well as the same collision energy range, previously selected for the investigation of H2 behaviour. The analysis of the back-scattered molecules shows that, while low-lying initial vibrational states are preserved, the medium–high initial ones give rise to final states covering the complete ladder of vibrational levels, although with different probability for the various cases investigated. Moreover, propensities in the formation of the final rotational states are found to depend strongly on the initial ones, on the collision energy, and on the isotopologue species.},

<p> The relative role of halogen and hydrogen bonding in the stabilization of water adducts with apolar molecules is investigated by an integrated experimental–theoretical study. Molecular beam scattering experiments led to the characterization of the gas phase behaviour of H <sub>2</sub> O–CCl <sub>4</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> O–CF <sub>4</sub> systems, with the determination of the absolute scale of the interaction. Highly accurate ab initio calculations allow identifying the most stable energy configurations and the electron charge transferred upon adduct formation. The combined study is important to unambiguously identify the role of various components in the interaction (electrostatic, dispersion, induction and charge transfer) and for formulating a reliable model of the interaction potential. Our results suggest that, while the water–CF <sub>4</sub> adduct is basically bound through the balance between size (Pauli) repulsion and dispersion attraction, an appreciable intermolecular bond stabilization by charge transfer is operative in water–CCl <sub>4</sub> . We identified a sizable charge transfer not only from H <sub>2</sub> O to CCl <sub>4</sub> , mostly for the vertex (halogen bonding) configuration, but also from CCl <sub>4</sub> to H <sub>2</sub> O, for configurations where an H atom points at a chlorine centre, thus evidencing a hydrogen bond. </p>},

 abstract = {Graphynes are porous derivatives of graphene that can be considered as ideal 2D nanofilters. Here, we investigate by theoretical methods graphtriyne multilayers, proposing them as membranes featuring pores of subnanometer size suitable for CO2/N2 separation and CO2 uptake. The potential energy surfaces, representing the intermolecular interactions within the CO2/N2 gaseous mixtures and between the graphtriyne layers and the molecules, have been formulated in an internally consistent way, by adopting potential models far more accurate than the traditional Lennard-Jones functions, routinely used to predict static and dynamical properties of matter. The new force fields so obtained and tested on accurate ab initio calculations have been used to perform extensive molecular dynamics simulations of membrane selectivity and adsorption. The accuracy of the potentials granted a quantitative description of the interactions and realistic results for the dynamics under a wide range of conditions of applied interest, indicating a single-layer permeation ratio CO2/N2 of 4.25 (meaning that permeations of CO2 are typically 4.25 times those of N2). At low pressure, graphtriyne bilayer membranes exhibit good performances as a molecular sieving candidate for postcombustion CO2 separation because of a high permeance and a relatively good selectivity. On the other hand, graphtriyne trilayer membranes present a relatively high interlayer adsorption selectivity and a high CO2 uptake. Such properties make these graphyne nanostructures versatile materials competitive with other carbon-based adsorbing membranes suitable to cope with post-combustion CO2 emissions. Moreover, guidelines for the extension of the proposed methodology to carbon nanostructures and other gaseous mixtures of relevance for atmosphere and combustion are also provided.},

A careful analysis of recorded electron-ion-ion coincidence spectra mainly based on a Monte Carlo trajectory simulation is able to provide also the kinetic energy released (KER) distribution for the final ions of the investigated fragmentation reactions. These important experimental data are mandatory information to unravel the physical chemistry of the elementary processes induced by the interaction of photons, with simple relevant organic molecules: (i) the methyloxirane of astrochemical interest, being the first chiral molecule recently discovered in interstellar cloud Sagittarius B2; (ii) the N-methylformamide, being an important simple molecule containing the peptide bond, recently detected in the interstellar medium, in order to investigate its selective cleavage induced by UV photons.

This effort has permitted the construction of a simple, reliable and easily generalizable analytical model potential formulation, which is based on a few physically meaningful parameters of the interacting partners and transparently shows the origin, strength, and stereospecificity of the various interaction components. The results demonstrate quantitatively beyond doubt that the interaction between a noble-gas (Ng) atom - even He - and Cl2 in a collinear configuration is characterized by weak halogen bond (XB) formation, accompanied by charge transfer (CT) from the Ng to chlorine. This characteristic, which stabilizes the adduct, rapidly disappears on going towards the T-shaped configuration, dominated by pure van der Waals (vdW) forces. Similarly, a pure vdW interaction takes place - with no CT component in any configuration - if Cl2 is present in the lowest πg* → σu* excited state, because the change in electron density that accompanies the excitation eliminates the Cl2 polar flattening and σ hole, making the XB interaction inaccessible.},

 abstract = { Context . To correctly model the abundances of interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs) in different environments, both formation and destruction routes should be appropriately accounted for. While several scenarios have been explored for the formation of iCOMs via grain and gas-phase processes, much less work has been devoted to understanding the relevant destruction pathways, with special reference to (dissociative) charge exchange or proton transfer reactions with abundant atomic and molecular ions such as He + , H 3 + and HCO + .   Aims . By using a combined experimental and theoretical methodology we provide new values for the rate coefficients and branching ratios (BRs) of the reactions of He + ions with two important iCOMs, namely dimethyl ether (DME) and methyl formate (MF). We also review the destruction routes of DME and MF by other two abundant ions, namely H 3 + and HCO + .   Methods . Based on our recent laboratory measurements of cross sections and BRs for the DME/MF + He + reactions over a wide collision energy, we extended our theoretical insights on the selectivity of the microscopic dynamics to calculate the rate coefficients k ( T ) in the temperature range from 10 to 298 K. We implemented these new and revised kinetic data in a general model of cold and warm gas, simulating environments where DME and MF have been detected.   Results . Due to stereodynamical effects present at low collision energies, the rate coefficients, BRs and temperature dependences here proposed differ substantially from those reported in KIDA and UDfA, two of the most widely used astrochemical databases. These revised rates impact the predicted abundances of DME and MF, with variations up to 40% in cold gases and physical conditions similar to those present in prestellar cores.   Conclusions . This work demonstrates that the accuracy of astrochemical models can be improved by a thorough characterisation of the destruction routes of iCOMs. The details of the chemical systems can, indeed, strongly affect their efficiency and significant deviations with respect to the commonly used Langevin model estimates are possible. },

 abstract = {A new analytical potential energy surface is proposed to investigate, by semiclassical molecular dynamics calculations, the scattering of O2 molecules in well-defined initial roto–vibrational (v i, j i) states from graphite under a variety of conditions of applied interest. The reaction dynamics appears to be dominated by the coupling between translational and rotational internal degrees of freedom of molecule, that, at low-medium collision energies, can be also triggered by the energy exchange with the surface phonons. The final states (v f, j f) of backscattered molecules are characterized and carefully analyzed. Most important results are the following: (1) after the interaction with the surface, molecules are backscattered mainly in a direction very close to the specular one; (2) v i is preserved, except for high initial vibrational states; (3) the surface temperature plays a minor role; and (4) the final j f states exhibit non-Boltzmann distributions with the main peak nearby j f = j i and a secondary maximum at very high j f. Moreover, the features of rotational distributions suggest a close correlation between the initial rotational configuration of impinging molecules and the final state achieved after the scattering. These findings, complementary to those from molecular beam experiments, cast light on relevant selectivities in elastic and inelastic collision events that control the stereodynamics of several elementary processes occurring both in gaseous and condensed phases for low energy (as those meet in the interstellar medium) as well as for high energy (as those of interest for aerospace applications).},

On the one hand, mass spectra of doped helium clusters ionized with a crossed electron beam, He<sub>N</sub>Cs<sup>+</sup>, have been recorded for sizes up to N = 60. The analysis of the ratio between the observed peaks for each size N reveals evidences of the closure of the first solvation shell when 17 He atoms surround the alkali ion. On the other hand, we have obtained energies and geometrical structures of the title clusters by means of basin-hopping, diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC), and path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) methods.

The weakness of the existing interaction between helium and Cs<sup>+</sup> in comparison with some other alkali ions such as Li<sup>+</sup> is found to play a crucial role.

Measurements have been performed under the experimental condition to resolve the glory pattern, a quantum interference effect observable in the collision velocity dependence of the integral cross section. We analyzed the experimental data with a reliable potential model defined as a combination of an anisotropic van der Waals component with the additional contribution due to charge transfer and polar flattening effects related to the formation of an intermolecular halogen bond. The model involves few parameters, whose values are related to fundamental physical properties of the interacting partners, and it allows an internally consistent comparison of the stability of the gas-phase adducts formed by Br<sub>2</sub> moiety with different noble gases as well as homologous complexes with the Cl<sub>2</sub> molecule. The same model appears to be also easily generalized to describe the interaction of diatomic halogen molecules in the excited B(<sup>3</sup>Π) electronic state where the halogen bond contribution tends to vanish and more anisotropic van der Waals components dominate the structure of the complexes with noble gases.},

 abstract = {Electric and magnetic field gradients, arising from sufficiently strong anisotropic intermolecular forces, tend to induce molecular polarization which can often modify substantially the results of molecular collisions, especially at low rotational temperatures and low collision energies. The knowledge of these phenomena, today still not fully understood, is of general relevance for the control of the stereo-dynamics of elementary chemical-physical processes, involving neutral and ionic species under a variety of conditions. This paper reports on results obtained by combining information from scattering, spectroscopic and reactivity experiments, within a collaboration between the research groups in Perugia and Trento. We addressed particular attention to the reactions of small atomic ions with polar neutrals for their relevance in several environments, including interstellar medium, planetary atmospheres, and laboratory plasmas. In the case of ion-molecule reactions, alignment/orientation is a general phenomenon due to the electric field generated by the charged particle. Such phenomenon originates critical stereo-dynamic effects that can either suppress (when the orientation drives the collision complex into non-reactive or less reactive configurations), or enhance the reactivity (when orientation confines reagents in the most appropriate configuration for reaction). The associated rate coefficients show the propensity to follow an Arrhenius and a non-Arrhenius behavior, respectively.},

 abstract = {Recent developments in the experimental study of Penning ionization reactions are presented here to cast light on basic aspects of the stereo-dynamics of the microscopic mechanisms involved. They concern the dependence of the reaction probability on the relative orientation of the atomic and molecular orbitals of reagents and products. The focus is on collisions between metastable Ne<sup>*</sup>(<sup>3</sup>P<sub>2, 0</sub>) atoms with other noble gas atoms or molecules, for which play a crucial role both the inner open-shell structure of Ne<sup>*</sup> and the HOMO orbitals of the partner. Their mutual orientation with respect to the intermolecular axis controls the characteristics of the intermolecular potential, which drives the collision dynamics and the reaction probability. The investigation of ionization processes of water, the prototype of hydrogenated molecules, suggested that the ground state of water ion is produced when Ne<sup>*</sup> approaches H<sub>2</sub>O perpendicularly to its plane. Conversely, collisions addressed toward the lone pair, aligned along the water C<sub>2v</sub> symmetry axis, generates electronically excited water ions. However, obtained results refer to a statistical/random orientation of the open shell ionic core of Ne<sup>*</sup>. Recently, the attention focused on the ionization of Kr or Xe by Ne<sup>*</sup>, for which we have been able to characterize the dependence on the collision energy of the branching ratio between probabilities of spin orbit resolved elementary processes. The combined analysis of measured PIES spectra suggested the occurrence of contributions from four different reaction channels, assigned to two distinct spin-orbit states of the Ne<sup>*</sup>(<sup>3</sup>P<sub>2, 0</sub>) reagent and two different spin-orbit states of the ionic M<sup>+</sup>(<sup>2</sup>P<sub>3/2, 1/2</sub>) products (M = Kr, Xe).

These findings have been assumed to arise from a critical balance of <i>adiabatic</i> and <i>non-adiabatic effects</i> that control formation and electronic rearrangement of the collision complex, respectively.

 abstract = {Interactions of atomic cations with molecular hydrogen are of interest for a wide range of applications in hydrogen technologies. These interactions are fairly strong despite being non-covalent, hence one can ask whether hydrogen molecules would form dense, solid-like, solvation shells around the ion (snowballs) or rather a more weakly bound compound. In this work, the interactions between Cs+ and H2 are studied both experimentally and computationally. Isotopic substitution of H2 by D2 is also investigated. On the one hand, helium nanodroplets doped with cesium and hydrogen or deuterium are ionized by electron impact and the (H2/D2)nCs+ (up to n = 30) clusters formed are identified via mass spectrometry. On the other hand, a new analytical potential energy surface, based on ab initio calculations, is developed and used to study cluster energies and structures by means of classical and quantum-mechanical Monte Carlo methods. The most salient features of the measured ion abundances are remarkably mimicked by the computed evaporation energies, particularly for the clusters composed of deuterium. This result supports the reliability of the present potential energy surface and allows us to recommend its use in related systems. Clusters with either twelve H2 or D2 molecules stand out for their stability and quasi-rigid icosahedral structures. However, the first solvation shell involves thirteen or fourteen molecules for hydrogenated or deuterated clusters, respectively. This shell retains its internal structure when extra molecules are added to the second shell and is nearly solid-like, especially for the deuterated clusters. The role played by three-body induction interactions as well as the rotational degrees of freedom is analyzed and they are found to be significant (up to 15% and 18%, respectively) for the molecules belonging to the first solvation shell.},

 abstract = {The analysis of recent Penning ionization electron spectra as a function of the collision energy for both Ne*-Kr and Ne*-Xe autoionizing reactions allowed the development of a new general theoretical approach able to fully describe the stereodynamics of the Penning ionization reactions at a state to state level. Details on such a general and original approach based on the dependence of the reaction probability on the relative orientation of the atomic and molecular orbitals of reagents and products, are given. The mutual orientation of the collisional partners with respect to the intermolecular axis of the intermediate $$[{{\rm Ne}}{\hbox{---}}{{\rm Rg}}]^* $$ (with Rg = Kr or Xe) excited collision complex (i.e. the transition state of studied reactions) controls the characteristics of the intermolecular potential, which is formulated in a new analytical form whose details are presented and discussed. Obtained results refer to a statistical/random orientation of the open shell ionic core of Ne*, and in the two cases of Ne*-Kr and Ne*-Xe autoionizing collisions, we were able to reproduce and characterize the dependence on the collision energy of the experimental branching ratio between probabilities of spin-orbit resolved elementary processes already published. Such findings result from anisotropy effects connected to atomic orbital orientation/alignment, and their full understanding is a crucial point to describe the dependence of the stereo-dynamics on the electronic structure of the $$[{{\rm Ne}}{\hbox{---}}{{\rm Rg}}]^* $$ transition state. In this way, we are able to fully characterize the state to state reaction probability for the Penning ionization reactions involving Kr and Xe atoms with ionizing Ne* atoms in either 3P2 and 3P0 sublevels. This original methodology can be applied also to Penning ionization processes involving molecular targets, and in principle is able to point out the basic role of electronic rearrangements inside the transition state of various types of chemical reactions at thermal and sub-thermal collision energies which are of interest in astrochemical environments, being a much more arduous problem in order to be completely characterized.},

We propose semiempirical potential energy functions that are able to describe the interaction between K+ or Cs+ with coronene. Such functions were calibrated through the comparison with accurate estimations of the interaction between the cation and the planar hydrocarbon, obtained by means of ab initio electronic-structure calculations. By employing the potential energy functions and an evolutionary algorithm (EA), we have investigated the structure and energetics of the clusters resulting from the microsolvation of either K+ or Cs+ with coronene molecules. The reliability of the results for smaller clusters was checked by performing geometry re-optimization exploiting a suitable DFT level of theory. This has allowed for the characterization of the first solvation shells of planar molecules of coronene around an alkali-metal ion. It has also been found that the presence of metal ion impurities considerably enhances the formation of small coronene clusters leading to much stronger binding energies for heterogeneous with respect to homogeneous aggregates. These clusters could represent relevant species involved in the early stages of soot nucleation.},

water purification technologies. In this work we carry out first principles
electronic structure calculations at the MP2C level of theory to assess the
interaction between water and graphyne, graphdiyne and graphtriyne pores. The
computed penetration barriers suggest that water transport is unfeasible
through graphyne while being unimpeded for graphtriyne. Nevertheless, for
graphdiyne, which presents a pore size almost matching that of water, a low
barrier is found which in turn disappears if an active hydrogen bond with an
additional water molecule on the opposite side of the opening is taken into
account. These results support the possibility of using graphtriyne as an
efficient membrane for water filtration but, in contrast with previous
determinations, they do not exclude graphdiyne. In fact, the related first
principles penetration barrier leads to water permeation probabilities which
are at least two order of magnitude larger than those estimated by employing
commonly used force fields. A new pair potential for the water--carbon
non-covalent component of the interaction has been built and it is recommended

the formation of iCOMs via grain and gas-phase processes, much less work has
been devoted to understanding the relevant destruction pathways, with special
reference to (dissociative) charge exchange or proton transfer reactions with
abundant atomic and molecular ions such as He$^+$, H$_3^+$ and HCO$^+$. By
using a combined experimental and theoretical methodology we provide new values

proposed differ substantially from those reported in KIDA and UDfA, two of the

The relative cross sections and the threshold energies for all fragmentation channels are recorded as a function of the photon energy. Furthermore, in the case of the double photoionization of propylene oxide, the measure of the kinetic energy released distribution for the CH3 +/C2H3O+ final ions with their angular distributions allowed the identification of a bimodal behavior indicating the possible formation of two different stable isomers of C2H3O+: acetyl and oxiranyl cations.

Phys., 2008, 10, 4281], has been presented to improve its description of, particularly, the short range behavior for specific configurations, with the aim of producing a large database of vibration to vibration (V-V) and vibration to translation/rotation (V-T/R) energy transfer rate coefficients, with an increased accuracy extended to large temperature ranges relevant to the modeling of hypersonic gas flows. The modifications were introduced in a physically meaningful fashion and they are shown to improve the performance of the PES in a wide temperature range, not only for calculating rate coefficients, but also for determining a variety of physical properties. This new PES was then used to calculate V-V and V-T/R rate coefficients for inelastic N<sub>2</sub>-N<sub>2</sub> collisions through a mixed quantum-classical method, based on the quantum treatment of molecular vibrations, for vibrationally excited states up to v = 40. Such a large V-T/R coefficient database is quite unprecedented, and the comparison of the efficiency of the related processes with the corresponding V-V coefficients shows that vibrational relaxation plays a very relevant role in high temperature regimes.},

Molecules in well-defined initial internal vibrational and rotational states (v i , j i ) impinge on the surface with collisional energy (E coll) covering the range from thermal (0.01 eV) up to hyperthermal values (2.0 eV). In addition to the ground state of ortho and para symmetry, nitrogen molecules excited initially in low-medium v i and j i levels have been also considered. The main features of scattering dynamics, already reported in the literature, are confirmed on a larger range of both initial rotational levels and collision energies. However, new selectivity and stereodynamics effects are highlighted by studying in detail the microscopic mechanisms driven by the interaction that promotes physisorption. This investigation contributes also to a broader understanding of molecular scattering from surfaces by relating observed effects to phenomena controlled by rotational alignment and rotational rainbow, already well-characterized both experimentally and theoretically, in gas phase collisions and for molecular scattering from metallic surfaces.},

Spectroscopic constants, rotovibrational energies, and lifetime as a function of temperature have been evaluated for the complete family of H 2 S‐Ng systems, and an extensive study of involved intermolecular interactions has been performed. In particular, their nature has been characterized by exploiting Atoms‐In‐Molecules (AIM), Non‐Covalent Interactions (NCI), Symmetry‐Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT), and Charge Displacement (CD) methods, and it was found that all complexes are bound essentially by near‐isotropic van der Waals forces, perturbed by weak‐stabilizing charge (electron) transfer contributions. Obtained results also show that these additional contributions increase from He up to Rn, providing an appreciable chemical‐stabilizing effect of the noncovalent intermolecular bond for H 2 S‐heavier Ng systems. },

@article{pub.1130841204,
 abstract = {ConspectusMost chemical processes are triggered by electron or charge transfer phenomena (CT). An important class of processes involving CT are chemi-ionization reactions. Such processes are very common in nature, involving neutral species in ground or excited electronic states with sufficient energy (X*) to yield ionic products, and are considered as the primary initial step in flames. They are characterized by pronounced electronic rearrangements that take place within the collisional complex (X···M)* formed by approaching reagents, as shown by the following scheme, where M is an atomic or molecular target: X* + M → (X···M)* → [(X<sup>+</sup>···M) ↔ (X···M<sup>+</sup>)]<sup><i>e</i>-</sup> <math><mover><mo>→</mo><mrow><mi>via</mi><mo>⁡</mo><msup><mi>e</mi><mo>-</mo></msup><mo>⁡</mo><mi>CT</mi></mrow></mover></math> (X···M)<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>-</sup> → final ions.Despite their important role in fundamental and applied research, combustion, plasmas, and astrochemistry, a unifying description of these basic processes is still lacking. This Account describes a new general theoretical methodology that demonstrates, for the first time, that chemi-ionization reactions are prototypes of gas phase oxidation processes occurring via two different microscopic mechanisms whose relative importance varies with collision energy, <i>E</i><sub>c</sub>, and separation distance, <i>R</i>. These mechanisms are illustrated for simple collisions involving Ne*(<sup>3</sup>P<sub>2,0</sub>) and noble gases (Ng). In thermal and hyperthermal collisions probing interactions at intermediate and short <i>R</i>, the transition state [(Ne···Ng)<sup>+</sup>]<sup><i>e</i>-</sup> is a molecular species described as a molecular ion core with an orbiting Rydberg electron in which the neon reagent behaves as a halogen atom (i.e., F) with high electron affinity promoting chemical oxidation. Conversely, subthermal collisions favor a different reaction mechanism: Ng chemi-ionization proceeds through another transition state [Ne*······Ng], a weakly bound diatomic-lengthened complex where Ne* reagent, behaving as a Na atom, loses its metastability and stimulates an electron ejection from M by a concerted emission-absorption of a "virtual" photon. This is a physical radiative mechanism promoting an effective photoionization. In the thermal regime of <i>E</i><sub>c</sub>, there is a competition between these two mechanisms. The proposed method overcomes previous approaches for the following reasons: (1) it is consistent with all assumptions invoked in previous theoretical descriptions dating back to 1970; (2) it provides a simple and general description able to reproduce the main experimental results from our and other laboratories during last 40 years; (3) it demonstrates that the two "exchange" and "radiative" mechanisms are simultaneously present with relative weights that change with <i>E</i><sub>c</sub> (this viewpoint highlights the fact that the "canonical" chemical oxidation process, dominant at high <i>E</i><sub>c</sub>, changes its nature in the subthermal regime to a direct photoionization process; therefore, it clarifies differences between the cold chemistry of terrestrial and interstellar environments and the energetic one of combustion and flames); (4) the proposed method explicitly accounts for the influence of the degree of valence orbital alignment on the selective role of each reaction channel as a function of <i>E</i><sub>c</sub> and also permits a description of the collision complex, a rotating adduct, in terms of different Hund's cases of angular momentum couplings that are specific for each reaction channel; (5) finally, the method can be extended to reaction mechanisms of redox, acid-base, and other important condensed phase reactions.},

 abstract = {An integrated experimental-theoretical investigation was employed to determine rovibrational energies, spectroscopic constants, lifetime as a function of temperature in gas phase complexes of methanol with noble gas (NgHe, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, and Rn). Beside that, a parallel effort has been addressed to theoretically characterize the nature of intermolecular interactions determining the dissociation energy and equilibrium distance of the formed adducts. Dynamics and lifetime results reveal that, except for the CH<sub>3</sub>OH-He aggregate, all other methanol-Ng compounds are sufficiently stable under thermal conditions. Their lifetimes are larger than 1 ps for the temperature of the bulk in the range between 200 and 500 K. In addition, the current lifetime results suggest that the aggregates formed by methanol and Ng are globally more stable than corresponding complexes formed by water with Ng. From the point of view of the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level calculation, in all compounds, the electron densities of Ng partners are weakly polarized in the presence of CH<sub>3</sub>OH molecule. The charge-displacement curves and NBO analysis indicate that the charge transfer from Ng to methanol molecule, in general, plays a minor role, being appreciable only in the aggregate involving Ar. Finally, it was verified from the SAPT2 + (CCD)-δMP2/aug-cc-pVTZ calculations and NCI analysis that the dispersion is the essential long-range attractive contribution to the interaction energy for all studied complexes. This feature strongly suggests that these compounds are held bonded substantially by van der Waals forces. Then non-covalent intermolecular bonds are effectively formed in the gas phase, which is disturbed by small stabilizing charge-transfer contributions.},

This article evaluates the influence of carboxyl and amine substituting groups on the aggregation of coronene by performing a global optimization study based on a new potential energy surface. The structures of clusters with substituted coronene are similar to those formed by un-substituted monomers, that is, stacked (non-stacked) motifs are favoured for small-size (large-size) clusters. Nonetheless, the presence of carboxyl and amine groups leads to an increase of the number of local minima of comparable energy. The clusters with substituted monomers have also shown to enhance the attractive component interaction, which can be attributed to weak induction and charge transfer effects and to stronger electrostatic contributions. Moreover, the calculated height of magic-number structures of the clusters in this work is compatible with the morphology of the GQDs reported in the literature.},

It was developed and applied to reactions of Ne* atoms excited in their metastable <sup>3</sup>P<sub>J</sub> state, and here, its physical background is extensively described in order to provide a clear description of the microscopic phenomenon underlying the chemical reactivity of the oxidative processes under study. It overcomes theoretical models previously proposed and reproduces experimental results obtained in different laboratories. Two basic reaction mechanisms have been identified: (i) at low collision energies, a weakly bounded transition state is formed which spontaneously ionizes through a radiative physical mechanism (photoionization); (ii) in the hyperthermal regime, an elementary oxidation process occurs. In this paper, the selectivity of the electronic rearrangements triggering the two mechanisms has been related to the angular momentum couplings by Hund's cases, casting further light on fundamental aspects of the reaction stereodynamics of general interest.

 abstract = {Modifications in atomic alignment and in molecular alignment/orientation determine a different structure of the adduct, formed by collisions of reagents, which represents the precursor state of many elementary chemical–physical processes. The following evolution of the system is directly controlled by the confinement of interacting partners in such a precursor state. However, a deep characterization of these phenomena is still today not fully available, especially when weak intermolecular forces are operative, although the inquiry is of general relevance for the control of the stereodynamics of processes, occurring under a variety of conditions both in gas phase and at surface. In this paper recent advances in the knowledge of the selective role of atomic alignment and molecular orientation effects on the stereodynamics of chemi-ionization reactions will be presented and discussed. These advances represent a basic step along a path whose final target is the complete and internally consistent rationalization and revaluation of the experimental findings already obtained, and published, in our and in other laboratories on chemi-ionization reactions involving as reagent molecules which are of great relevance in several fields. The basic idea is to export important guidelines provided by a recent detailed study of chemi-ionization of noble gas atoms to more complex reactions involving molecules. The main focus of the present paper is on the quantum confinement effects of valence electrons within the reaction transition state.Graphic abstract},

 abstract = {<p> The role and nature of the weak intermolecular bond in the H <sub>2</sub> O <sub>2</sub> –noble gas enantiomeric conformations are presented. Charge transfer associated with the formation of a weak intermolecular hydrogen bond tends to stabilize the cis -barrier conformation. </p>
<p> In this work the role of the weak intermolecular interaction between the hydrogen peroxide molecule (H <sub>2</sub> O <sub>2</sub> ) and noble gas atoms Ng (Ng = He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe and Rn) was investigated. This is mainly important to determine the spectroscopic features of two-body interacting systems found in the bulk at temperatures confined in the thermal range. The stability of the formed adducts was inferred by their lifetimes evaluated as a function of temperature. The lifetime analysis suggests that only the H <sub>2</sub> O <sub>2</sub> –He complex is unstable in the 200–500 K temperature range. Moreover, exploiting the combination of several advanced theoretical methods, particular attention has been paid to characterizing the nature and anisotropy of the related intermolecular interaction, focusing our attention on the selected and representative conformations of the H <sub>2</sub> O <sub>2</sub> –Ng systems that were obtained in a previous study by our research group. Such conformations involve two basic structures of the enantiomeric H <sub>2</sub> O <sub>2</sub> moiety and the barriers between the two chiral structures. The interaction analysis was performed using Charge Displacement (CD), Natural Bond Orbitals (NBO), and Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT). For the selected conformations, it was observed that the polarization effects were more pronounced in complexes involving Xe and Rn atoms. CD analysis shows, especially in the cis -barrier conformation, a small but non-negligible charge transfer (CT) from Ng to H <sub>2</sub> O <sub>2</sub> , suggesting that the CT is enhanced by the two symmetrical interactions between the two hydrogens of H <sub>2</sub> O <sub>2</sub> and Ng. This stimulates the formation of a weak intermolecular hydrogen bond. The NBO analysis confirms the CD results, further showing that the largest electronic donation occurs from the valence lone pair orbitals of the Ng to the two O–H antibonding orbitals. The selectivity of CT is expected to appreciably reduce the adiabatic energy barrier height due to the torsional mode of the H <sub>2</sub> O <sub>2</sub> moiety within the complex, making the torsion slightly favored with respect to the case of the isolated molecule. Finally, SAPT and non-covalent interaction (NCI) analysis indicate that all systems are essentially van der Waals complexes, where the dispersion forces determine the most important attractive contribution to the interaction. </p>},

 abstract = {A new theoretical method, developed by our laboratory to describe the microscopic dynamics of gas-phase elementary chemi-ionization reactions, has been applied recently to study prototype atom-atom processes involving reactions between electronically excited metastable Ne*(<sup>3</sup>P<sub>2,0</sub>) and heavier noble gas atoms. Important aspects of electronic rearrangement selectivity have been emphasized that suggested the existence of two fundamental microscopic reaction mechanisms. The distinct mechanisms, which are controlled by intermolecular forces of chemical and noncovalent nature respectively, emerge under different conditions, and their balance depends on the collision energy regime investigated. The present paper provides the first step for the extension of the method to cases involving molecules of increasing complexity, whose chemi-ionization reactions are of relevance in several fields of basic and applied researches. The focus is here on the reactions of Ne* with simple inorganic molecules as Cl<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub>, and the application of the method discloses relevant features of the reaction microscopic evolution. In particular, this study shows that the balance of two fundamental reaction mechanisms depends not only on the collision energy and on the relative orientation of reagents but also on the orbital angular momentum of each collision complex. The additional insights so emphasized are of general relevance to assess in detail the stereodynamics of many other elementary processes.},

 abstract = {The scattering of CO molecules from a graphite surface has been characterized by exploiting molecular dynamics simulations, based on a chemical state-to-state semiclassical collisional method, and adopting a new reactive potential energy surface that considers the proper treatment of long-range noncovalent interactions promoting the physisorption. Carbon monoxide molecules impinge the surface in well-defined initial rotovibrational states and with the collision energy varying from subthermal up to hyperthermal values. The simulations predict that scattering events occur through both single- and multi-bounces and the initial vibrational state is preserved. In the multibounces instance, molecules tend to be trapped in the physisorption well, especially for collision energies lower than the thermal one. For medium–high collision energies, the scattering occurs mainly via a single-bounce mechanism. The heteronuclear character of the molecule brings out a new intriguing stereodynamic effect, in addition to those highlighted for homonuclear molecules: due to the anisotropic physisorption attraction, the molecule C-end bends toward the surface while approaching this latter. This effect produces evident propensities in the final rotational distributions of the CO scattered molecules.},

 abstract = {The Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Improved Lennard-Jones (ILJ) potential models have been deeply tested on the most accurate CCSD(T)/CBS electronic energies calculated for some weakly bound prototype systems. These results are important to plan the correct application of such models to systems at increasing complexity. CCSD(T)/CBS ground state electronic energies were determined for 21 diatomic systems composed by the combination of the noble gas atoms. These potentials were employed to calculate the rovibrational spectroscopic constants, and the results show that for 20 of the 21 pairs the ILJ predictions agree more effectively with the experimental data than those of the LJ model. The CCSD(T)/CBS energies were also used to determine the β parameter of the ILJ form, related to the softness/hardness of the interacting partners and controlling the shape of the potential well. This information supports the experimental finding that suggests the adoption of β≈9 for most of the systems involving noble gas atoms. The He-Ne and He-Ar molecules have a lifetime of less than 1ps in the 200-500 K temperature range, indicating that they are not considered stable under thermal conditions of gaseous bulks. Furthermore, the controversy concerning the presence of a "virtual" or a "real" vibrational state in the He2 molecule is discussed.},

Such potential energy surfaces, where the interaction exclusively arises from the anisotropic van der Waals interaction components, are given in an analytical form. Therefore, they can be easily used as force fields to carry out molecular simulations to evaluate spectroscopic features and the dynamical selectivity of weakly bound complexes formed by propylene oxide (a prototype chiral species) with a noble gas atom (a prototype isotropic partner) by two-body collisions under a variety of conditions. Several potential energy minima are identified on the surfaces, which are confirmed and characterized by high level ab initio calculations. The next step to further generalize this methodology is its extension to systems involving propylene oxide-diatomic molecules (as H2, O2 and N2), as well as to propylene oxide dimers.},

The experimental results can be interpreted by assuming the occurrence of a dominant reaction pathway leading to the two but-2-enedinitrile (1,2-dicyanothene) isomers (<i>E</i>- and <i>Z</i>-NC-CH═CH-CN) in a H-displacement channel and, to a much minor extent, to 1,1-dicyanoethene, CH<sub>2</sub>C(CN)<sub>2</sub>.

We have also estimated the rate coefficient at very low temperatures by employing a semiempirical method for the treatment of long-range interactions. The reaction has been found to be barrierless and fast also under the low temperature conditions of cold interstellar clouds and the atmosphere of Titan. Astrophysical implications and comparison with literature data are also presented.

 abstract = {Graphdiyne (GDY) has emerged as a very promising two-dimensional (2D) membrane for gas separation technologies. One of the most challenging goals is the separation of deuterium (D<sub>2</sub>) and tritium (T<sub>2</sub>) from a mixture with the most abundant hydrogen isotope, H<sub>2</sub>, an achievement that would be of great value for a number of industrial and scientific applications. In this work we study the separation of hydrogen isotopes in their transport through a GDY membrane due to mass-dependent quantum effects that are enhanced by the confinement provided by its intrinsic sub-nanometric pores. A reliable improved Lennard-Jones force field, optimized on accurate <i>ab initio</i> calculations, has been built to describe the molecule-membrane interaction, where the molecule is treated as a pseudoatom. The quantum dynamics of the molecules impacting on the membrane along a complete set of incidence directions have been rigorously addressed by means of wave packet calculations in the 3D space, which have allowed us to obtain transmission probabilities and, in turn, permeances, as the thermal average of the molecular flux per unit pressure. The effect of the different incidence directions on the probabilities is analyzed in detail and it is concluded that restricting the simulations to a perpendicular incidence leads to reasonable results. Moreover, it is found that a simple 1D model-using a zero-point energy-corrected interaction potential-provides an excellent agreement with the 3D probailities for perpendicular incidence conditions. Finally, D<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub> selectivities are found to reach maximum values of about 6 and 21 at ≈50 and 45 K, respectively, a feature due to a balance between zero-point energy and tunneling effects in the transport dynamics. Permeances at these temperatures are below recommended values for practical applications, however, at slightly higher temperatures (77 K) they become acceptable while the selectivities preserve promising values, particularly for the separation of tritium.},

The total and partial ionization cross sections for both investigated systems are presented and discussed in a comparative way. The comparison of the recorded data allows to point out similarities and differences on the collisional stereodynamics of Ne*(3P0,2)-HCl and Ne*(3P0,2)-HBr systems. In particular, an accurate characterization of the interaction potentials, which is mandatory for a comprehensive description of Ne*-HX (X = Cl and Br) reactive collisions, has been outlined. Such a theoretical analysis suggests that the formation of the proton transfer, NeH+, ions as well as of other possible product ions (i.e. HX+ and NeHX+, parent and associate ions, respectively) comes from reactivity that is selectively open along angular cones showing different orientation and acceptance. In particular, the performed analysis highlights that the proton transfer rearrangement reaction, which is open in both Ne*-HX autoionizing collision, is much more efficient for Ne*+HCl respect to Ne*+HBr autoionization. The present investigation points out that such an efficiency variation is related to the following crucial points: (i) the different charge distribution on HX+ ionic products, (ii) the balance between two distinct microscopic mechanisms that are operative in such processes (a pure physical-photoionization-indirect mechanism and a chemical-oxidation-direct mechanism), which are reactions of interest in combustion chemistry, plasma physics and chemistry, as well as in astrochemistry and for the chemistry of planetary ionospheres.},

For the first time from the publication of experimental results in the 70’s, we obtained theoretical results in agreement with experiments, even at room temperature. In the present work we extend the approach to better describe non-adiabatic V–E deactivation and include the evaluation of the role of the higher excited singlet N2O surface, characterized by new high quality ab initio calculations, to that of the triplet Π and Σ ones. Within this framework, we calculate V–T, V–E and the corresponding total vibrational relaxation rate coefficients for initial vibrational N2(v) quantum numbers up to v = 10 in a wide temperature range (200–10 000 K).

The appropriate treatment of the long-range interaction forces emphasized the crucial control exercised by the weakly bound precursor state on the stereo-dynamics of all basic elementary processes occurring at the gas-surface inter-phase. Molecular dynamics simulations have highlighted the role of vibrationally excited molecules in plasma dynamics. Indeed, N2 molecules, impinging the surface in low-medium vibrational levels, conserve the initial vibration state while are inelastically scattered, rotationally excited and translationally colder. Moreover, N2 molecules nascent from the atomic recombination on the surface have a fair probability of forming at very high vibrational levels, with a consistent part of reaction exothermicity transferred to the translational energy. Consequently, the surface induces a strong non-equilibrium condition, influencing directly the dynamics of processes occurring in the plasma bulk.},

 abstract = {<p>The detailed characterization of barrier-less chemi-ionization reactions provides unique-direct information on basic quantities determining the topology of their stereo-dynamics. The precursor state, formed by collisions of reagents, plays here an important role being coincident with the reaction transition state. All the features of such a state, as well as its structure and stability, are directly or indirectly controlled by intermolecular forces operative in each collision complex. Particular attention it must be focused on the selectivity of the orbital angular momentum, affecting the fate of each collision event at any collision energy. Moreover, the distance of the closest approach (turning point) of reagents, controls the relative weight of two different reaction mechanisms: i) An exchange mechanism triggered by strong chemical forces that act mainly at short separation distances, inducing an electron transfer between the reactants through a prototype oxidation process; ii) A radiative mechanism, caused by the combination of weak chemical and physical forces dominant at larger distances and which provokes an electron ejection via a pure photoionization event determined by the exchange of a &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; photon between the reacting partners. Obtained results are of great interest for many other elementary processes, difficult to characterize at the same level of detail. They suggest some limitations of the so called "capture models", usually exploited to describe many other barrier-less processes, like ion&ndash;molecule reactions, occurring in interstellar medium, planetary atmospheres and plasmas.</p>},

 abstract = {The inelastic scattering of N<sub>2</sub> molecules from silica surfaces, taken at 100 K, has been investigated by adopting a semiclassical collision model in conjunction with the appropriate treatment of the long-range interaction forces. Such forces promote the formation of the precursor state that controls all basic elementary processes occurring at the gas-surface interphase. The probabilities for the different elementary surface processes triggered by quartz are determined and compared with those recently obtained for another silica polymorph (cristobalite). In addition, the final roto-vibrational distributions of N<sub>2</sub> molecules undergoing inelastic scattering have been characterized. N<sub>2</sub> molecules, impinging on both considered surfaces in low-medium vibrational states, preserve the initial vibrational state, while those inelastically scattered are rotationally excited and translationally colder. The surface temperature effect, investigated by raising the temperature itself from 100 K up to 1000 K, emerges more sharply for the cristobalite polymorph, mainly for the molecules impinging in the ground roto-vibrational state and with low collision energies.},

 abstract = {This work presents a study involving dimers composed of He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn, and Og noble gases with oganesson, a super-heavy closed-shell element (<i>Z</i> = 118). He-Og, Ne-Og, Ar-Og, Kr-Og, Xe-Og, Rn-Og, and Og-Og ground state electronic potential energy curves were calculated based on the 4-component (4c) Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian and were counterpoise corrected. For the 4c calculations, the electron correlation was taken into account using the same methodology (MP2-srLDA) and basis set quality (Dyall's acv3z and Dunning's aug-cc-PVTZ). All calculations included quantum electrodynamics effects at the Gaunt interaction level. For all the aforementioned dimers the vibration energies, spectroscopic constants (<i>ω</i><sub>e</sub>, <i>ω</i><sub>e</sub><i>x</i><sub>e</sub>, <i>ω</i><sub>e</sub><i>y</i><sub>e</sub>, <i>α</i><sub>e</sub>, and <i>γ</i><sub>e</sub>), and lifetime as a function of the temperature (which ranged from 200 to 500 K) were also calculated. The obtained results suggest that the inclusion of quantum electrodynamics effects reduces the value of the dissociation energy of all hetero-nuclear molecules with a percentage contribution ranging from 0.48% (for the He-Og dimer) to 9.63% (for the Rn-Og dimer). The lifetime calculations indicate that the Og-He dimer is close to the edge of instability and that Ng-Og dimers are relatively less stable when the Gaunt correction is considered. Exploiting scaling laws that adopt the polarizability of involved partners as scaling factors, it has also been demonstrated that in such systems the interaction is of van der Waals nature (size repulsion plus dispersion attraction) and this permitted an estimation of dissociation energy and equilibrium distance in the Og-Og dimer. This further information has been exploited to evaluate the rovibrational levels in this symmetric dimer and to cast light on the macroscopic properties of condensed phases concerning the complete noble gas family, emphasizing some anomalies of Og.},

Here, an accurate internally consistent formulation of the Optical interaction potentials, obtained by the combined analysis of scattering and spectroscopic experimental findings, casts light on structure, energy and angular momentum couplings of the precursor (pre-reactive) state controlling the stereo-dynamics of prototypical chemi-ionization reactions. The closest approach (turning point) of reagents, is found to control the relative weight of two different reaction mechanisms: (i) A direct mechanism stimulated by exchange chemical forces mainly acting at short separation distances and high collision energy; (ii) An indirect mechanism, caused by the combination of weak chemical and physical forces dominant at larger distances, mainly probed at low collision energy, that can be triggered by a virtual photon exchange between reagents.},

 abstract = {This paper reports on the characterization of the stereo-dynamic controlling three different chemi-ionization reactions, recent objective of our study, since they participate to the balance of phenomena occurring in plasma, interstellar medium, planetary atmospheres, flames and lasers. The optical potential, obtained by a phenomenological method and defined in the whole space of the relative configurations of reagents, has been formulated in an accurate and internally consistent way for three different systems. Some cuts of the multidimensional potential, that asymptotically correlate with a specific fine level of the open shell atom and/or with a defined orientation of the molecular reagent, have been exploited in the present study to emphasize crucial features of the collision dynamics along selected entrance channels of the reactions. Consistently, basic quantities determining the topology of the reaction stereo-dynamics have been properly defined, emphasizing in the three cases relevant changes in the microscopic reaction evolution. Much attention focused on the selectivity of the orbital angular momentum, affecting each collision event at any chosen collision energy. It controls the relative weight of two different reaction mechanisms. The direct reaction mechanism is driven by short-range chemical forces, promoting, by direct electron transfer between reagents, a prototypical elementary oxidation reaction. The indirect mechanism, controlled by the combination of long-range chemical and physical forces, can be triggered by a virtual photon exchanged between reagents, promoting a sort of photo-ionization process. Obtained results and emphasized differences appear to be of general interest for many other elementary processes, more difficult to characterize at this level of detail.Graphic abstract},

 abstract = {The present perspective review focuses on the role of the precursor state, controlling the dynamical evolution of elementary processes, whose structure and stability are often difficult to characterize on quantitative grounds. In particular, such a state depends on the critical balance of weak intermolecular forces operative at long and intermediate separation distances. In this paper, a complementary problem has been properly addressed, concerning the suitable formulation of the intermolecular forces involved, defined in terms of a limited number of parameters and applicable in the whole space of the relative configurations of interacting partners. Important help to the solution of such a problem has been provided by the phenomenological method which adopts semi-empirical and empirical formulas to represent the basic features of the leading interaction components. Such formulas are defined in terms of a few parameters directly or indirectly related to the fundamental physical properties of the interacting partners. In this way, the basic features of the precursor state controlling its stability and its dynamical evolution have been defined in an internally consistent way for several elementary processes, having apparently different natures. Particular attention has been paid to the chemi-ionization reactions: they are treated as prototype oxidation processes for which all electronic rearrangements affecting stability and evolution of the precursor state, coincident with the reaction transition state, have been characterized in great detail. The obtained information appears to be in the perspective of general interest for many other elementary processes, difficult to investigate in the same detail since many other effects mask their basic features.},

 abstract = {Context and resultsThis work aims to study the influence of the absence and presence of permanent charges on the electronic and dynamical properties of the non-covalent bound diatomic systems involving He and Li, Be as neutral and ionic partners. The charge displacement results suggest that in the formation of HeLi+$$^{+}$$, HeBe+$$^{+}$$, and HeBe2+$$^{2+}$$, the neutral He atom undergoes, in the electric field of the ion, a pronounced electronic polarization, and the natural bond order theoretical approach indicates that in the formation of the molecular orbital He acts as a weak electron donor. The energy decomposition analysis provides the dispersion and induction components as the attractive leading terms controlling the stability of all systems, confirming that the formed bond substantially maintains a non-covalent nature which is also supported by the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) analysis. Finally, it was found that the HeLi and HeBe neutral systems are unstable under any condition, HeLi+$$^{+}$$ and HeBe+$$^{+}$$ ionic systems are stable below 317K and 138K, respectively, while the HeBe2+$$^{2+}$$ system becomes unstable only after 3045K.Computational and theoretical techniquesThe potential energy curves and interactions in all systems were studied theoretically based on coupled-cluster singles and doubles method with perturbative inclusion of triples CCSD(T) method with an aug-cc-pV5Z basis set.

The used synchrotron radiation is in the 25.0–45.0 eV photon energy range. Preliminary data are presented for the case of the double photoionization of allene molecules whose photoinduced decomposition highlights 8 different open two-body fragmentation channels and 3 three-body dissociations. For each investigated dissociation channels threshold energies, relative cross sections and the appearing energy for the allene (C3H4)2+ dication as a function of the photon energy have been measured. Based on a Monte Carlo trajectory simulation, the computational analysis of the PEPIPICO spectra experimentally collected which is still in progress allows the possible extraction of the kinetic energy released (KER) and the angular distributions for the final fragment ions.

Through this study, we understand how isotopes and noble gases affect the transition rates between chiral conformations of hydrogen peroxide. The findings indicate that muonium acts as a”catalyst” for chiral transition, providing an important ant-Arrhenius behavior controlled by tunneling through barriers, whereas deuterium and tritium have a preserving effect, that is their rates follow the canonical Arrhenius behavior.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT Methyl cyanide (CH3CN) is one of the most abundant and widely spread interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs). Several studies found that, in hot corinos, methyl cyanide and methanol abundances are correlated suggesting a chemical link, often interpreted as a synthesis of them on the interstellar grain surfaces. In this article, we present a revised network of the reactions forming methyl cyanide in the gas phase. We carried out an exhaustive review of the gas-phase CH3CN formation routes, propose two new reactions, and performed new quantum mechanics calculations of several reactions. We found that 13 of the 15 reactions reported in the databases KIDA and UDfA have incorrect products and/or rate constants. The new corrected reaction network contains 10 reactions leading to methyl cyanide. We tested the relative importance of those reactions in forming CH3CN using our astrochemical model. We confirm that the radiative association of CH3+ and HCN, forming CH3CNH+, followed by the electron recombination of CH3CNH+, is the most important CH3CN formation route in both cold and warm environments, notwithstanding that we significantly corrected the rate constants and products of both reactions. The two newly proposed reactions play an important role in warm environments. Finally, we found a very good agreement between the CH3CN predicted abundances with those measured in cold (∼10 K) and warm (∼90 K) objects. Unexpectedly, we also found a chemical link between methanol and methyl cyanide via the CH$_{3}^{+}$ ion, which can explain the observed correlation between the CH3OH and CH3CN abundances measured in hot corinos.},

 abstract = {This study concerns the importance of the precursor (or pre-reactive) state of elementary physicochemical processes whose basic features, as structure, stability, and trapping effect of reagents, are controlled by the balance of intermolecular forces that arise at long range and operate at intermediate and short separation distances. The detailed formulation of such forces, determining formation probability and dynamical evolution of the precursor state, is of relevance in molecular science and difficult to be treated by quantum chemistry. Such a problem has been tackled by us exploiting the phenomenological approach, which employs semi-empirical and empirical formulas to represent strength, range and angular dependence of the leading interaction components involved. In addition to the study of transport phenomena, part of the attention is addressed to chemi-ionization (or Penning ionization) reactions for which neutral reagents lead to atomic and/or molecular ions plus electrons as products. Chemi-ionizations are bimolecular processes occurring in several environments of interest, where a reagent is a species, formed in excited-metastable electronic states by collisions with energetic electrons or cosmic rays. For such reactions all crucial electronic rearrangements, affecting stability and evolution of the weakly bound precursor state, here coincident with the reaction transition state, are characterized with a high detail. The results of the present study are of interest for many other processes, whose precursor states and their relevant features are difficult to characterize, often masked by several other effects.Graphical abstract},

 abstract = {Using accurate methodologies, an extensive study was conducted to investigate the electronic, spectroscopic, dynamic, and thermodynamic properties of systems comprising noble gases (Ng) and oxygen atoms in low-lying electronic states derived from the Ng ( 1 S) + O ( 3 P) separated atom limits. Our target has been to obtain information complementary to that provided by previous important studies performed on such systems. The analysis of electronic energy decomposition indicates that Ng–O systems exhibit a significant non-covalent nature in the resulting bond. In terms of thermodynamics, the Ar–O and He–O systems demonstrate the highest and lowest propensity, respectively, for formation within 50–500 K. The populations of vibrational levels in the Ne–O, Ar–O, Kr–O, and Xe–O systems exhibit an inverted distribution as the temperature is increased from 50 K to room temperature and 500 K. This fact may serve as motivation for future experimental-theoretical studies, as they suggest that these systems may have possible technological applications in lasers.},

To reach this goal, we improved a mixed quantum-classical (MQC) dynamics approach by lifting the constraint of a Morse treatment of the vibrational wave function and intramolecular potential and permitting the use of more realistic and flexible representations. The new formulation has also allowed us to separately analyze the role of intra- and intermolecular potentials on the calculated rates and properties. <i>Ab initio</i> intramolecular potentials are indispensable for highly excited vibrational states, though the Morse potential still gives reasonable values up to <i>v</i> = 20. An accurate description of the long-range interaction and the van der Waals well is a requisite for the correct reproduction of qualitative and quantitative rate coefficients, particularly at low temperatures, making physically meaningful analytical representations still the best choice compared to currently available <i>ab initio</i> potential energy surfaces. These settings were used to directly compute the MQC rates corresponding to a large number of initial vibrational quantum numbers, and the missing intermediate values were predicted using a machine learning technique (<i>i.e.</i>, the Gaussian process regression approach). The obtained values are reliable in the wide temperature range employed and are therefore valuable data for many communities dealing with nonlocal thermal equilibrium conditions in different environments.},

In this contribution, our attention is mostly addressed to the role of long-range forces, determining the physisorption of gaseous molecules on the surface. Such forces, formulated in terms of the improved Lennard–Jones interaction potential model, control the formation of precursor or pre-reactive state that plays a crucial role in the dynamical evolution of molecules impinging on the surface in the range of low–intermediate collision kinetic energies. The study focuses on the collisions of H2, O2, N2 and CO, initially in their ground and excited vibro-rotational levels, on a graphite surface. The resulting dispersion coefficients, which control the capture of impinging molecules, are compared and found in good agreement with those available in the literature. New selectivity and peculiarities of scattered molecules, crucial to control the kinetics of elementary chemical processes occurring at the gas–surface interfaces under thermal and sub-thermal conditions, of interest in different applied fields, are highlighted.Graphic abstract},

 abstract = {Hydrogen storage by physisorption on carbon-based materials is limited by comparatively low adsorption energies. However, decoration of the carbon substrate with alkali, alkaline earth, or other metal atoms has been proposed as a means to enhance adsorption energies. The decoration affects also the stability of these materials since it makes them more stable and resilient in the repeated cycles of charge and discharge that would be required for a good material devoted to storage. We investigate hydrogen storage capacities of small polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) cations grown in ultracold helium nanodroplets by analyzing the ion abundances and stabilities. The observations are assessed with quantum chemical calculations and atomistic simulations. It is experimentally shown that the addition of an alkali ion significantly enhances the hydrogen adsorption of the studied PAHs, up to 25% over the bare PAH in the experimental conditions studied here, and the simulations confirm this general trend except for some minor residual discrepancies in the special stabilities (magic numbers). Several approaches to study larger and different PAH compounds are also proposed, and for all cases it is found that alkali decoration increases energy stability by more than 100%.},

 abstract = {This perspective review focuses on the results of an internally consistent study developed in the Perugia laboratory, centered on the fundamental interaction components that, at large intermolecular distances, determine the formation of weak intermolecular hydrogen (HB) and halogen (XB) bonds. This investigation exploits old and novel molecular beam scattering experiments involving several gaseous prototypical systems. In particular, we focus on the kinetic energy dependence of the total (elastic + inelastic) integral cross-sections. Of particular interest is the measure of quantum interference patterns in the energy dependence of cross-sections of targeted systems and their shift compared to that of known reference systems. We interpreted these findings as interaction energy stabilization components, such as charge transfer, σ-hole, and polar flattening, that emerge at intermediate separation distance ranges and selectively manifest for specific geometries of collision complexes. Another significant observable we discuss is the absolute value of the cross-section and its dependence on permanent multipole moments of the collisional partners. Specifically, we show how the spontaneous orientation of rotationally cold and polar molecules, due to the electric field gradient associated with the interaction between permanent multipole moments, can significantly modify the magnitude of the total cross-section, even at high values of the impact parameter. We are confident that the present results can help extend the force field formulation to various interacting systems and carry out molecular dynamics simulations under conditions of application interest.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT To understand the origin of interstellar molecules we rely on astrochemical models, the gas-phase networks of which contain ≥7000 reactions. However, just a tiny fraction of them have parameters derived in laboratory experiments. Theoretical quantum mechanical (QM) calculations can also provide this information. Unfortunately, sometimes theoretical predictions and experimental values disagree, as is the case for the paradigmatic reaction CH3OH + OH → CH3O + H2O. Both laboratory experiments and QM calculations found an unexpected increase in the rate coefficients with decreasing temperature. However, experimental and theoretical estimates of the rate coefficients diverge by up to two orders of magnitude at the low temperatures of interest in interstellar chemistry. This work aims to test whether astronomical observations can help untangle this confusing situation. To this end, we first carried out new QM calculations to derive the rate coefficients of the major destruction reaction of the methoxy radical, CH3O + H, and then we compared astronomical observations from the IRAM/NOEMA Large Programme SOLIS with astrochemical model predictions. Our new rate coefficient for the CH3O + H reaction is 5–10 times larger than that in the astrochemical data base KIDA in the 10–100 K range. When including the new methoxy destruction rate coefficients, the comparison between observations and model predictions favours the rate coefficients of the CH3OH + OH reaction from QM calculations. We conclude that QM calculations are an important alternative to laboratory experiments when it comes to the harsh conditions of interstellar objects and that astronomical observations can be used to constraint the rate coefficients of relevant reactions.},

 abstract = {Experimental and numerical studies were performed on the vibrational energy relaxation in shock-heated CO/N2/Ar mixtures. A laser absorption technique was applied to the time-dependent rovibrational temperature time-history measurements. The vibrational relaxation data of reflected-shock-heated CO were summarized at 1720-3230 K. In shock-tube experiments, the rotational temperature of CO quickly reached equilibrium, whereas a relaxation process was found in the time-dependent vibrational temperature. For the mixture with 1.0% CO and 10.0% N2, the vibrational excitation caused a decrease in the macroscopic thermodynamic temperature of the test gas. In the simulations, the state-to-state (StS) approach was employed, where the vibrational energy levels of CO and N2 are treated as pseudo-species. The vibrational state-specific inelastic rate coefficients of N2-Ar collisions were calculated using the mixed quantum-classical method based on a newly developed three-dimensional potential energy surface. The StS predictions agreed well with the measurements, whereas deviations were found between the Schwartz-Slawsky-Herzfeld formula predictions and the measurements. The Millikan-White vibrational relaxation data of the N2-Ar system were found to have the most significant impact on the model predictions via sensitivity analysis. The vibrational relaxation data of the N2-Ar system were then modified according to the experimental data and StS results, providing an indirect way to optimize the vibrational relaxation data of a specific system. Moreover, the vibrational distribution functions of CO and N2 and the effects of the vibration-vibration-translation energy transfer path on the thermal nonequilibrium behaviors were highlighted.},

@article{pub.1173537545,
 abstract = {Silicon is one of the most abundant elements in the universe, and it is predominantly stored in the cores of dust grains, meteoroids, and meteorites in the form of silicates and carbides. When intense shocks occur, besides being released in the interstellar medium (ISM) as gaseous SiO and its isotopologues, silicon can be set free in its elemental form, ready to further react [e.g., 1, 2]. Relevant to this study, SiS has been detected in few astronomical environments: the interstellar shocked regions of L1157-B1, associated with an outflow driven by a low-mass protostar, and of the massive star-forming regions Sgr B2, and Orion KL, in addition to the envelopes of C-rich evolved stars [e.g., 3, 4]. Whilst the aspects related to the formation and destruction of SiO have been deeply investigated, those regarding SiS have not been clarified yet. The current available databases involving molecular kinetics (e.g. KIDA1, UMIST2), indeed report a single reaction pathway representing the SiS formation (HSiS+ + e- → H + SiS), leaving a plethora of potential channels to be investigated. Regarding the formation of SiS starting from Si+ via the HSiS+/SiSH+ ionic channel, many aspects are not fully clarified, and existing data in the literature is uncertain or missing. SiSH+ could be formed starting from Si+ through the reaction with OCS (to give SiS+ + CO) and subsequently with H2. However, the SiS+ + H2 → H + SiSH+ reaction seems unlikely [5]. H2S, which is detected also in shocked regions along with SiS [6], could also react with Si+ leading to HSiS+/SiSH+. Such a reaction pathway is not reported in KIDA or UMIST databases, despite H2S is expected to be released from the grains in the shocked regions where also SiS is detected. The formation of SiS from HSiS+/SiSH+ occurs through a proton transfer reaction towards an acceptor (e.g. NH3). In the present work, we aim to investigate the chemistry behind the Si+ + H2S reaction as a relevant ionic pathway to the formation of SiS and to generate new information available for the current reaction networks. To do so, we report both experimental and theoretical results, i.e. the rate constant, the absolute reactive cross section, and the branching ratios for the investigated ion-molecule reaction. The experiments were performed by using a Guide Ion Beam Mass Spectrometer (GIB-MS) with an O1-Q1-O2-Q2 configuration. The ions are generated in the source by electron impact ionization and then cooled and guided through the first octupole (O1) and quadrupole (Q1) to the collision cell, a second octopole (O2), where the neutral gas is injected and the reaction occurs. The products are then mass-filtered through the second quadrupole (Q2) and finally detected. The observables retrieved from this experiment are the branching ratios for the several reaction channels, the absolute reactive cross section for the investigated chemical reaction, and its trend as a function of the collision energy. The theoretical investigation was carried out combining high level ab initio calculations and statistical analysis. In details, electronic structure calculations on the doublet potential energy surface (PES) were performed at the coupled-cluster (CCSD(T)) level of theory, for both geometry optimization and harmonic vibrational frequencies calculations. On the basis of the derived PES, a kinetic investigation was performed adopting a combination of Capture theory and Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory, in order to derive branching fractions and channel specific rate constants. For the Si+ + H2S system, the observed reaction channels were the formation of SiSH+ + H and SiS+ + H2. The SiSH+ formation channel is observed to be the main one, in agreement with the theoretical results. Between the two possible SiSH+/HSiS+isomers, SiSH+ is the only one expected to form due to the endothermicity of the channel bringing to HSiS+.References[1] Bachiller, R. et al.

@article{pub.1173538044,
 abstract = {Methyl cyanide (a.k.a. acetonitrile) is a molecule of great astrochemical interest as it is one of the simplest interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs) routinely detected in young solar analogues. It has been observed in Class 0 and I hot-corinos (e.g. Taquet et al. 2015, Yang et al. 2021, Bianchi et al. 2022, Ceccarelli et al. 2024), in shocked regions (e.g., Codella et al. 2009), as well as in planet-forming disks (Öberg et al. 2015, Bergner et al. 2018, Loomis et al. 2018, 2020, Ilee et al. 2021). Moreover, CH3CN has been detected in comets, including towards 67/P Churyumov-Gerasimenko in the context of the ESA-Rosetta mission (Le Roy et al. 2015; Altwegg et al. 2019). Nitriles have a strong prebiotic relevance, as they act as intermediates in the formation of biomolecules, by reacting with water and participating in multi-step synthesis of amino acids/RNA precursors (e.g. Sutherland 2017). Hence the presence of nitriles and water in comets, with CH3CN ranging from ~0.008 to 0.054% with respect to water (Biver & Bockelée-Morvan 2019), is particularly interesting, and makes CH3CN a key species to explore the "chemical" connections between disks and comets. However, for such comparison to be meaningful, reaction rates and branching fractions for CH3CN formation and destruction pathways should be updated.The network of gas-phase formation routes of CH3CN has been revised and extended recently (Giani et al. 2024), and here we focus on its destruction routes by collisions with energetic ions H+, H3+, HCO+ and He+. While the reactions of H3+ and HCO+ lead to non-dissociative proton transfer (see experiments cited in KIDA and UMIST databases) giving CH3CNH+ (from which methyl cyanide can be regenerated by recombination with electrons or proton transfer to NH3), reactions with H+ and He+ are mostly destructive, due to the large exothermicity of the charge exchange process, equal to 12.39 eV in the He+ case. Therefore, collisions with He+ are an important pathway for the decomposition of iCOMs, as demonstrated previously for CH3OCH3, HCOOCH3 and CH3OH (Cernuto et al. 2017, Cernuto et al. 2018, Ascenzi et al 2019, Richardson et al. 2022). For CH3CN, while the reaction with H+ has been experimentally studied (Smith et al. 1992, see the KIDA and UMIST databases), no previous experimental or theoretical studies have been carried out for He+, and the rates reported in the astrochemical databases refer to expectations from capture theories.By applying a combined experimental and theoretical approach, we have developed the Potential Energy Surface for He+ plus CH3CN (L. Mancini et al. 2024) and we have used it to model the dynamics of the charge exchange process, by determining cross sections and branching ratios in a wide range of collision energies, from which rate constants at varying temperatures can be obtained. The electron capture is expected to occur from an inner valence orbital of CH3CN, leaving the radical cation in a highly excited electronic state leading to complete fragmentation. The main detected ionic fragments are HC2N+/C2NH+, CH2+ and HCNH+, quite different from those proposed in KIDA/UMIST databases (CH3+ and CN+), and the rate constant at T=10 K is 4.6x10-9 cm3molec-1s-1, to be compared with values of 4.5x10-8 and 1.3x10-8 cm3molec-1s-1 from KIDA and UMIST databases, respectively.Previous astrochemical models suggested that CH3CN in disks is mostly formed on grains, because gas-phase chemistry cannot account for the large observed abundances (Öberg et al. 2015, Loomis et al. 2018). These studies compared the abundance ratios of CH3CN with smaller N-bearing compounds (e.g. HCN, HC3N) in disks and in comets to test the inheritance of disk material into the forming planets and small bodies. Our experiments, however, indicate that the rate coefficient for the destruction of CH3CN through collisions with He+ might be almost one order of magnitude lower than what previously reported. Combined with the revised chemical network for formation of CH3CN (Giani et al. 2024), this may suggest that CH3CN in disks is mostly a gas-phase product. The formation of abundant CH3CN in gas-phase would explain why this molecule is routinely detected in planet-forming disks out to large radii (a few hundred of au), in contrast with CH3OH, which is only formed on grains, hence only detected where grains are sublimated, i.e. in the inner disk region. Our findings are thus expected to have important implications on the origin of methyl cyanide in planet-forming disks, as well as on the comparison of the abundance ratios of N-bearing molecules with cometary abundance ratios.ReferencesAltwegg K., Balsiger H. et al.
