 abstract = {This paper presents an overview of the analysis and measurements of equilibrium radiation obtained in NASA Ames Research Center’s Electric Arc Shock Tube facility as a part of recent testing aimed at reaching shock velocities up to 15.5 km/s. The goal of these experiments was to measure the level of radiation encountered during high-speed Earth entry conditions, such as would be relevant for an asteroid, interplanetary, or lunar return mission. These experiments provided the first spectrally and spatially resolved data for high-speed Earth entry and cover conditions ranging from 9.5 to 15.5 km/s at 13.3 and 26.6 Pa (0.1 and 0.2 torr). The present analysis endeavors to provide a detailed comparison of shock tube radiation measurements and simulations at high-speed conditions. A comprehensive comparison between the spectrally resolved absolute equilibrium radiance measured in the Electric Arc Shock Tube facility and NASA’s predictive tools is presented. To provide a more accurate representation of the agreement between the experimental and simulation results, the integrated value of radiance is compared across four spectral regions (vacuum ultraviolet, ultraviolet/ visible, visible/ near infrared, and infrared) as a function of velocity. Results have generally shown excellent agreement between the two codes and the shock tube data for the ultraviolet through infrared spectral regions; however, discrepancies have been identified in the vacuum ultraviolet. As a result of the analysis presented in this paper, an updated parametric uncertainty for high-speed radiation in air is evaluated to be [9.0%, −6.3%]. Furthermore, due to the nature of the radiating environment at these high shock speeds, initial calculations aimed at modeling phenomena that become more significant with increasing shock speed are performed. These phenomena include analyzing the radiating species emitting ahead of the shock and the increased significance of radiative cooling mechanisms.},

 abstract = {The objective of this study was to introduce and demonstrate a computationally efficient, multistep uncertainty quantification approach for high-fidelity, hypersonic reentry flow simulations, which may include large numbers of aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. The multistep uncertainty quantification approach included several key components, including a sensitivity-based dimension reduction process that used a local sensitivity analysis at selected sample locations to approximate global sensitivities. Other components included a method to update existing deterministic samples after dimension reduction and a modified point-collocation nonintrusive polynomial chaos method that incorporates existing local sensitivity information. The multistep uncertainty quantification approach was demonstrated on two model problems. The first was a model for stagnation point convective heat transfer in hypersonic flow. Mixed uncertainty quantification analysis results in reduced dimensions compared well with Monte Carlo simulations. The second problem was a high-fidelity, computational fluid dynamics model for stagnation point radiative heat flux on a Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator during a Mars entry. The model consisted of 93 uncertain parameters, coming from both flowfield and radiation modeling. The model was reduced to ten and five uncertain variables, accounting for 95 and 90% of the total output variance, respectively. Pure aleatory, epistemic, and mixed uncertainty quantification analyses were in agreement with previous work, proving the potential and applicability of the multistep uncertainty quantification process for complex hypersonic reentry flow models.},

 abstract = {A three-dimensional ray-tracing algorithm is developed for shock-layer radiative heating predictions. When coupled with a tangent slab approximate code, such as the HARA radiation code, this algorithm provides an efficient approach for computing the radiative heating and allows the commonly applied tangent slab approximation to be removed. Application to several Earth- and Mars-entry conditions show that the ray-tracing approach predicts up to 15% lower radiative heating values than the tangent slab approximation at the stagnation point, which is consistent with the results of previous studies. In the afterbody region of Mars entry vehicles, where radiative heating from the CO2 molecule may be larger than convective heating, a 70% reduction from the tangent-slab result is seen, indicating the inadequacy of the tangent slab approximation in such regions.},

 abstract = {This work develops a chemical kinetic rate model for simulating nonequilibrium radiation from CO2–N2 gases, representative of Mars or Venus entry shock layers. Using recent EAST shock tube measurements of nonequilibrium CO 4th Positive and CN Violet emission at pressures and velocities ranging from 0.10 to 1.0Torr and 6 to 8km/s, the rate model is developed through an optimization procedure that minimizes the disagreement between the measured and simulated nonequilibrium radiance profiles. Only the dissociation rates of CO2, CO, and NO, along with the CN + O and CO + N rates were treated as unknown in this optimization procedure, as the nonequilibrium radiance was found to be most sensitive to them. The other rates were set to recent values from the literature. Increases in over a factor of 5 in the CO dissociation rate relative to the previous widely used value were found to provide the best agreement with measurements, while the CO2 rate was not changed. The developed model is found to capture the measured nonequilibrium radiance of CO 4th Positive and CN Violet within error bars of ±30%.},

@article{pub.1022870477,
 abstract = {Radiative heating is identified as a major contributor to afterbody heating for Earth entry capsules at velocities above 10  km/s. Because of rate-limited electron–ion recombination processes, many of the electronically excited N and O atoms produced in the high-temperature/pressure forebody remain as they expand into the afterbody region, which results in significant afterbody radiation. Large radiative heating sensitivities to electron-impact ionization rates and escape factors are identified. Ablation products from a forebody ablator are shown to increase the afterbody radiation by nearly 40%, due to the influence of CO on the vibrational-electronic temperature. The tangent-slab radiation transport approach is shown to overpredict the radiative flux by as much as 50% in the afterbody, therefore making the more computationally expensive ray-tracing approach necessary for accurate radiative flux predictions. For the Stardust entry, the afterbody radiation is predicted to be nearly twice as large as the convective heating during the peak heating phase of the trajectory. Comparisons between simulations and the Stardust Echelle observation measurements, which are shown to be dominated by afterbody emission, indicate agreement within 20% for various N and O lines. Similarly, calorimeter measurements from the Fire II experiment are identified as a source of validation data for afterbody radiation. For the afterbody calorimeter measurement closest to the forebody, which experiences the largest afterbody radiative heating component, the fully catalytic convective heating prediction alone is shown to underpredict the measurement by up to 60%. Agreement with the measurements is improved to within 20% with the addition of afterbody radiation. These comparisons with Stardust and Fire II measurements confirm that afterbody radiation is a valid heating mechanism that requires consideration in future vehicle designs.},

 abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the uncertainty in shock layer radiative heating predictions on the surface of a hypersonic inflatable aerodynamic decelerator during Titan entry at peak radiative heating conditions. Computational fluid dynamics simulations of planetary entry flows and radiative heating predictions possess a significant amount of uncertainty due to the complexity of the flow physics and the difficulty in obtaining accurate experimental results of molecular-level phenomena. Sources of uncertainty considered include flowfield chemical rate models, molecular band emission, and the excitation/deexcitation rates of molecules modeled with a non-Boltzmann approach. Because of the computational cost of the numerical models, uncertainty quantification was performed with a surrogate modeling approach based on a sparse approximation of the point-collocation nonintrusive polynomial chaos expansion. Accurate uncertainty results were obtained with only 500 evaluations of the computational model. Results showed that epistemic uncertainty intervals of surface radiative heating predictions were as wide as 150 W/cm2 during Titan entry, indicating the significant effect of uncertainty. A global nonlinear sensitivity analysis showed that the top uncertainty source contributing to the uncertainty in radiative heating was the flowfield chemistry modeling throughout the shock layer.},

 abstract = {The Mars Science Laboratory heat shield was designed to withstand a fully turbulent heat pulse using information from ground testing and computational analysis on a preflight design trajectory. Instrumentation on the flight heat shield measured in-depth temperatures to permit reconstruction of the surface heating. The data indicate that boundary-layer transition occurred at five of seven measurement locations before peak heating. Data oscillations at three pressure measurement locations may also indicate transition. This paper presents the heat shield temperature and pressure data, possible explanations for the timing of boundary-layer transition, and a comparison of reconstructed and computational heating on the actual trajectory. A smooth-wall boundary-layer Reynolds number that was used to predict transition is compared with observed transition at various heat shield locations. A single transition Reynolds number criterion does not uniformly explain the timing of boundary-layer transition observed during flight. A roughness-based Reynolds number suggests that transition due to discrete or distributed roughness elements occurred. However, the distributed roughness height from acreage heat shield material would have needed to be larger than expected. The instrumentation confirmed the predicted location of maximum turbulent heat flux near the lee-side shoulder. The reconstructed heat flux at that location is bounded by smooth-wall turbulent convective heating, indicating that a significant augmentation due to surface roughness did not occur. Turbulent heating on the downstream side of the heat shield nose exceeded smooth-wall convective levels, assuming a supercatalytic surface, indicating that roughness may have augmented heating. The stagnation region heating also exceeded calculated convective heating; the cause of elevated heating may be attributed to a combination of shock-layer radiation and a heating augmentation of unknown origin that was also evident in ground test data.},

 abstract = {This paper presents an overview of the analysis and measurements of equilibrium radiation obtained in the NASA Ames Research Center’s Electric Arc Shock Tube facility as part of testing for the multipurpose crew vehicle. These experiments were aimed at measuring the level of radiation encountered during conditions relevant to lunar return into Earth’s atmosphere. Subsequently, the targeted testing conditions ranged from 8 to 12  km/s and 0.1 to 1.0 torr (13.3 to 133 Pa). A comprehensive comparison between the spectrally resolved absolute radiance measured in the Electric Arc Shock Tube facility and the predictive tools (NEQAIR and HARA), is presented. To provide a more accurate representation of the uncertainty, the current predictive capability has been calculated as a function of velocity. The results of the analysis have shown that both models underpredict the experimental data at lower shock speeds (less than 10  km/s), with the agreement improving with increasing shock speed. At shocks speeds greater than ∼10  km/s, the agreement between the codes and the experiment is within one standard deviation in the scatter of the experimental result. Discrepancies at lower speeds have been attributed to a higher than equilibrium level of electron number density in the Electric Arc Shock Tube flow. Furthermore, power law coefficients characterizing the radiance versus the velocity relationship measured in the Electric Arc Shock Tube are presented for ease of conducting future experimental and computational comparisons.},

 abstract = {This paper presents measurements and simulations of CO 4th Positive equilibrium radiation obtained in the NASA Ames Research Center's Electric Arc Shock Tube (EAST) facility. The experiments were aimed at measuring the level of radiation encountered during conditions relevant to high-speed entry into a simulated Martian atmosphere (96% CO2: 4% N2). The facility was configured to target several ranges of nominal Mars entry conditions, of which 7.35km/s at 0.1Torr (13.3Pa), 6.2–8km/s at 0.25Torr (33Pa) and 7.1–7.8km/s at 1Torr (133Pa) are examined in this paper. The CO 4th Positive system was chosen to be the focus of this study as it accounts for a large percentage of the emitted radiation for Martian entry, and also due to the difficulties of obtaining experimental validation data due to the emission appearing in the Vacuum Ultra Violet (VUV) spectral range. The focus of this paper is to provide a comprehensive comparison between the EAST data and various CO 4th Positive databases available in the literature. The analysis endeavors to provide a better understanding of the uncertainty in the measurements and quantifies the level of agreement found between simulations and experimental data. The results of the analysis show that the magnitude of the CO 4th Positive radiative intensity is very sensitive to the flow temperature. Subsequently, simulations using thermodynamic equilibrium generally under-predict the experimental data by approximately a factor of up to 2. However, when simulations are performed using a flow temperature extracted from the black body limited portion of the CO 4th Positive spectra taken from experiment, the agreement between the EAST data and simulations is generally very good. Furthermore, comparisons of experimental data and simulations across other spectral regions provide additional support for the use of the black body temperature.},

 abstract = {The objective of this work was to perform sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification for afterbody radiative heating predictions of the Stardust capsule during Earth entry at peak afterbody radiation conditions. The radiation environment in the afterbody region poses significant challenges for accurate uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis due to the complexity of the flow physics, computational cost, and large number of uncertain variables. In this study, first a sparse collocation nonintrusive polynomial chaos approach along with global nonlinear sensitivity analysis was used to identify the most significant uncertain variables and reduce the dimensions of the stochastic problem. Then, a total-order stochastic expansion was constructed over only the important parameters for an efficient and accurate estimate of the uncertainty in radiation. Based on previous work, 388 uncertain parameters were considered in the radiation model, which came from the thermodynamics, flowfield chemistry, and radiation modeling. The sensitivity analysis showed that only four of these variables contributed significantly to afterbody radiation uncertainty, accounting for almost 95% of the uncertainty. These included the electronic-impact excitation rate for N between level 2 and level 5 and rates of three chemical reactions influencing N, N+, O, and O+ number densities in the flowfield.},

@article{pub.1060751250,
 abstract = {This work addresses the study of the behavior of the excited electronic states of CO molecules in the nonequilibrium relaxation zone behind a normal shock for a CO2-N2 mixture representative of the Mars atmosphere. The hybrid state-to-state (StS) model developed accounts for thermal nonequilibrium between the translational energy mode of the gas and the vibrational energy mode of individual molecules. The electronic states of CO molecules are treated as separate species, allowing for non-Boltzmann distributions of their populations. The StS model is coupled with a nonequilibrium radiation solver, hpc-rad, allowing for the calculation of the radiation signature from the molecular and atomic species in the gas. This study focuses on the radiation from the fourth positive system of CO, which dominates the radiation heating on the forebody for higher speed Mars entry applications. In the rapidly dissociating regime behind strong shock waves, the population of the ground electronic state of CO [CO(X1Σ)], departs from Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions, owing to the efficient collisional excitation to the electronically excited CO(A1Π) state. In general the assumption of the equilibrium between electronic and vibration fails when the excitation of electronic states is driven by heavy particles. The comparison of the radiation heating predictions obtained using the conventional quasi-steady-state (QSS) approach and the physics-based StS approach revealed differences in radiative heating predictions of up to 50%. These results demonstrate that the choice of nonequilibrium model can have a significant impact on radiative heating simulations, and more importantly, they cast serious doubts on the validity of the QSS assumption for the condition of interest to this work.},

 abstract = {A novel reduced-order method is presented for modeling reacting flows characterized by strong non-equilibrium of the internal energy level distribution of chemical species in the gas. The approach seeks for a reduced-order representation of the distribution function by grouping individual energy states into macroscopic bins, and then reconstructing state population using the maximum entropy principle. This work introduces an adaptive grouping methodology to identify and lump together groups of states that are likely to equilibrate faster with respect to each other. To this aim, two algorithms have been considered: the modified island algorithm and the spectral clustering method. Both methods require a measure of dissimilarity between internal energy states. This is achieved by defining "metrics" based on the strength of the elementary rate coefficients included in the state-specific kinetic mechanism. Penalty terms are used to avoid grouping together states characterized by distinctively different energies. The two methods are used to investigate excitation and dissociation of N<sub>2</sub> (Σg+1) molecules due to interaction with N(Su4) atoms in an ideal chemical reactor. The results are compared with a direct numerical simulation of the state-specific kinetics obtained by solving the master equations for the complete set of energy levels. It is found that adaptive grouping techniques outperform the more conventional uniform energy grouping algorithm by providing a more accurate description of the distribution function, mole fraction and energy profiles during non-equilibrium relaxation.},

 abstract = {The present paper discusses the development of a margin policy for radiative heating during lunar return Earth reentry. The approach starts with stagnation line radiance predictions, for which significant validation data are available, and follows a mathematical formalism to translate the uncertainty in radiance prediction to an uncertainty in radiative heating. The analysis accounts for uncertainties in equilibrium and nonequilibrium radiance, angular integration, boundary-layer absorption, and flowfield–radiation coupling. Uncertainties based on parametric analyses are then reduced through Bayesian inference against experimental data. Terms are introduced to account for the neglect of ablation products and trace air species. The impact is then assessed through analysis of candidate entry trajectories. The major contributors to margin are uncertainty in equilibrium radiation parameters, nonequilibrium radiation, and neglect of trace species.},

 abstract = {A hypersonic flowfield model that treats electronic levels of the dominant afterbody radiator N as individual species is presented. This model allows electron-ion recombination rate and two-temperature modeling improvements, the latter which are shown to decrease afterbody radiative heating by up to 30%. This decrease is primarily due to the addition of the electron-impact excitation energy-exchange term to the energy equation governing the vibrational-electronic electron temperature. This model also allows the validity of the often applied quasi-steady-state (QSS) approximation to be assessed. The QSS approximation is shown to fail throughout most of the afterbody region for lower electronic states, although this impacts the radiative intensity reaching the surface by less than 15%. By computing the electronic-state populations of N within the flowfield solver, instead of through the QSS approximation in the radiation solver, the coupling of nonlocal radiative transition rates to the species continuity equations becomes feasible. Implementation of this higher-fidelity level of coupling between the flowfield and radiation solvers is shown to increase the afterbody radiation by up to 50% relative to the conventional model.},

 abstract = { A high-fidelity approach for simulating the aerothermodynamic environments of meteor entries was developed, which allows the commonly assumed heat transfer coefficient of 0.1 to be assessed. This model uses chemically reacting computational fluid dynamics (CFD), coupled with radiation transport and surface ablation. Coupled radiation accounts for the impact of radiation on the flowfield energy equations, while coupled ablation explicitly models the injection of ablation products within the flowfield and radiation simulations. For a meteoroid with a velocity of 20 km/s, coupled radiation is shown to reduce the stagnation point radiative heating by over 60%. The impact of coupled ablation (with coupled radiation) is shown to provide at least a 70% reduction in the radiative heating relative to cases with only coupled radiation. This large reduction is partially the result of the low ionization energies of meteoric ablation products relative to air species. The low ionization energies of ablation products, such as Mg and Ca, provide strong photoionization and atomic line absorption in regions of the spectrum that air species do not. MgO and CaO are also shown to provide significant absorption. Turbulence is shown to impact the distribution of ablation products through the shock-layer, which results in up to a 100% increase in the radiative heating downstream of the stagnation point. To create a database of heat transfer coefficients, the developed model was applied to a range of cases. This database considered velocities ranging from 14 to 20 km/s, altitudes ranging from 20 to 50 km, and nose radii ranging from 1 to 100 m. The heat transfer coefficients from these simulations are below 0.045 for the range of cases, for both laminar and turbulent, which is significantly lower than the canonical value of 0.1. When the new heat transfer model is applied to a Tunguska-like 15 Mt entry, the effect of the new model is to lower the height of burst by up to 2 km, depending on assumed entry angle. This, in turn, results in a significantly larger ground damage footprint than when the canonical heating assumption is used.},

 abstract = {For coupled flowfield–radiation simulations, required for Earth entry at velocities greater than 10 km/s, tangent-slab radiative transport is shown to sufficiently model the divergence of the radiative flux (this term couples the radiative energy to the flowfield energy equations). However, as shown in previous studies, the tangent-slab approximation does not sufficiently model the radiative flux reaching the surface (i.e., the radiative heating). These conclusions are reached through the development of a detailed ray-tracing approach capable of computing both the divergence of the radiative flux and the radiative heating. This approach is orders of magnitude more computationally expensive than the tangent-slab approximation. The ability of the tangent-slab approach to accurately model the divergence of the radiative flux, but not the radiative heating, is shown to be the result of a cancellation of errors during the angular integration. The current work shows that combining the tangent-slab approximation for the divergence of the radiative flux with the ray-tracing approach for the radiative heating (as a final step) provides sufficiently accurate results (radiative heating values within 1%), in an efficient manner, for coupled flowfield–radiation problems.},

GLM positions and timings are sufficiently accurate to assist in trajectory and orbit reconstruction. GLM samples the light curve nearly completely, unaffected by onboard and downlink processes tailored to lightning data. Sufficient data on the instantaneous background scene are provided to reconstruct the baseline drift in the brightest pixels. The agreement to within a factor of 2–3 between measured total radiated energy from GLM and that derived from other space‐borne observations implies that during the bolide's peak brightness the GLM pass band is dominated by continuum emission, rather than O I line emission. The reported flux is corrected for angle‐from‐nadir shifts in the central wavelength of the pass band, which overestimates continuum flux by only up to 20% for most of the GLM field of view, but more so if the bolide is observed far from nadir. Assuming a 6000 K blackbody spectrum, GLM is able to detect bolides with peak visual magnitude (at a normalized 100 km distance) brighter than about −14 in nighttime, and slightly brighter in daytime. },

 abstract = {This paper develops a model for simulating the radiative flux reaching the ground originating from a meteor shock-layer and wake. The area of radiant burn measured for the Tunguska event provides a test case for the developed model. This model applies recently developed computational fluid dynamic simulations, which include the impact of ablation and radiation on the shock-layer flowfield, and ray-tracing radiation transport with atmospheric absorption. The impact of the meteor view angle is shown to significantly impact the radiative flux. Looking at the meteor along the flight path (head-on) results in lower radiative heating because it reduces the wake field of view, where the large radiating wake is shown to provide a significant contribution to the radiative flux (when viewed from the side). The impact of ablation on the ground radiative flux is negligible because the ablation products are limited to the optically-thick core of the wake. The resulting simulated radiative flux values are correlated as a function of velocity, altitude, view angle, and meteoroid radius. This correlation is then applied to potential Tunguska entry trajectories to provide a simulated ground heating footprint. Comparing this simulated footprint with the measured radiant burn area provides a metric for assessing unknown Tunguska entry parameters. Using this approach, the initial radius resulting in good agreement with the measured radiant burn footprint was found for a range of maximum debris cloud radii, entry angles, and velocities. The resulting optimal initial radii were between 30 and 45 m for the entire range of cases considered. This provides a valuable constraint on initial radius for complementary Tunguska studies, such as blast-wave simulations that aim to reproduce the tree-fall pattern.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a physics-based reduced-order model for describing vibrational non-equilibrium in CO2 flows. The use of the coarse grain approach, which entails grouping individual internal states together into macroscopic bins, allows a dramatic reduction in computational costs while retaining key information from the full state-to-state model. The accuracy of the current model reduction methodology is further improved by utilizing state-specific kinetics to determine an optimal strategy for dividing states into bins. The time-evolution of CO2 under strong thermal and chemical non-equilibrium in an ideal chemical reactor is studied using both the full vibrational state-to-state model and the resultant coarse grain-based reduced-order models. The developed reduced-order model successfully reproduces the internal population distribution and other macroscopic quantities of interest while providing a nearly three order of magnitude speedup. The new modeling framework is used to investigate the flowfield and radiative heating during atmo-spheric entry for the Mars 2020 mission. Predictions for the forebody region match results obtained using conventional multi-temperature models. However, the two approaches yield significantly different estimates for the CO2 vibrational state distribution and infrared radiation in the backshell region.},

 abstract = {The current work presents a computationally tractable simulation methodology combining different model-reduction techniques for resolving non-Boltzmann thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, and radiative transfer in complex three-dimensional flows. The empiricism associated with conventional multitemperature nonequilibrium models is abandoned in favor of the multigroup maximum entropy method combined with kinetics-informed adaptive binning. This group-based approach allows for time-varying optimal reduced-order representation of the internal state population distribution while accounting for all collisional processes included in the state-to-state model. Similarly, radiative transfer calculations are performed efficiently by discretization in the spectral, angular, and spatial spaces using the smeared band, discrete ordinate, and finite-volume methods, respectively. This reduction in computational overhead allows truly non-Boltzmann simulations with two-way coupling between the flow and radiation fields to be realized without simplifying approximations based on the tangent-slab method or local escape-factors. The simulation procedure is used in conjunction with the US3D flow solver to investigate the impact of vibrational nonequilibrium on CO2 wake flows and resultant infrared radiation around the Mars 2020 vehicle. This involves comparing predictions for flow-field properties and radiative transfer obtained using the conventional two-temperature model, the multigroup non-Boltzmann model, and for decoupled/coupled flow-radiation calculations. Conventional two-temperature models overestimate the rate of thermal equilibration in the near-wake region resulting in the population of midlying and upper CO2 vibrational levels being underpredicted by multiple orders of magnitude. Additionally, the two-temperature approach (in comparison to bin-based StS) overpredicts the rate of CO2 dissociation thereby leading to erroneous estimates for flow properties in the postshock region (primary source of afterbody radiative emission). This results in inflated values for surface radiative heat flux with two-temperature modeling, although overall differences in radiative behavior are tempered by the fast characteristic relaxation times for ground vibrational levels.},

 abstract = {The radiative heat flux imparted on the after-body of vehicles entering the Martian atmosphere is simulated. The radiation is dominated by CO2 bands emitting in the midwave infrared. This mechanism traditionally has not been considered in the design of past Mars entry vehicles. However, with recent analysis showing that CO2 radiative heating can exceed convective heating on after-body surfaces, and with several upcoming and proposed missions to Mars potentially affected, an investigation of this radiation is warranted. This paper aims to quantify and improve understanding of the impact of radiation to aerothermal heating predictions for Mars entry. The tangent-slab approximation is shown to be overly conservative, by as much as 58%, for most of the backshell compared with using a full angular integration method. However, due to the complexity of the wake flow, it is also shown that tangent slab does not always represent an upper limit for radiative heating. Furthermore, analysis shows that it is not possible to provide a general correction factor to convert tangent-slab results to those obtained using the more rigorous full integration method. Radiative heating on the after-body often exceeds convective heating and therefore must be included in thermal protection system design for future missions.},

@article{pub.1122553238,
 abstract = {Radiative transfer calculations in complex three-dimensional domains are plagued by computational bottlenecks due to the combined cost of resolving spectral, angular, and spatial dependence. The current work presents a systematic study into the efficacy of three commonly used reduced-order wide-band models, Planck-averaging, and statistics-based k-distribution and theory of homogenization, for modeling non-equilibrium radiation. A reinterpretation of Planck-averaging based on the maximum entropy principle combined with the commonly used multi-band opacity binning allows a direct equivalence to be drawn with the two statistics-based approaches. Additionally, the three seemingly distinct methods are shown to be strictly derived only for local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions which limits their accuracy when simulating non-equilibrium radiation. This shortcoming is addressed through the development of a novel grouping strategy for defining larger groups of individual frequencies from detailed radiation databases (based on line-by-line or narrow-band models) while accounting for variation in all radiative properties under non-equilibrium. Radiative transfer calculations for different Earth and Jupiter entry problems are performed using the different spectral models. Conventional reduced-order wide-band approaches converge slowly to the solution obtained using detailed spectral models. However, the new non-equilibrium grouping strategy allows both total quantities-of-interest and their detailed spectral variation to be predicted accurately while employing fewer reduced-order groups. The current model-reduction methodology provides nearly two orders-of-magnitude decrease in required spectral evaluations along a given line-of-sight with respect to narrow-band methods (and three to four orders with respect to original LBL databases) and is ideal for coupled flow-radiation calculations.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a trajectory-based heating and ablation study of the Galileo probe forebody flow and thermal protection system performance. The validity of modeling assumptions regarding diffusion, radiative heating, and ablation made in previous work, including preflight predictions, are addressed. The Navier–Stokes equations are solved assuming a one-temperature chemical nonequilibrium flowfield with coupled radiation and ablation. Geometric changes in the forebody due to ablation are accounted for. Solving the Stefan–Maxwell equations to compute the species mass diffusion in the flowfield, instead of assuming a constant Schmidt number as was done in previous studies, was found to significantly increase total predicted recession by about 10% on the flank, due to increased convective heating. Application of the high-fidelity ray-tracing approach resulted in a 10% reduction in the radiative heating along the forebody when compared with the heritage tangent-slab approximation. Additional modeling approaches, such as state-specific H modeling, application of ray-tracing for coupled flowfield radiative source terms, and including precursor absorption were considered but found to have a minimal impact on recession. The resulting nominal prediction was found to be nearly within the uncertainty of the flight data along the entire surface of the probe. This improved agreement relative to past studies is due to the notable impact of shape change, multicomponent diffusion, and ray-tracing radiative heating, most of which were not included in previous models. To provide uncertainty bounds for the present simulations, an uncertainty analysis was performed. Sources of uncertainty were identified in the ablation modeling, radiation modeling, flowfield kinetics, turbulence modeling, and thermodynamic properties of select species. When the impact of all considered uncertainties are combined, the stagnation point recession varies between −13% and +17% of the nominal value while a near constant ±0.35 cm uncertainty band exists on the flank.},

 abstract = {This paper develops a computational fluid dynamics capability for simulating the radiative emission from a meteor shock-layer and wake to an external observer. The developed capability includes the impact of radiation and ablation on the meteor flowfield, where coupled radiation accounts for the impact of radiation on the flowfield energy equations and coupled ablation accounts for the injection of ablation species from the meteoroid surface into the flow. This capability includes updated flowfield chemistry and nonequilibrium radiation models, which are compiled from the literature. To provide a level of validation for this capability, the Benešov spectral measurements are considered. Although the meteoroid was likely fragmented at the 47 and 57 km altitudes considered, and the measurement uncertainty is roughly ± 50%, these measurements represent the best available spectral measurements for a relatively large (meter-class) bolide. To determine the equivalent meteoroid diameter for the Benešov simulations, the continuum component of the spectrum in the 570 to 610 nm range is considered. This wavelength range is dominated by air emission from the high pressure and temperature shock-layer in front of the meteoroid, which is simulated with a relatively small uncertainty (compared to the wake emission) and is sensitive to the equivalent meteoroid diameter. Because of these characteristics, the simulated meteoroid diameter is adjusted until the continuum component in this wavelength range matches the measurements. This results in equivalent diameters ranging from 0.62 to 0.9 m. The range of equivalent diameters is due to the various meteoroid geometries considered, where increasing the bluntness decreases the required diameter. Applying these diameters to simulations at 47 and 57 km results in simulated spectra that compare within 30% of the measured values, considering the wavelength integrated values between 400 and 650 nm. This agreement is well within the estimated measurement uncertainty of ± 50%. All major spectral features are captured by the simulations. A comparison with the measured wake-only spectrum suggests that emission from wake locations over 150 m from the meteoroid are the primary source of the small disagreement seen between the measurements and simulations. Overall, the relatively good agreement between the simulations and measurements provides a level of validation for the developed model that has not been previously available.},

To enable these analyses, a new approach for solving this problem with a sparse set of particles is presented and demonstrated on a problem from literature involving the ExoMars Schiaparelli entry vehicle. This new approach, referred to here as the Trajectory Control Volume (TCV) method is verified against traditional approaches based on Monte Carlo, and is shown to require over 3 orders-of-magnitude less samples to obtain the same results. An example UQ and global nonlinear sensitivity analysis is performed with the new TCV approach. This analysis, which is not feasible with previous approaches, demonstrate the computational efficiency of the approach for UQ problems, as well as provides some insight into the driving factors behind dust erosion. UQ and sensitivity results indicate that accurate characterization of material composition and size distribution for dust environments is key to reducing uncertainty in predicted surface recession due to dust impingement.},

 abstract = {The European Space Agency flew an entry, descent, and landing demonstrator module called Schiaparelli that entered the atmosphere of Mars on 19 October 2016. The entry and descent instrumentation suite had sensors on both the heat shield and backshell and included forebody pressure transducers and thermocouples (Atmospheric Mars Entry and Landing Investigations and Analysis, or AMELIA), along with aftbody pressure transducers and heat flux (COMbined Aerothermal and Radiometer Sensors instrument package, or COMARS) and narrowband radiative heatflux sensors (Infrared CO Two Measurement, or ICOTOM). Because of the failed landing attempt, only a subset of the flight data was transmitted before and after plasma blackout. The goal of this paper is to present comparisons of the flight data with calculations using NASA’s aerodynamic and aeroheating simulation tools. Simulations were conducted at various angles of attack to compare against forebody pressure data and to infer the angle of attack used in full three-dimensional simulations to calculate the total heat flux at the sensor locations. Comparisons with the COMARS total heat flux data and backshell pressure data are presented. Furthermore, due to the sparse dataset, results are also compared with the reconstructed heat flux, which was calculated from an inverse analysis of the AMELIA thermocouple data. The simulations agree within 16% for both the total heat flux measured in flight and the heat flux reconstructed from the thermocouple data. A potential link between the Schiaparelli high spin rate observed during entry as documented in the anomaly report and the unexpected stagnation point pressure measurement is also discussed.},

 abstract = {View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-2396.vid This paper introduces a method for assessing similarity between available shock-layer ra- diation measurements and the radiative heating to a vehicle of interest. This method will be referred to as flowfield property binning (FPB). The challenge in developing this approach is that radiometer measurements from a surface normal line of sight, observed radiation mea- surements of the entire shock-layer from a distance, or measured shock-tube nonequilibrium profiles are notably different geometrically than the radiative flux to a vehicle surface. There- fore, the relative contributions of various regions of the shock-layer to the measurement, and how these relative contributions compare with the radiative heating to a vehicle of interest, are unclear. By tracking the radiation contribution from each flowfield location, and then grouping this contribution based on two local flowfield properties, these geometric differences are removed. This provides a two dimensional group, or bin, distribution that represents the radiation environment in the same format for various types of radiation simulations, such as observed radiation or radiative flux to a vehicle surface. In the limits of optically-thin radiation transport and thermochemical equilibrium flow, the choice of pressure and temperature as the binning flowfield properties is shown to provide a bin distribution that uniquely defines the radiation simulation. This concept is found to be sufficient for establishing similarity be- tween two cases even when the optically-thin and thermochemical equilibrium assumptions are not satisfied. A simple metric of comparison between bin distributions from different cases is provided by the histogram intersection algorithm. This algorithm results in a histogram intersection factor (H) between 0 and 1, which represents the fraction of the radiation that is similar between the two cases. Therefore, if H evaluated between bin distributions for two com- pletely different radiation problems is near 1, then they represent essentially the same radiation problem. This means that they depend on the same weighting of various radiation modeling parameters evaluated at the same pressure and temperature. If one of these cases agrees well with a radiation measurement, then the matching bin distributions provide justification for applying this experimental validation to the other case. Even for H values as low as 0.2, the measurement case could be considered relevant if there are no other useful measurements. This approach allows observed radiation measurements to directly inform radiative heating simulations, which allows NASA’s past and future investments in observed radiation measure- ments to directly inform the radiative heating uncertainty or margins for future vehicle design. This FPB approach is also used to determine shock-tube conditions for informing backshell radiative heating simulations, where the normal shock velocity and Lagrangian time from the shock are used for the binning variables instead of pressure and temperature.},

 abstract = {View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-3799.vid Recent Hayabusa 2 spectral measurements are compared with state-of-the-art shock-layer radiation simulations resulting from the LAURA/HARA code suite. These simulations include coupled ablation, which accounts for the injection of ablation products into the flowfield, and coupled radiation, which accounts for radiative energy loss in the flowfield. The comparison between the simulations and measurements focuses on three atomic nitrogen lines, two atomic oxygen lines, one atomic hydrogen line, and the CN Violet band system. Parametric uncertain- ties are evaluated for these features using a recently developed capability in LAURA/HARA. The resulting parametric uncertainties range from 50 to over 100% for the atomic lines, and 80% for CN Violet. Uncertainties in flowfield kinetics and non-Boltzmann modeling provide the dominant contribution to these uncertainties. For the atomic nitrogen and oxygen lines, comparisons between the nominal simulations and measurements show agreement well within these simulation uncertainty bounds, with the measurements within 20% of the nominal simu- lation over most of the trajectory, and within 10% at peak emission. For the ablation product emission from the 656 nm atomic hydrogen line, the agreement between measurements and simulations is within ±20% for all trajectory points except one outlier. For the ablation product emission from CN Violet, the simulations overpredict the measurements by over a factor of two early in the trajectory, with the comparison improving later in the trajectory. This disagree- ment for CN Violet is consistent with the ≈±80% parametric uncertainty bounds evaluated for the simulations. To utilize the agreement between the atomic line simulations and measure- ments in the assessment of the radiative heating margin for a future flight vehicle, the flowfield property binning (FPB) approach is applied. Using the Mars Sample Return (MSR) Earth Entry System (EES) as an example, the combination of the favorable Hayabusa comparisons and the FPB analysis justify a potential reduction in the radiative heating margin for the exam- ple considered. This direct quantitative link between observed radiation measurements and the radiative heating margin of future flight vehicles demonstrates the value of these observed radiation measurements.},

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched the Hayabusa2 probe in 2014 to collect samples from a near-earth asteroid and return them to Earth. The Hayabusa2 sample return capsule (SRC) reentered the Earth’s atmosphere over Australia on 05 December 2020 (UTC). The NASA Scientifically Calibrated In-Flight Imagery (SCIFLI) team equipped two aircraft with a total of ten imaging spectrometers. Datasets were successfully collected on all ten imaging spectrometers and, when combined, covered the ultraviolet (UV) to shortwave infrared (SWIR) (300 to 1700nm) spectral range. The spectral signatures include thermal emission from the SRC and shock layer/wake emission from the ionized flowfield. This paper provides a summary of the instrumentation used and the comprehensive calibration process which included pre-mission characterizations, in-flight star calibrations and post-mission calibrations. The measured signatures include traceable uncertainty bounds and the uncertainty analysis is presented. The calibrated data are shown, and interesting spectral features are discussed. Finally, the measured data are compared with the NASA model predictions.},

The Trajectory Control Volume (TCV) method, which uses a sparse set of probe particles to predict surface erosion distributions on general vehicles, is reformulated for the solution of source terms by subdividing TCVs along their mean trajectory and computing a flux difference through the sub volumes. The approach is verified successfully against a boundary layer solution and shown to agree well with experimental measurements. A representative Mars entry case, with conditions and geometry based on the ExoMars Schiaparelli capsule, is solved with the approach to study the impact of two-way coupling on surface heating and erosion. Results indicate that for realistic loading conditions, heating is largely unmodified compared to one-way coupled results at peak heating trajectory conditions, and no measureable difference is observed in the surface erosion rate. At increased loading conditions, collisional heating produces a significant overall heating increase.},

 abstract = {The standard approach for simulating hypersonic dust erosion problems using mixed Eulerian–Lagrangian two-phase solvers may be too computationally expensive for routine simulations, and particularly for uncertainty quantification (UQ) analyses. For efficient analyses, a new approach for predicting the surface dust erosion in hypersonic flows with a sparse set of particles is presented and demonstrated on a problem from literature involving the ExoMars Schiaparelli entry vehicle. This new approach, referred to here as the Trajectory Control Volume (TCV) method, is verified against traditional approaches based on Monte Carlo and is shown to require over three orders of magnitude fewer samples to obtain the same results. An example UQ and global nonlinear sensitivity analysis is performed with the new TCV approach. This analysis, which is not feasible with previous approaches, demonstrates the computational efficiency of the approach for UQ problems as well as provides some insight into the driving factors behind dust erosion. UQ and sensitivity results indicate that accurate characterization of material composition and size distribution for dust environments is key to reducing uncertainty in predicted surface recession due to dust impingement.},

 abstract = {The first study of the full coupling between the aerothermodynamics, the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), and the plasma sheaths within Earth-entry flows is here performed. The problem addressed herein is representative of a force-generating MHD patch located between the stagnation point and the aft of a capsule entering the Earth’s atmosphere at Mach 34. The reactions are obtained from the Park chemical solver and the transport coefficients from the Gupta–Yos model with modifications. The physical model fully couples the drift–diffusion model for the sheaths to the multispecies Navier–Stokes equations for the plasma flow. The Hall and ion slip effects are taken into consideration within the plasma flow and within the sheaths. The effect of the electrode material on the MHD process is studied. Using thoriated tungsten instead of graphite leads to a thirtyfold increase in the Lorentz forces and also leads to significantly reduced heat fluxes on the cathode. This is attributed to the much higher electrical conductivity of the thoriated tungsten sheath reducing by orders of magnitude the plasma electrical resistance near the surfaces.},

@article{pub.1164211367,
 abstract = {A relationship is developed for evaluating the initial meteoroid diameter based on the measured absolute visual magnitude prior to fragmentation. This approach provides an alternative to the luminous efficiency approach for evaluating the size of a meteoroid from a measured lightcurve. The developed relationship, which is valid for asteroidal meteoroids with entry velocities below 30 km/s and initial diameters greater than 10 cm, is written as D = 0 . 0556 × 1 0 − 0 . 182 M 60 k m − 0 . 0562 V 60 k m , where D is the initial meteoroid diameter in m, M 60 k m is the absolute visual magnitude measured at an altitude of 60 km, and V 60 k m is the velocity in km/s at 60 km altitude. This relationship is enabled by the insights provided by recent computational fluid dynamics and radiation simulations, which show that for an unfragmented meteoroid, the M 60 k m value is a much stronger function of meteoroid diameter than the meteor ablation rate or meteoroid composition. This relationship is also enabled by the recent increase in the number of meteor events with calibrated lightcurves and recovered meteorites. In addition to providing the meteorite density, which enables a more accurate conversion between meteoroid mass and size, the recovered meteorites enable a diameter based on radionuclide or noble gas analyses. This provides an alternative to the dynamic mass and infrasound-based diameters, which results in three different meteor diameter assessments that are independent of the luminous efficiency. These three approaches are used to develop the present relationship between the meteor diameter and M 60 k m . The altitude of 60 km is chosen for developing this relationship because it is high enough to minimize the potential for fragmentation and low enough for ablation to have reached a steady-state. This altitude is also low enough to avoid significant measurement noise in the lightcurve, which may be present at higher altitudes due to weaker emission and a longer measurement distance.},

 abstract = {NASA's Probabilistic Asteroid Impact Risk (PAIR) model assesses the likelihood of potential damage for asteroid impact scenarios. Fast-running models are used to capture the effects of different hazards. This paper looks specifically at local ground damage hazards, including blast overpressure and thermal radiation damage, for large object impact scenarios. A sensitivity study is conducted to determine which parameters, and over what ranges, cause impact risks to become sensitive to thermal damage. Two additional thermal models with different approaches are used for comparison. The study determined the current thermal model is most sensitive to the luminous efficiency parameter that reflects the model's uncertainty in the amount of energy contributing to the thermal radiation damage. This sensitivity was most apparent for the highest severity damage levels. Comparisons of the three models showed that, in addition to sensitivities within the models, the impact risks are also sensitive to the choice of thermal model. The study results were applied to the 2023 Planetary Defense Conference hypothetical asteroid impact scenario (800 m diameter, 10.29 Gt energy), and parameter ranges of interest were determined. At the serious damage level, luminous efficiencies above 0.006 (0.6%) showed a small chance of thermal playing an important role, while luminous efficiencies above 0.0008 (0.08%) led to thermal playing a significant role at the unsurvivable damage severity level. Study results are used to identify key areas where additional model refinement and better knowledge of asteroid properties may be important for improving damage estimates.},
