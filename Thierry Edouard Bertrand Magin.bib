 abstract = {A new numerical method is presented here that allows to consider chemically reacting gases during the direct numerical simulation of a hypersonic fluid flow. The method comprises the direct coupling of a solver for the fluid mechanical model and a library providing the physio-chemical model. The numerical method for the fluid mechanical model integrates the compressible Navier–Stokes equations using an explicit time advancement scheme and high-order finite differences. This Navier–Stokes code can be applied to the investigation of laminar-turbulent transition and boundary-layer instability. The numerical method for the physio-chemical model provides thermodynamic and transport properties for different gases as well as chemical production rates, while here we exclusively consider a five species air mixture. The new method is verified for a number of test cases at Mach 10, including the one-dimensional high-temperature flow downstream of a normal shock, a hypersonic chemical reacting boundary layer in local thermodynamic equilibrium and a hypersonic reacting boundary layer with finite-rate chemistry. We are able to confirm that the diffusion flux plays an important role for a high-temperature boundary layer in local thermodynamic equilibrium. Moreover, we demonstrate that the flow for a case previously considered as a benchmark for the investigation of non-equilibrium chemistry can be regarded as frozen. Finally, the new method is applied to investigate the effect of finite-rate chemistry on boundary layer instability by considering the downstream evolution of a small-amplitude wave and comparing results with those obtained for a frozen gas as well as a gas in local thermodynamic equilibrium.},

 abstract = {The interaction between a chemically reactive boundary layer and an ablative material is one of the most challenging phenomena to model when predicting the heat load during atmospheric entries of spacecraft. The gas-material interactions are usually assumed to occur at the surface while the ablation of new low density materials in strong diffusion regime is rather a volume phenomenon that should be captured to accurately predict the recession rate. This paper presents a continuum approach developed to go progressively from a plain fluid region to a porous medium in order to capture interactions between ablation and the boundary layer. The tool is developed using high order Discontinuous Galerkin discretization. The unified tool is verified against several test cases of increasing physical complexity. The replication of an experiment conducted in the NASA Ames flow tube facility which concerns the ablation of carbon fibers by a low Reynolds flow is subsequently presented. Comparison with experimental results shows the limits of current models to capture the competition between surface and volume ablation. We propose a new model to account for micro scale phenomena during the oxidation of the carbon fibers. The proposed model leads to a good agreement with experimental data and shows the importance of having more micro-scale information on the erosion of the fibers.},

 abstract = {Atmospheric entry flights, combusting flows, experiments in high-enthalpy tunnels are examples of aerospace problems in which an accurate computation of the transport properties of gas mixtures are of crucial importance. Transport coefficients for collision-dominated dilute perfect gas mixtures can be obtained from the rigorous kinetic theory analysis of Chapman and Enskog. The full expressions needed for the computation are included, and all the practical details for an efficient implementation are discussed. The present method constitutes the current state-of-the-art and should be preferred to the use of mixture rules, which are slower and less accurate. The final accuracy depends on obtaining accurate sets of collision integrals for the specific mixture used in the actual computation (several such sets are available in the literature). In addition to the general expressions suited to thermal and chemical nonequilibrium conditions, the particular case of thermochemical equilibrium is also discussed, and the recent findings regarding taking into account mixing and demixing effects are included in the description. Finally, numerical values of the transport coefficients of air under equilibrium conditions at one atmosphere are presented in the range of 500–15000K.},

 abstract = {Ablative materials are used in thermal protection systems for atmospheric re-entry vehicle heat shields. A detailed chemical equilibrium heat and mass transport model for porous ablators is presented for the first time. The governing equations are volume-averaged forms of the conservation equations for gas density, gas elements, solid mass, gas momentum, and total energy. The element (gas) fluxes are coupled at the surface of the material with an inlet/outlet boundary condition, allowing modeling either atmospheric gases entering the porous material by forced convection or pyrolysis gases exiting the material. The model is implemented in the Porous material Analysis Toolbox based on OpenFOAM (PATO). The thermodynamics and chemistry library Mutation++ is used as a third party library to compute equilibrium compositions, gas properties, and solve the state-of-the-art boundary layer approximation to provide the ablation rate and the element mass fractions at the surface of the material. The model is applied to the detailed analysis of boundary layer and pyrolysis gas flows within a porous carbon/phenolic ablator characterized in a state-of-the-art arc-jet test. The selected configuration consists of an iso-flux ellipsoid-cylinder sample submitted to a 2.5MW/m2 heat flux with a decreasing pressure gradient from the stagnation point to the cylinder’s side. During the first tenths of a second of the test, boundary layer gases percolate through the sample. Then, as the sample heats up, the internal pressure increases inside the sample due to pyrolysis–gas production. The resulting pressure gradient blocks the boundary layer gases and leads to a pyrolysis gas flow that separates into two streams: one going towards the upper surface, and one going towards the lower pressure side under the shoulder of the sample. We show that the temperature profile is modified when using the detailed mass transport model. The sample’s sub-shoulder zone is significantly cooled down while a temperature increase is observed in-depth. Implementing the model of this study in space agency codes will allow improving ground-test analyses and help provide more accurate material properties for design.},

 abstract = {The high temperatures associated with the hypersonic reentry process lead to an increase in the collisions between molecules, which may result in the disruption of the electronic structure, producing free electrons and ions. This production of free electrons and ions creates a plasma or ionized flowfield around the vehicle that is known to degrade the quality of radio-wave signal propagation, leading to a loss of communication or “blackout.” This study involves performing hypersonic computational fluid dynamics simulations in the commercial software CFD++ with a blunt-nosed cone geometry at different flight conditions to predict how and when ground communication can be achieved to aid in the design of an alert transmitter, which is an extension of aircraft collision-avoidance system technology. Computational results show that a small blunt-nosed cone geometry has decreased ionization regions as the cone angle decreases due to a shifting of the reaction zone further downstream. As a result, higher freestream velocities have less of an impact in determining the location for an antenna, and communicating along the stagnation line is seen to be independent of cone angle.},

It now remains to validate these encouraging preliminary results against other numerical simulations and experiments.},

 abstract = {A new formalism for the transport properties of partially ionized and unmagnetized plasmas is investigated from a computational point of view. Heavy particle transport expressions for shear viscosity, translational thermal conductivity, and thermal diffusion ratios are obtained from the solution of symmetric linear systems. Electron transport properties are also presented. A general Stefan–Maxwell equation and two approximate formulations deal with diffusion phenomenon. Well-posedness of the transport properties is established, provided that some conditions on the kinetic data are met. The mathematical structure of the transport matrices is readily used to build transport algorithms inspired by Ern and Giovangigli [J. Comput. Phys. 120 (1995) 105]. These algorithms rely either on a direct linear solver or on convergent iterative Krylov projection methods, such as the conjugate gradient. The Stefan–Maxwell matrix is singular and a mass conservation constraint completes the system of equations. A yet symmetric and non-singular Stefan–Maxwell matrix including the mass constraint is introduced for the direct method. A suitable projector associated with the singular form of the matrix is used for the iterative methods. An 11-species air mixture in local thermodynamic equilibrium at atmospheric pressure serves as benchmark to assess the physical model and numerical methods. Superiority of the conjugate gradient method with respect to the direct solver and approximate mixture rules found in the literature is demonstrated in terms of accuracy and computational cost.},

 abstract = {The goal of this paper is to generalize the well-balanced approach for non-equilibrium flow studied by Wang et al. (2009) [29] to a class of low dissipative high-order shock-capturing filter schemes and to explore more advantages of well-balanced schemes in reacting flows. More general 1D and 2D reacting flow models and new examples of shock turbulence interactions are provided to demonstrate the advantage of well-balanced schemes. The class of filter schemes developed by Yee et al. (1999) [33], Sjögreen and Yee (2004) [27] and Yee and Sjögreen (2007) [38] consist of two steps, a full time step of spatially high-order non-dissipative base scheme and an adaptive non-linear filter containing shock-capturing dissipation. A good property of the filter scheme is that the base scheme and the filter are stand-alone modules in designing. Therefore, the idea of designing a well-balanced filter scheme is straightforward, i.e. choosing a well-balanced base scheme with a well-balanced filter (both with high-order accuracy). A typical class of these schemes shown in this paper is the high-order central difference schemes/predictor–corrector (PC) schemes with a high-order well-balanced WENO filter. The new filter scheme with the well-balanced property will gather the features of both filter methods and well-balanced properties: it can preserve certain steady-state solutions exactly; it is able to capture small perturbations, e.g. turbulence fluctuations; and it adaptively controls numerical dissipation. Thus it shows high accuracy, efficiency and stability in shock/turbulence interactions. Numerical examples containing 1D and 2D smooth problems, 1D stationary contact discontinuity problem and 1D turbulence/shock interactions are included to verify the improved accuracy, in addition to the well-balanced behavior.},

This property is determined by combining experimental measurements and simulations of the reactive boundary layer near the material surface. The inductively-driven Plasmatron facility at the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics provides a test environment to analyze gas-surface interactions under effective hypersonic conditions. In this study, we develop an uncertainty quantification methodology to rebuild values of the gas enthalpy and material catalytic property from Plasmatron experiments. A non-intrusive spectral projection method is coupled with an in-house boundary-layer solver, to propagate uncertainties and provide error bars on the rebuilt gas enthalpy and material catalytic property, as well as to determine which uncertainties have the largest contribution to the outputs of the experiments. We show that the uncertainties computed with the methodology developed are significantly reduced compared to those determined using a more conservative engineering approach adopted in the analysis of previous experimental campaigns.},

 abstract = {A rovibrational collisional coarse-grain model has been developed to reduce a detailed mechanism for the internal energy excitation and dissociation processes behind a strong shockwave in a nitrogen flow. The rovibrational energy levels of the electronic ground state of the nitrogen molecule were lumped into a smaller number of bins. The reaction rate coefficients of an ab initio database developed at NASA Ames Research Center were averaged for each bin based on a uniform distribution of the energy levels within the bin. The results were obtained by coupling the Master equation for the reduced mechanism with a one-dimensional flow solver for conditions expected for reentry into Earth’s atmosphere at 10km/s. The coarse-grain collisional model developed allow us to describe accurately the internal energy relaxation and dissociation processes based on a smaller number of equations, as opposed to existing reduced models assuming thermal equilibrium between the rotational and translational energy modes.},

 abstract = {The stable computation of linearly constrained, multiphase, chemical equilibrium compositions is an important topic for a wide range of industrial and academic applications. Numerous computational methods have been developed to solve such problems which are, in general, susceptible to failure under certain conditions due to numerical stiffness. In this work, we present a Gibbs function continuation method for linearly constrained multiphase equilibrium calculations. The method converts the nonlinear Element Potential Equations - derived from the minimization of the mixture Gibbs free energy using the Lagrange multiplier technique - into an initial value problem which can be stably integrated through the use of a property of linear least squares solutions. The stability and convergence properties of the proposed method are derived and it is shown that the single phase method arises as a special case of the multiphase algorithm when only one phase is considered. Two test cases are presented to clarify and demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the method.},

 abstract = {IntroductionDuring the hypersonic entry of a space vehicle into a planetary or lunar atmosphere, the flow field becomes partially ionized. The percentage of ionization depends on the entry speed and the vehicle size. The electrons and atomic/molecular ions produced by the ionization introduce new reaction mechanisms that significantly influence the radiative and convective heat loads. Thus a simulation of the flow field behind the shock wave needs to incorporate the production of ionic species, chemical reactions due to charge-neutral and charge-charge interactions, and the removal of the charged species by recombination.},

 abstract = {The stagnation-line flow over re-entry bodies is analyzed by means of a quantum based collisional model which accounts for dissociation and energy transfer in N2-N interactions. The physical model is based on a kinetic database developed at NASA Ames Research Center. The reduction of the kinetic mechanism is achieved by lumping the rovibrational energy levels of the N2 molecule in energy bins. The energy bins are treated as separate species, thus allowing for non-Boltzmann distributions of their populations. The governing equations are discretized in space by means of the Finite Volume method. A fully implicit time-integration is used to obtain steady-state solutions. The results show that the population of the energy bins strongly deviate from a Boltzmann distribution close to the shock wave and across the boundary layer. The sensitivity analysis to the number of energy bins reveals that accurate estimation of flow quantities (such as chemical composition and wall heat flux) can be obtained by using only 10 energy bins. A comparison with the predictions obtained by means of conventional multi-temperature models indicates that the former can lead to an overestimation of the wall heat flux, due to an inaccurate modeling of recombination in the boundary layer.},

 abstract = {Coordinated ground‐based observations of Titan were performed around or during the Huygens atmospheric probe mission at Titan on 14 January 2005, connecting the momentary in situ observations by the probe with the synoptic coverage provided by continuing ground‐based programs. These observations consisted of three different categories: (1) radio telescope tracking of the Huygens signal at 2040 MHz, (2) observations of the atmosphere and surface of Titan, and (3) attempts to observe radiation emitted during the Huygens Probe entry into Titan's atmosphere. The Probe radio signal was successfully acquired by a network of terrestrial telescopes, recovering a vertical profile of wind speed in Titan's atmosphere from 140 km altitude down to the surface. Ground‐based observations brought new information on atmosphere and surface properties of the largest Saturnian moon. No positive detection of phenomena associated with the Probe entry was reported. This paper reviews all these measurements and highlights the achieved results. The ground‐based observations, both radio and optical, are of fundamental importance for the interpretation of results from the Huygens mission.},

 abstract = {Radiation during Titan entry is important at lower speeds (around 5–6  km/s) compared to other planetary entries due to the superequilibrium formation of the highly radiating species, cyanogen, in the shock layer (with concentrations being up to 50% higher than equilibrium). A collisional-radiative model has been developed to predict the nonequilibrium populations of cyanogen and nitrogen and the subsequent radiation emitted during entry into the Titan atmosphere. A vibration state specific model based on Schwartz–Slawsky–Herzfield theory, which includes excitation and deexcitation reactions for 47 vibration states of the ground electronic state of nitrogen, was incorporated into a previously developed collisional-radiative code. The model has been tested against measurements obtained with the Electric Arc Shock Tube at the NASA Ames Research Center and the X2 shock tube at the University of Queensland. The vibrationally specific nitrogen collisional-radiative simulations show better agreement with experimental data in terms of the initial rise of the radiation, however, generally do not offer improved agreement in terms of the absolute intensity level. The results from this paper indicate that the collisional-radiative models overestimate the level of radiation by approximately a factor of 1.5–10, depending on the condition. Furthermore, results presented in this paper show that, by adjusting the excitation rate of cyanogen and dissociation of rate of nitrogen, good agreement between experiment and simulation can be obtained.},

Radiative heating was computed with the radiation code SPECAIR, assuming a Boltzmann distribution of the excited electronic levels at a characteristic temperature taken as the vibrational temperature of the gas. CN violet is found to be the most intense emitter, followed by CN red, C2 Swan, and at early trajectory points by the first and second positive systems of N2. Solutions of the 1‐D radiative transport equation along stagnation streamlines show that self‐absorption by the plasma layer reduces the total emission by up to about 20%. The fine structure of the CN violet spectra (spin‐splitting) was taken into account to accurately determine self‐absorption by CN violet. The potential importance of argon radiation was estimated and shown to be negligible. The resulting fluxes were found to be sustainable by the Huygens's Thermal Protection System. The feasibility of the mission was deemed possible under the updated entry parameters and atmospheric composition.},

 abstract = {In this paper a spectral-Lagrangian method is proposed for the full, non-linear Boltzmann equation for a multi-energy level gas typical of a hypersonic re-entry flow. Internal energy levels are treated as separate species and inelastic collisions (leading to internal energy excitation and relaxation) are accounted for. The formulation developed can also be used for the case of a gas mixture made of monatomic gases without internal energy (where only elastic collisions occur). The advantage of the spectral-Lagrangian method lies in the generality of the algorithm in use for the evaluation of the elastic and inelastic collision operators, as well as the conservation of mass, momentum and energy during collisions. The latter is realized through the solution of constrained optimization problems. The computational procedure is based on the Fourier transform of the partial elastic and inelastic collision operators and exploits the fact that these can be written as weighted convolutions in Fourier space with no restriction on the cross-section model. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical examples for both space homogeneous and in-homogeneous problems. Computational results are compared with those obtained by means of the DSMC method in order to assess the accuracy of the proposed spectral-Lagrangian method.},

 abstract = {In this study, a Hybrid Statistical Narrow Band (HSNB) model is implemented to make fast and accurate predictions of radiative transfer effects on hypersonic entry flows. The HSNB model combines a Statistical Narrow Band (SNB) model for optically thick molecular systems, a box model for optically thin molecular systems and continua, and a Line-By-Line (LBL) description of atomic radiation. Radiative transfer calculations are coupled to a 1D stagnation-line flow model under thermal and chemical nonequilibrium. Earth entry conditions corresponding to the FIRE 2 experiment, as well as Titan entry conditions corresponding to the Huygens probe, are considered in this work. Thermal nonequilibrium is described by a two temperature model, although non-Boltzmann distributions of electronic levels provided by a Quasi-Steady State model are also considered for radiative transfer. For all the studied configurations, radiative transfer effects on the flow, the plasma chemistry and the total heat flux at the wall are analyzed in detail. The HSNB model is shown to reproduce LBL results with an accuracy better than 5% and a speed up of the computational time around two orders of magnitude. Concerning molecular radiation, the HSNB model provides a significant improvement in accuracy compared to the Smeared-Rotational-Band model, especially for Titan entries dominated by optically thick CN radiation.},

In this paper, we present the results of an elaborate test campaign on a lightweight carbon composite ablator with the aim of defining a procedure for material response characterization in a 1.2-MW inductively heated Plasmatron facility, suitable to reproduce the hypersonic flight boundary layer environment. Three different test gases were used, air, nitrogen, and argon, at surface temperatures exceeding 3300 K. A comprehensive experimental setup was developed including a nonintrusive technique to measure surface recession by means of a high-speed camera. Surface degradation was strongly test gas dependent, while mass loss was mainly driven by in-depth decomposition of phenolic resin. Emission spectroscopy helped us identify C2 as a product of dissociating hydrocarbons, as well as cyanogen, suggesting surface nitridation. Melt flow at the surface and silicon emission indicated degradation of the glass microspheres used as additional filler. In air plasma, oxidation was inferred to be the main mechanism for ablation.},

 abstract = {Ablative Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) allowed the first humans to safely return to Earth from the moon and are still considered as the only solution for future high-speed reentry missions. But despite the advancements made since Apollo, heat flux prediction remains an imperfect science and engineers resort to safety factors to determine the TPS thickness. This goes at the expense of embarked payload, hampering, for example, sample return missions. Ground testing in plasma wind-tunnels is currently the only affordable possibility for both material qualification and validation of material response codes. The subsonic 1.2MW Inductively Coupled Plasmatron facility at the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics is able to reproduce a wide range of reentry environments. This protocol describes a procedure for the study of the gas/surface interaction on ablative materials in high enthalpy flows and presents sample results of a non-pyrolyzing, ablating carbon fiber precursor. With this publication, the authors envisage the definition of a standard procedure, facilitating comparison with other laboratories and contributing to ongoing efforts to improve heat shield reliability and reduce design uncertainties. The described core techniques are non-intrusive methods to track the material recession with a high-speed camera along with the chemistry in the reactive boundary layer, probed by emission spectroscopy. Although optical emission spectroscopy is limited to line-of-sight measurements and is further constrained to electronically excited atoms and molecules, its simplicity and broad applicability still make it the technique of choice for analysis of the reactive boundary layer. Recession of the ablating sample further requires that the distance of the measurement location with respect to the surface is known at all times during the experiment. Calibration of the optical system of the applied three spectrometers allowed quantitative comparison. At the fiber scale, results from a post-test microscopy analysis are presented.},

We investigate their resistance to high heating conditions, and characterize gas-surface interaction phenomena, including the interaction of the pyrolysis gases with the hot plasma flow. The experiments were carried out in the Plasmatron facility of the von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics. The aero-thermodynamic environment of atmospheric entry in the boundary layer of a test object was selected with surface temperatures between 1900K and 2800K, and test chamber pressures of 15hPa, 100hPa, and 200hPa.Those conditions led to recession rates between 39μm/s and 83μm/s in air plasmas. Micrographs revealed oxidation of the char layer and carbon fibers. Carbon deposition in the form of soot was observed on samples tested in nitrogen, contrary to air ablation where charred resin was not found at the surface.We propose an approach to estimate the temporally resolved pyrolysis outgassing rate, based on the emission signature of pyrolysis products and the volume change of the sample. The temporal recession rate was obtained from high-speed camera imaging. This enabled evaluation of the surface recession as a function of the pyrolysis outgassing rate, which was then compared to numerical estimates predicted by thermochemical equilibrium tables.The thermochemical equilibrium model generally underpredicted experimental recession rates, particularly at low pressure (15hPa). Stronger mechanical failure of the material was ruled out as experiments at the same test conditions in nitrogen plasmas did not show any significant recession. Micrographs did not indicate internal oxidation of the material, neither was spallation observed during the low pressure experiments.},

Ablation experiments of a CBCF composite were carried out in an inductively-coupled plasma generator to assess the performance in high-enthalpy flows. Surface temperatures up to 2900K led to strong surface ablation and test samples of hemispherical shape responded with constant surface temperatures and recession rates. Cylindrical samples experienced a continuous surface temperature increase. Emission spectra of the cyano radical CN were indicative of a 4–5mm reactive boundary layer. Deviation from thermal equilibrium was found by comparison to simulated spectra. Micrographs revealed an oxidation zone in the order of 0.2mm at the surface, suggesting a gas phase diffusion controlled ablation regime.

Starting from an electronic specific Collisional-Radiative model, a reduction of the variable set (i.e., mass fractions and temperatures) is proposed by projecting the full set on a reduced basis made up of its principal components. Thus, the flow governing equations are only solved for the principal components. The proposed approach originates from the combustion community, where Manifold Generated Principal Component Analysis (MG-PCA) has been developed as a successful reduction technique. Applications consider ionizing shock waves in argon. The results obtained show that the use of the MG-PCA technique enables for a substantial reduction of the computational time.},

The model is loosely coupled with flow solvers using a Lagrangian method. First, the model was tested against measurements obtained with the shock‐tube of NASA Ames Research Center. Then, the model was applied to the simulation of Huygen's entry. Our simulations predict that the population of the CN(B) state is lower than the Boltzmann population by a factor 40 at trajectory time t = 165 s and by a factor 2 at t = 187 s and that the population of the CN(A) state remains close to the Boltzmann population for both trajectory points. The radiative heat fluxes, driven by the CN(A, B) states, are lower than predictions based on the Boltzmann populations by a factor 15 at t = 165 s and a factor 2 at t = 187 s.},

This work presents a detailed but pragmatic heat and mass transfer model for porous materials containing several solid phases and a single gas phase.

Homogenized models are obtained for solid pyrolysis, pyrolysis species injection in the gas phase, heterogeneous reactions between the solid phases and the gas phase, and homogeneous reactions in the gas phase. The chemistry models are integrated in a macroscopic model making use of volume-averaged governing equations for the conservation of solid mass, gas mass, species (finite-rate chemistry) or elements (equilibrium chemistry), momentum, and energy. The model has been implemented in the Porous Material Analysis Toolbox based on OpenFoam (PATO), distributed Open Source by NASA. Applications to two high-temperature engineering problems are presented. The first application concerns the design of heat-shields of space vehicles. The second one aims at improving the understanding of biomass pyrolysis for the production of biohydrocarbons.},

                  The paper describes a numerical investigation of linear and nonlinear instability in high-speed boundary layers. Both a frozen gas and a finite-rate chemically reacting gas are considered. The weakly nonlinear instability in the presence of a large-amplitude two-dimensional wave is investigated for the case of fundamental resonance. Depending on the amplitude of this two-dimensional primary wave, strong growth of oblique secondary perturbations occurs for favourable relative phase differences between the two. For essentially the same primary amplitude, secondary amplification is almost identical for a reacting and a frozen gas. Therefore, chemical reactions do not directly affect the growth of secondary perturbations, but only indirectly through the change of linear instability and hence amplitude of the primary wave. When the secondary disturbances reach a sufficiently large amplitude, strongly nonlinear effects stabilize both primary and secondary perturbations.},

 abstract = {Prediction of laminar-turbulent transition is a key factor in the design of the heat shield of vehicles (re-)entering a planetary atmosphere. To investigate the transition by means of numerical simulation, accurate and efficient computational methods are necessary. Here, the compressible Navier–Stokes equations are solved for a gas where properties such as specific heat, thermal conductivity, viscosity, and specific gas constant depend on one or two thermodynamic variables. Our approach models a mixture of perfect gases in local thermodynamic equilibrium. The gas properties are provided either by means of direct calls to a library based on statistical mechanics and kinetic theory or indirectly in the form of look-up tables. In the first part of the paper, our method of handling a high-temperature gas in thermochemical equilibrium is described and verified. In the second part, the method is applied to the investigation of linear and non-linear boundary-layer instability. We carry out numerical simulations for a laminar flat-plate boundary layer at Mach 10 with a small, convectively amplified perturbation for both Earth and Martian atmospheres. Amplification of the perturbations shows favorable agreement with results obtained from linear theory. The secondary instability of the boundary layer in the presence of a large-amplitude two-dimensional wave is investigated. We observe that the non-linear mechanism of fundamental resonance becomes active and leads to a strong increase in amplification of three-dimensional disturbance waves.},

 abstract = {A rovibrational collisional model is developed to study energy transfer and dissociation of N(2)((1)Σ(g)(+)) molecules interacting with N((4)S(u)) atoms in an ideal isochoric and isothermal chemical reactor. The system examined is a mixture of molecular nitrogen and a small amount of atomic nitrogen. This mixture, initially at room temperature, is heated by several thousands of degrees Kelvin, driving the system toward a strong non-equilibrium condition. The evolution of the population densities of each individual rovibrational level is explicitly determined via the numerical solution of the master equation for temperatures ranging from 5000 to 50,000 K. The reaction rate coefficients are taken from an ab initio database developed at NASA Ames Research Center. The macroscopic relaxation times, energy transfer rates, and dissociation rate coefficients are extracted from the solution of the master equation. The computed rotational-translational (RT) and vibrational-translational (VT) relaxation times are different at low heat bath temperatures (e.g., RT is about two orders of magnitude faster than VT at T = 5000 K), but they converge to a common limiting value at high temperature. This is contrary to the conventional interpretation of thermal relaxation in which translational and rotational relaxation timescales are assumed comparable with vibrational relaxation being considerable slower. Thus, this assumption is questionable under high temperature non-equilibrium conditions. The exchange reaction plays a very significant role in determining the dynamics of the population densities. The macroscopic energy transfer and dissociation rates are found to be slower when exchange processes are neglected. A macroscopic dissociation rate coefficient based on the quasi-stationary distribution, exhibits excellent agreement with experimental data of Appleton et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 48, 599-608 (1968)]. However, at higher temperatures, only about 50% of dissociation is found to take place under quasi-stationary state conditions. This suggest the necessity of explicitly including some rovibrational levels, when solving a global kinetic rate equation.},

 abstract = {This work is a comprehensive and theoretical study of transport phenomena in partially ionized and unmagnetized plasmas by means of kinetic theory. The pros and cons of different models encountered in the literature are presented. A dimensional analysis of the Boltzmann equation deals with the disparity of mass between electrons and heavy particles and yields the epochal relaxation concept. First, electrons and heavy particles exhibit distinct kinetic time scales and may have different translational temperatures. The hydrodynamic velocity is assumed to be identical for both types of species. Second, at the hydrodynamic time scale the energy exchanged between electrons and heavy particles tends to equalize both temperatures. Global and species macroscopic fluid conservation equations are given. New constrained integral equations are derived from a modified Chapman-Enskog perturbative method. Adequate bracket integrals are introduced to treat thermal nonequilibrium. A symmetric mathematical formalism is preferred for physical and numerical standpoints. A Laguerre-Sonine polynomial expansion allows for systems of transport to be derived. Momentum, mass, and energy fluxes are associated to shear viscosity, diffusion coefficients, thermal diffusion coefficients, and thermal conductivities. A Goldstein expansion of the perturbation function provides explicit expressions of the thermal diffusion ratios and measurable thermal conductivities. Thermal diffusion terms already found in the Russian literature ensure the exact mass conservation. A generalized Stefan-Maxwell equation is derived following the method of Kolesnikov and Tirskiy. The bracket integral reduction in terms of transport collision integrals is presented in Appendix for the thermal nonequilibrium case. A simple Eucken correction is proposed to deal with the internal degrees of freedom of atoms and polyatomic molecules, neglecting inelastic collisions. The authors believe that the final expressions are readily usable for practical applications in fluid dynamics.},

 abstract = {A Boltzmann rovibrational collisional coarse-grained model is proposed to reduce a detailed kinetic mechanism database developed at NASA Ames Research Center for internal energy transfer and dissociation in N(2)-N interactions. The coarse-grained model is constructed by lumping the rovibrational energy levels of the N(2) molecule into energy bins. The population of the levels within each bin is assumed to follow a Boltzmann distribution at the local translational temperature. Excitation and dissociation rate coefficients for the energy bins are obtained by averaging the elementary rate coefficients. The energy bins are treated as separate species, thus allowing for non-Boltzmann distributions of their populations. The proposed coarse-grained model is applied to the study of nonequilibrium flows behind normal shock waves and within converging-diverging nozzles. In both cases, the flow is assumed inviscid and steady. Computational results are compared with those obtained by direct solution of the master equation for the rovibrational collisional model and a more conventional multitemperature model. It is found that the proposed coarse-grained model is able to accurately resolve the nonequilibrium dynamics of internal energy excitation and dissociation-recombination processes with only 20 energy bins. Furthermore, the proposed coarse-grained model provides a superior description of the nonequilibrium phenomena occurring in shock heated and nozzle flows when compared with the conventional multitemperature models.},

This contrasts with the common misconception that translational and rotational relaxation occur concurrently. A significant part of the relaxation process occurs in non-quasi-steady-state conditions. Exchange processes are found to have a significant impact on the relaxation of the gas, while predissociation has a negligible effect. The results obtained by means of the full rovibrational collisional model are used to assess the validity of reduced order models (vibrational collisional and multitemperature) which are based on the same kinetic database. It is found that thermalization and dissociation are drastically overestimated by the reduced order models. The reasons of the failure differ in the two cases. In the vibrational collisional model the overestimation of the dissociation is a consequence of the assumption of equilibrium between the rotational energy and the translational energy. The multitemperature model fails to predict the correct thermochemical relaxation due to the failure of the quasi-steady-state assumption, used to derive the phenomenological rate coefficient for dissociation. },

 abstract = {In the present study, we derive from kinetic theory a unified fluid model for multicomponent plasmas by accounting for the electromagnetic field influence. We deal with a possible thermal nonequilibrium of the translational energy of the particles, neglecting their internal energy and reactive collisions. Given the strong disparity of mass between the electrons and heavy particles, such as molecules, atoms, and ions, we conduct a dimensional analysis of the Boltzmann equation and introduce a scaling based on a multiscale perturbation parameter equal to the square root of the ratio of the electron mass to a characteristic heavy-particle mass. We then generalize the Chapman–Enskog method, emphasizing the role of the perturbation parameter on the collisional operator, the streaming operator, and the collisional invariants of the Boltzmann equation. The system is examined at successive orders of approximation, each corresponding to a physical timescale. At the highest approximation order investigated, the multicomponent Navier–Stokes regime is reached for the heavy particles and is coupled to first-order drift-diffusion equations for the electrons. The transport coefficients are then calculated in terms of bracket operators whose mathematical structure allows for positivity properties to be determined and Onsager's reciprocal relations to hold. The transport coefficients exhibit an anisotropic behavior when the magnetic field is strong enough. We also give a complete description of the Kolesnikov effect, i.e. the crossed contributions to the mass and energy transport fluxes coupling the electrons and heavy particles. Finally, the first and second laws of thermodynamics are proved to be satisfied by deriving a total energy equation and an entropy equation. Moreover, the purely convective system of equations is shown to be hyperbolic.},

A review of available thermodynamic data for species found in mixtures of carbon–phenolic pyrolysis and ablation gases and atmospheres rich with C, H, O, and N such as those of Earth, Mars, Titan, and Venus, is performed. Over 1200 unique chemical species are identified from four widely used thermodynamic databases and a systematic procedure is described for combining these data into a comprehensive model. The detailed dataset is then compared with the Chemical Equilibrium with Applications thermodynamic database developed by NASA in order to quantify the differences in equilibrium thermodynamic properties obtained with the two databases. In addition, a consistent reduction methodology using the mixture thermodynamic properties as an objective function is developed to generate reduced species sets for a variety of temperature, pressure, and elemental composition spaces. It is found that 32 and 23 species are required to model carbon–phenolic pyrolysis gases mixed with air and CO2, respectively, to maintain a maximum error in thermodynamic quantities below 10%.},

 abstract = {Next generation spacecraft will bring back heavier payloads from explored planets. Advance in the modeling of the thermo-chemical ablation of carbon-based thermal protection system materials is fundamental to improve the design capabilities of these vehicles. Computational fluid dynamic approaches are extensively used to model the gas-surface interaction phenomena over ablative materials. The advantage of such kind of approaches is the accurate description of the aerothermal environment obtained through the full resolution of the mechanical, thermal, and chemical boundary layers that develop over an ablative surface when exposed to a high-enthalpy flow. This paper is devoted to the assessment of the uncertainties of such kind of thermo-chemical ablation model and to study their effect on the model final outcomes. A sphere of non-pyrolyzing carbon-based material, exposed to conditions similar to those of a typical plasma wind tunnel test, is the selected test case for the analysis. Two forward non-intrusive uncertainty quantification techniques are used to analyze the influence of the defined set of uncertain parameters on the estimate of steady-state mass blowing flux and surface temperature. Our results show that for the selected conditions, and uncertainty ranges, the surface nitridation reaction probability has the strongest impact on the model outcomes.},

Principal component analysis (PCA) offers a general and rather simple and automated method to reduce large kinetic mechanisms by principal variable selection. This work shows how to adapt and apply the PCA-scores technique, which has its origin in the combustion field, to a collisional-radiative model.

 abstract = {Accurate prediction of the gas-surface interaction during spacecraft reentry remains a challenging problem for thermal protection system design. Attempts to model the surface chemistry of ablating materials focus on oxidation and sublimation of the carbon surface, but usually neglect nitridation processes. Although nitridation may only lead to a minor increase in overall mass loss through ablation, it can highly impact other surface chemical processes through consumption of available atomic nitrogen, affecting the energy balance. We present experiments on graphite ablation in nitrogen plasmas, aiming at the determination of carbon nitridation reaction efficiencies in a relevant reentry environment reproduced in an inductively coupled plasma facility. The actual carbon nitridation reaction efficiencies are extracted using a numerical model with ablative boundary condition coupled to the flowfield. Emission spectroscopy of the CN radiation provides local CN species densities used for validation of the numerical model. The data are in-line with values reported in literature and extend the investigated temperature range. Our computed CN species densities agree well with the experimental values, providing confidence in our method. Based on our findings and additional literature data, we propose an updated Arrhenius form for evaluation of nitridation reaction efficiencies as a function of the wall temperature.},

 abstract = {Considerable effort has been carried out to reduce the complexity of detailed chemistry models for plasma flows. Plasma involves many species and different complex reactions, each of them evolving at a different time-scale. Because of this complexity, numerical simulations often remain restricted to simple zero-or one-dimensional calculations. Different reduction techniques have been developed over the years. Time-scale based reductions are possible through rate-controlled constrained equilibrium methods or singular perturbation methods as investigated by the combustion community. Other techniques aim to limit the number of species. Coarse-grain models resulting from binning methods, for example, have been developed for simulating rovibrational nitrogen chemistry. The energy levels of ab initio databases are being lumped into several bins. The number of governing equations is significantly reduced as the considered species equal the amount of bins.},

 abstract = {A state-to-state model for internal energy exchange and molecular dissociation allows for high-fidelity DSMC simulations. Elementary reaction cross sections for the N2 (v, J)+ N system were previously extracted from a quantum-chemical database, originally compiled at NASA Ames Research Center. Due to the high computational cost of simulating the full range of inelastic collision processes (approx. 23 million reactions), a coarse-grain model, called the Uniform RoVibrational Collisional (URVC) bin model can be used instead. This allows to reduce the original 9390 rovibrational levels of N2 to 10 energy bins. In the present work, this reduced model is used to simulate a 2D flow configuration, which more closely reproduces the conditions of high-speed entry into Earth’s atmosphere. For this purpose, the URVC bin model had to be adapted for integration into the “Rarefied Gas Dynamics Analysis System” (RGDAS), a separate high-performance DSMC code capable of handling complex geometries and parallel computations. RGDAS was developed at the Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics in Novosibirsk, Russia for use by the European Space Agency (ESA) and shares many features with the well-known SMILE code developed by the same group. We show that the reduced mechanism developed previously can be implemented in RGDAS, and the results exhibit nonequilibrium effects consistent with those observed in previous 1D-simulations.},

 abstract = {Accurate characterization of the hypersonic flow around a vehicle during its atmospheric entry is important for a precise quantification of heat flux margins. In some cases, exothermic reactions promoted by the catalytic properties of the surface material can significantly contribute to the overall heat flux. In this work, the effect of catalytic recombination of atomic nitrogen is examined within the framework of a state-specific DSMC implementation. State-to-state reaction cross sections are derived from a detailed quantum-chemical database for the N2(v, J) + N system. A coarse-grain model is used to reduce the number of internal states and state-specific reactions to a manageable level. The catalytic boundary condition is based on an phenomenological approach and the state-specific surface recombination probabilities can be imposed by the user. This can represent an important aspect in modelling catalysis, since experiments and molecular dynamics suggest that only part of the chemical energy is absorbed by the wall, with the formed molecules leaving the surface in an excited state. The implementation is verified in a simplified geometrical configuration by comparing the numerical results with an analytical solution, developed for a 1D diffusion problem in a binary mixture. Then, the effect of catalysis in a hypersonic flow along the stagnation line of a blunt body is studied.},

 abstract = {We derive a hydrodynamic model for the internal energy excitation of molecular gases in thermal nonequilibrium based on kinetic theory. The co-existence of fast and slow collisions in the system results in thermal nonequilibrium between the translational and internal energy modes. A proper scaling for the Boltzmann equation that accounts for the different relaxation times is obtained from a dimensional analysis. The collisions are divided into fast and slow processes based on the magnitude of the net internal energy. As opposed to conventional perturbations methods, the fast collision operator is expanded in a small parameter used to define the threshold for the net energy for fast collisions. A lemma allows us to split the internal energy of all the levels into perturbed elastic and inelastic contributions for the fast collisions. The introduction of perturbed energy levels is crucial to separate the energy collision invariant into two types of fast collisional invariants. The gas particle population is shown to thermalize to a quasi-equilibrium state described by a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution function with distinct translational energy temperature and internal energy temperature. The role of the fast collisions is the thermalization of the translational and internal energy modes. Euler equations for the conservation of the mass, momentum, translational energy, and internal energy are also derived. The role of the slow collisions is to contribute to the thermal relaxation of the translational and internal energy modes.},

 abstract = {A statistical model originally developed for electronic-translational energy transfer in atoms having multiple electronic states (Anderson et al, RGD15, 1986) is applied to the study of internal energy exchange in a polyatomic gas. The model is well-suited for gas kinetic simulations, because it provides an explicit expression for the transition probabilities between internal energy levels. All molecules possessing a given internal energy level are treated as a separate chemical species and all collisions involving exchange of internal energy thus become pseudo-chemical reactions. Post-collision energy levels of the two partners are determined by conserving the total energy of the collision pair and taking into account detailed balance. In the present work, DSMC simulations of relaxation in a stationary gas are performed and compared to those obtained by Anderson et al. Additionally, we apply the model to the simulation of rotational relaxation behind a normal shock wave.},

 abstract = {The postflight analysis of a space mission requires accurate determination of the free-stream conditions for the trajectory. The Mach number, temperature, and pressure conditions can be rebuilt from the heat flux and pressure measured on the spacecraft by means of a Flush Air Data System (FADS). This instrumentation comprises a set of sensors flush mounted in the thermal protection system to measure the static pressure (pressure taps) and heat flux (calorimeters). Knowing that experimental data suffer from errors, this methodology needs to integrate quantification of uncertainties. Epistemic uncertainties on the models for chemistry in the bulk and at the wall (surface catalysis) should also be taken into account. To study this problem it is necessary to solve a stochastic backward problem. This paper focuses on a preliminary sensitivity analysis of the forward problem to understand which uncertainties need to be accounted for. In section 2, the uncertainty quantification methodologies used in this work are presented. Section 3 is dedicated to the one-dimensional (1D) simulations of the shock layer to identify which chemical reactions of the mechanism need to be accounted for in the Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). After this triage procedure, the two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric flow around the blunt nose was simulated for two trajectory points of EXPERT (EXPErimental Reentry Test-bed) is simulated and the propagation of the uncertainties on the stagnation pressure and heat flux has been studied. To do this study, the open source software DAKOTA from Sandia National Laboratory [1] is coupled with two in-house codes: SHOCKING that simulates the evolution of the chemical relaxation in the shock layer [2], and COSMIC that simulates axisymmetric chemically reacting flows [3].},

 abstract = {Quantifying the catalytic properties of reusable thermal protection system materials is essential for the design of atmospheric entry vehicles. Their properties quantify the recombination of oxygen and nitrogen atoms into molecules, and allow for accurate computation of the heat flux to the spacecraft. Their rebuilding from ground test data, however, is not straightforward and subject to uncertainties. We propose a fully Bayesian approach to reconstruct the catalytic properties of ceramic matrix composites from sparse high-enthalpy facility experimental data with uncertainty estimates. The results are compared to those obtained by means of an alternative reconstruction procedure, where the experimental measurements are also treated as random variables but propagated through a deterministic solver. For the testing conditions presented in this work, the contribution to the measured heat flux of the molecular recombination is negligible. Therefore, the material catalytic property cannot be estimated precisely. Moreover, epistemic uncertainties are rigorously included, such as the unknown reference calorimeter catalytic property.},

 abstract = {The present work introduces a novel approach for obtaining reduced chemistry representations of large kinetic mechanisms in strong non-equilibrium conditions. The need for accurate reduced-order models arises from compression of large ab initio quantum chemistry databases for their use in fluid codes. The method presented in this paper builds on existing physics-based strategies and proposes a new approach based on the combination of a simple coarse grain model with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The internal energy levels of the chemical species are regrouped in distinct energy groups with a uniform lumping technique. Following the philosophy of machine learning, PCA is applied on the training data provided by the coarse grain model to find an optimally reduced representation of the full kinetic mechanism. Compared to recently published complex lumping strategies, no expert judgment is required before the application of PCA. In this work, we will demonstrate the benefits of the combined approach, stressing its simplicity, reliability, and accuracy. The technique is demonstrated by reducing the complex quantum N<sub>2</sub>(Σg+1)-N(Su4) database for studying molecular dissociation and excitation in strong non-equilibrium. Starting from detailed kinetics, an accurate reduced model is developed and used to study non-equilibrium properties of the N<sub>2</sub>(Σg+1)-N(Su4) system in shock relaxation simulations.},

 abstract = { Ablative materials are extensively used in aerospace applications to protect the integrity of the spacecraft during atmospheric entry. Both thermal and mechanical stresses have to be withstood in the severe operating conditions typical of space missions. An accurate modeling of the phenomena taking place when these materials are exposed to such a harsh environment is crucial to ensure the success of future, more demanding, missions. This study aims to couple two tools able to handle two different aspects of the ablative material modeling: a stagnation-line flow solver featuring an integrated ablative boundary condition, and a material response code. The coupling algorithm allows for time accurate solutions of the ablative material thermal response accounting for detailed surface chemistry, in-depth material behavior, and surface recession. Two different coupling strategies have been implemented, based either on a direct or an iterative procedure. The developed tool is used to rebuild plasma wind tunnel experiments performed in the von Karman Institute Plasmatron facility. The outcomes of the two strategies are compared, showing a satisfactory agreement with the experimental data. Among the two analyzed coupling procedures, the direct coupling proved to be computationally less expensive, while conserving the same accuracy of the more complex iterative procedure for the analyzed cases. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to understand the discrepancy with experimental data and show the effects of four uncertain material parameters: thermal conductivity, density, emissivity, and catalytic efficiency.},

 abstract = {We propose to couple a state-resolved rovibrational coarse-grain model to a stochastic particle method for simulating internal energy excitation and dissociation of a molecular gas. A coarse-grained model for a rovibrational reaction mechanism of an <i>ab initio</i> database developed at the NASA Ames Research Center for the N<sub>2</sub>-N system is modified based on variably spaced energy bins. The thermodynamic properties of the modified coarse-grained model allow us to closely match those obtained with the full set of rovibrational levels over a wide temperature range, while using a number of bins significantly smaller than the complete mechanism. The chemical-kinetic behavior of equally and variably spaced bin formulations is compared by simulating internal energy excitation and dissociation of nitrogen in an adiabatic, isochoric reactor. We find that the variably spaced formulation is better suited for reproducing the dynamics of the full database at conditions of interest in the Earth atmospheric entry. Also in this paper, we discuss the details of our particle method implementation for the uniform rovibrational collisional bin model and describe changes to the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) collision algorithm, which become necessary to accommodate our state-resolved reaction mechanism for excitation and dissociation reactions. The DSMC code is then verified against equivalent master equation calculations. In these simulations, state-resolved cross sections are used in analytical form. These cross sections verify micro-reversibility relations for the rovibrational bins and allow for fast execution of the DSMC code. In our verification calculations, we obtain very close agreement for the concentrations profiles of N and N<sub>2</sub>, as well as the translational and rovibrational mode temperatures obtained independently through both methods. In addition to macroscopic moments, we compare discrete internal energy populations predicted at selected time steps via DSMC and the master equations. We observe good agreement between the two sets of results within the limits imposed by statistical scatter, which is inherent to particle-based DSMC solutions. As future work, the rovibrational coarse-grain model coupled to the particle method will allow us to study 3D reentry flow configurations.},

 abstract = {This contribution deals with the fluid modeling of multicomponent magnetized plasmas in thermo-chemical non-equilibrium from the partially- to fully-ionized collisional regimes, aiming at the predictive simulation of magnetic reconnection in Sun chromosphere conditions. Such fluid models are required for large-scale simulations by relying on high performance computing. The fluid model is derived from a kinetic theory approach, yielding a rigorous description of the dissipative and non-equilibrium effects and a well-identified mathematical structure. We start from a general system of equations that is obtained by means of a multiscale Chapman-Enskog method, based on a non-dimensional analysis accounting for the mass disparity between the electrons and heavy particles, including the influence of the electromagnetic field and transport properties. The latter are computed by using a spectral Galerkin method based on a converged Laguerre-Sonine polynomial approximation. Then, in the limit of small Debye length with respect to the characteristic scale in the Sun chromosphere, we derive a two-temperature single-momentum multicomponent diffusion model coupled to Maxwell's equations, which is able to describe fully- and partially-ionized plasmas, beyond the multi-fluid model of Braginskii, valid for the whole range of the Sun chromosphere conditions. The second contribution is the development and verification of an accurate and robust numerical strategy that is based on CanoP, a massively parallel code with adaptive mesh refinement capability, which is able to cope with the full spectrum of scales of the magnetic reconnection process, without additional constraint on the time steps compared to single-fluid Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) models. The final contribution is a study of the physics of magnetic reconnection in collaboration with the heliophysics team of NASA Ames Research Center. We show that the model and methods allow us to retrieve the results of usual single-fluid MHD models in the highly collisional case at equilibrium, while achieving a more detailed physics description relevant to such applications in the weakly collisional case, where non-equilibrium effects become important.},

 abstract = {Various methodologies used to derive free-stream conditions in hypersonic wind tunnels using different sets of experimental inputs are reviewed. The accuracy of a relevant but seldom used approach, involving free-stream static pressure measurements, is improved in the present work by solving numerically shock conservation equations and by accounting for the high-temperature effects typically expected in hypersonic flows (vibrational excitation, dissociation, and ionization). The numerical method implemented is also extended to handle free-stream thermal non-equilibrium provided that free-stream vibrational temperature measurements are available. The performances of the present approach are evaluated against conventional methods by determining free-stream flow properties in the von Karman Institute Longshot hypersonic wind tunnel. Uncertainties are quantified for each of the derived free-stream flow conditions. It is demonstrated that methodologies limited to Pitot pressure diagnostics in the test section fail to detect departures from ideal nozzle flow expansions, due to their inherent isentropic flow assumptions. Involving free-stream static pressure diagnostics does, however, improve the results, as validated by independent investigations. It is shown that the non-ideal nozzle flow expansion is not induced by free-stream thermal non-equilibrium since this phenomenon leads to opposite trends on free-stream flow properties with respect to those observed. Overall, free-stream static pressure probes represent a useful complement and their benefits for free-stream rebuilding methodologies are emphasized. The present free-stream rebuilding methodology is recommended to enhance the relevance of every hypersonic ground experiment.},

Coupling detailed chemical mechanisms to flow solvers is computationally expensive and often limits their application to 1D simulations. We develop an efficient Lagrangian diffusive reactor moving along the streamlines of a steady baseline flow simulation to compute detailed thermochemical effects. In addition to its efficiency, the method allows us to model both continuum and rarefied flows, while including mass and energy diffusion. The Lagrangian solver is assessed for several testcases including strong normal shockwaves, as well as 2D and axisymmetric blunt-body hypersonic rarefied flows. In all the testcases performed, the Lagrangian reactor improves drastically the baseline simulations. The computational cost of a Lagrangian recomputation is typically orders of magnitude smaller with respect to a full solution of the problem. The solver has the additional benefit of being immune from statistical noise, which strongly affects the accuracy of calculations obtained by means of the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method, especially considering minor species in the mixture. The results demonstrate that the method enables applying detailed mechanisms to multidimensional solvers to study thermochemical nonequilibrium flows.},

For the first time with the specific experimental setup, the resulting material has been recovered, studied, and compared with natural analogues, focusing on the thermal and redox reactions triggered by interaction between the melt and the atmospheric gases under high temperature and low pressure conditions. Experimental conditions were tested across a range of parameters, such as heat flux, experiment duration, and pressure, using two types of sample holders materials, namely cork and graphite. A basalt served as asteroidal analog and to calibrate the experiments, before melting a H5 ordinary chondrite meteorite. The quenched melt recovered after the experiments has been analyzed by μ-XRF, EDS-SEM, EMPA, LA-ICP-MS, and XANES spectroscopy. The glass formed from the basalt is fairly homogeneous, depleted in highly volatile elements (e.g., Na, K), relatively enriched in moderately siderophile elements (e.g., Co, Ni), and has reached an equilibrium redox state with a lower Fe3+/Fetot ratio than that in the starting material. Spherical objects, enriched in SiO2, Na2O and K2O, were observed, inferring condensation from the vaporized material. Despite instantaneous quenching, the melt formed from the ordinary chondrite shows extensive crystallization of mostly olivine and magnetite, the latter indicative of oxygen fugacity compatible with presence of both Fe2+ and Fe3+. Similar features have been observed in natural meteorite fusion crusts and in micrometeorites, implying that, at least in terms of maximum temperature reached and chemical reactions, the experiments have successfully reproduced the conditions likely encountered by extraterrestrial material following atmospheric entry.},

 abstract = {Meteoroids largely disintegrate during their entry into the atmosphere, contributing significantly to the input of cosmic material to Earth. Yet, their atmospheric entry is not well understood. Experimental studies on meteoroid material degradation in high-enthalpy facilities are scarce and when the material is recovered after testing, it rarely provides sufficient quantitative data for the validation of simulation tools. In this work, we investigate the thermo-chemical degradation mechanism of a meteorite in a high-enthalpy ground facility able to reproduce atmospheric entry conditions. A testing methodology involving measurement techniques previously used for the characterization of thermal protection systems for spacecraft is adapted for the investigation of ablation of alkali basalt (employed here as meteorite analog) and ordinary chondrite samples. Both materials are exposed to a cold-wall stagnation point heat flux of 1.2 MW m−2. Numerous local pockets that formed on the surface of the samples by the emergence of gas bubbles reveal the frothing phenomenon characteristic of material degradation. Time-resolved optical emission spectroscopy data of ablated species allow us to identify the main radiating atoms and ions of potassium, calcium, magnesium, and iron. Surface temperature measurements provide maximum values of 2280 K for the basalt and 2360 K for the chondrite samples. We also develop a material response model by solving the heat conduction equation and accounting for evaporation and oxidation reaction processes in a 1D Cartesian domain. The simulation results are in good agreement with the data collected during the experiments, highlighting the importance of iron oxidation to the material degradation.},

 abstract = {In the present contribution, we derive from kinetic theory a unified fluid
model for multicomponent plasmas by accounting for the electromagnetic field
influence. We deal with a possible thermal nonequilibrium of the translational
energy of the particles, neglecting their internal energy and the reactive
collisions. Given the strong disparity of mass between the electrons and heavy
particles, such as molecules, atoms, and ions, we conduct a dimensional
analysis of the Boltzmann equation. We then generalize the Chapman-Enskog
method, emphasizing the role of a multiscale perturbation parameter on the
collisional operator, the streaming operator, and the collisional invariants of
the Boltzmann equation. The system is examined at successive orders of
approximation, each of which corresponding to a physical time scale. The
multicomponent Navier-Stokes regime is reached for the heavy particles, which
follow a hyperbolic scaling, and is coupled to first order drift-diffusion
equations for the electrons, which follow a parabolic scaling. The transport
coefficients exhibit an anisotropic behavior when the magnetic field is strong
enough. We also give a complete description of the Kolesnikov effect, i.e., the
crossed contributions to the mass and energy transport fluxes coupling the
electrons and heavy particles. Finally, the first and second principles of
thermodynamics are proved to be satisfied by deriving a total energy equation
and an entropy equation. Moreover, the system of equations is shown to be
conservative and the purely convective system hyperbolic, thus leading to a
well-defined structure.},

multi-energy level gas is proposed. Internal energy levels are treated as
separate species and inelastic collisions (leading to internal energy
excitation and relaxation) are accounted for. The formulation developed can
also be used for the case of a mixture of monatomic gases without internal
energy (where only elastic collisions occur). The advantage of the
spectral-Lagrangian method lies in the generality of the algorithm in use for
the evaluation of the elastic and inelastic collision operators. The
computational procedure is based on the Fourier transform of the partial
elastic and inelastic collision operators and exploits the fact that these can
be written as weighted convolutions in Fourier space with no restriction on the
cross- section model. The conservation of mass, momentum and energy during
collisions is enforced through the solution of constrained optimization
problems. Numerical solutions are obtained for both space homogeneous and space
in- homogeneous problems. Computational results are compared with those
obtained by means of the DSMC method in order to assess the accuracy of the

performed, the Lagrangian reactor improves drastically the baseline

orders of magnitude smaller with respect to a full solution of the problem. The
solver has the additional benefit of being immune from statistical noise, which
strongly affects the accuracy of DSMC simulations, especially considering minor

 abstract = {We present a novel numerical scheme for the efficient and accurate solution
of the isothermal two-fluid (electron and ion) equations coupled to Poisson's
equation for low-temperature plasmas. The model considers electrons and ions as
separate fluids, comprising the electron inertia and charge separation. The
discretization of this system with standard explicit schemes is constrained by
very restrictive time steps and cell sizes related to the resolution of the
Debye length, electron plasma frequency, and electron sound waves. Both sheath
and electron inertia are fundamental to fully explain the physics in
low-pressure and low-temperature plasmas. However, most of the phenomena of
interest for fluid models occur at speeds much slower than the electron thermal
speed and are quasi-neutral, except in small charged regions. In this work, we
present a scheme based on the Lagrange-projection operator splitting that
preserves the asymptotic regime where the plasma is quasi-neutral with massless
electrons. As a result, the quasi-neutral regime is treated without the need of
an implicit solver nor the resolution of the Debye length and electron plasma
frequency. Additionally, the scheme proves to accurately represent the dynamics
of the electrons both at low speeds and when the electron speed is comparable
to the thermal speed. In addition, a well-balanced treatment of the ion source
terms is proposed in order to tackle problems where the ion temperature is very
low compared to the electron temperature. The scheme significantly improves the
accuracy both in the quasi-neutral limit and in the presence of plasma sheaths
when the Debye length is resolved. The scheme is assessed in two specifically
designed test-cases: a quasi-neutral two-stream periodic perturbation with
analytical solution and a low-temperature discharge that includes sheaths.},

an extended range of validity for the Sun chromosphere conditions. We compute
consistent transport properties by means of a spectral Galerkin method using
the Laguerre-Sonine polynomial approximation. Two non-vanishing polynomial
terms are used when deriving the transport systems for electrons, whereas only
one term is retained for heavy particles. In a simplified framework where the
plasma is fully ionized, we compare the transport properties for the Sun
chromosphere to conventional expressions for magnetized plasmas due to
Braginskii, showing a good agreement between both results. For more general
partially ionized conditions, representative of the Sun chromosphere, we
compute the muticomponent transport properties corresponding to the species
diffusion velocities, heavy-particle and electron heat fluxes, and viscous
stress tensor of the model, for a Helium-Hydrogen mixture in local
thermodynamic equilibrium. The model is assessed for the 3D radiative
magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a pore, in the highly turbulent upper layer
of the solar convective zone. The resistive term is found to dominate mainly
the dynamics of the electric field at the pore location. The battery term for
heavy particles appears to be higher at the pore location and at some

 abstract = {In this paper, we present a method to generate state-resolved reaction cross
sections in analytical form for rovibrational energy excitation and
dissociation of a molecular gas. The method is applied to an ab initio database
for the N2-N system devel- oped at NASA Ames Research Center. The detailed
information on N2 +N collisions contained in this database has been reduced by
adapting a Uniform RoVibrational- Collisional bin model originally developed
for rate coefficients. Using a 10-bin system as an example, a comparison is
made between two sets of coarse-grain cross sections, obtained by analytical
inversion and direct binning respectively. The analytical in- version approach
is especially powerful, because it manages to compress the entire set of
rovibrational-level-specific data from the Ames database into a much smaller
set of numerical parameters, sufficient to reconstruct all coarse-grain cross
sections for any particular N2 +N-collision pair. As a result of this approach,
the computational cost in in large-scale Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)
flow simulations is sig- nificantly reduced, both in terms of memory
requirements and execution time. The intended application is the simulation of
high-temperature gas-dynamics phenomena in shock-heated flows via the DSMC
method. Such conditions are typically encoun- tered in high-altitude,
high-speed atmospheric entry, or in shock-tube experiments. Using this
coarse-grain model together with ab initio rate data will enable more accu-
rate modeling nonequilibrium phenomena, such as vibrationally-favored
dissociation, an effect that is not well-captured by the conventional models
prevalent in DSMC (i.e. Larsen-Borgnakke and Total Collision Energy).},

NASA Ames ab initio database for the N2-N system is modified using
variably-spaced energy bins. Thermodynamic properties of the new coarse-grained

at conditions of interest in Earth reentry. Furthermore, we discuss details of
our Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) implementation for the coarse-grain

our state-resolved reaction mechanism. The DSMC code is then verified against
equivalent master equation (ME) calculations. In these simulations,
state-resolved cross sections are used in analytical form. They verify
micro-reversibility for the bins and allow for faster execution of the code. In
our verification, we obtain very close agreement for the N and N2
concentrations, as well as the translational and rovibrational mode
temperatures obtained independently using both methods. In addition to
macroscopic moments, we compare internal energy populations predicted at
selected time steps via DSMC and ME. We observe good agreement between both

the rovibrational coarse-grain model coupled to the particle method will allow
us to study 3D reentry flow configurations.},

By means of a third-order accuracy time-dependent finite volume scheme, we solve the isothermal multi-fluid equations with realistic ion-to-electron mass ratios. We propose a numerical procedure and boundary conditions that retrieve a steady-state solution of a planar 1D floating sheath. The classical solution to this problem neglects the ion temperature since the model equations present a singularity for a finite ion temperature. The multi-fluid simulations provide a rigorous solution to the plasma-sheath transition without singularities. We compare our solution to the classical theory, finding perfect agreement when the ion-to-electron temperature tends to zero. We discuss the effect of the ion temperature, the electron inertia, and the elastic collisions with neutrals in low-pressure plasmas. Finally, relying on a kinetic approach, we derive analytical expressions for the electron macroscopic quantities inside a steady sheath that assumes a truncated Maxwellian electron velocity distribution function (EVDF) with a wall that collects the electron random flux. The derived analytical expressions are beyond the classical isothermal solution with Boltzmann electrons. The isothermal multi-fluid solution captures properly the first two moments of the EVDF inside the sheath. Our analytical expressions show the need for solving for higher-order moments to fully explain the electron physics inside the sheath, as opposite to the classical isothermal assumption. This work demonstrates that the multi-fluid simulations are able to capture the plasma-sheath transition under weakly collisional conditions with a solution that is consistent with the classical and the kinetic theory.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT
                  Due to their small size and tremendous speeds, meteoroids often burn up at high altitudes above 80 km, where the atmosphere is rarefied. Ground radio stations allow us to detect the concentration of electrons in the meteoroid trail, which are produced by hyperthermal collisions of ablated species with the freestream. The interpretation of these data currently relies on phenomenological methods, derived under the assumption of free molecular flow, that poorly accounts for the detailed chemistry, diffusion in the vapour phase, and rarefied gas effects. In this work, we employ the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method to analyse the detailed flowfield structure in the surroundings of a 1 mm meteoroid at different conditions, spanning a broad spectrum of Knudsen and Mach numbers, and we extract resulting ionization efficiencies. For this purpose, we couple the DSMC method with a kinetic boundary condition which models evaporation and condensation processes in a silicate material. Transport properties of the ablated vapour are computed following the Chapman–Enskog theory starting from Lennard–Jones potentials. Semi-empirical inelastic cross-sections for heavy- and electron-impact ionization of metals are computed analytically to obtain steric factors. The ionization of sodium is dominant in the production of free electrons, and hyperthermal air–vapour collisions play the most important role in this process. The ionization of air, classically disregarded, contributes to the electron production as significantly as ionization of magnesium and iron. Finally, we propose that DSMC could be employed as a numerical experiment providing ionization coefficients to be used in synthetic models.},

The SU2 CFD solver has been coupled to the Mutation++ library to simulate these interaction mechanisms for different gas mixtures accounting for thermochemical nonequilibrium. A systematic numerical study is performed to evaluate how shock interference patterns differ from Edney’s classification when air and CO2 mixtures are considered. Moreover, the impact of varying the freestream temperature is analysed. Results show that, for a freestream temperature of 57 K, a Type V nine-shock configuration and a Type VI-V transition is identified for air and CO2 flows, respectively. For a freestream temperature of 300 K, the same Type VI-V transition is obtained for the CO2 flow with a slightly different shape, whereas a Type V six-shock configuration is obtained for air. It is concluded that increasing the freestream temperature from 57 K to 300 K has more impact on the extent of thermochemical nonequilibrium of an air flow than of a CO2 flow, and consequently on the resulting interaction patterns. Moreover, thermal nonequilibrium is shown to be overall stronger for air than for CO2.},

                    Aims.
                    We present a fluid model that has been developed for multicomponent two-temperature magnetized plasmas in chemical non-equilibrium for the partially to fully ionized collisional regimes. We focus on transport phenomena with the aim of representing the atmosphere of the Sun.
                  
                  
                    Methods.
                    This study is based on an asymptotic fluid model for multicomponent plasmas derived from kinetic theory, yielding a rigorous description of the dissipative effects. The governing equations and consistent transport properties are obtained using a multiscale Chapman-Enskog perturbative solution to the Boltzmann equation based on a dimensional analysis. The mass disparity between free electrons and heavy particles is accounted for, as well as the influence of the electromagnetic field. We couple this model to the Maxwell equations for the electromagnetic field and derive the generalized Ohm’s law for multicomponent plasmas. The model inherits a well-identified mathematical structure leading to an extended range of validity for the Sun’s atmospheric conditions. We compute consistent transport properties by means of a spectral Galerkin method using the Laguerre-Sonine polynomial approximation. Two non-vanishing polynomial terms are used when deriving the transport systems for electrons, whereas only one term is retained for heavy particles.
                  
                  
                    Results.
                    In a simplified framework where the plasma is fully ionized, we compare the transport properties for the lower solar atmosphere to conventional expressions for magnetized plasmas attributed to Braginskii, showing a good agreement between both results. For more general partially ionized conditions, representative of the lower solar atmosphere, we compute the muticomponent transport properties corresponding to the species diffusion velocities, heavy-particle and electron heat fluxes, and viscous stress tensor of the model for a helium-hydrogen mixture in local thermodynamic equilibrium. The model is assessed for the 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a pore at the Sun photosphere. The resistive term is found to dominate mainly the dynamics of the electric field at the pore location. The battery term for heavy particles appears to be higher at the pore location and at some intergranulation boundaries.

 abstract = {We present a method to generate analytical coarse-grain cross sections for internal energy excitation and dissociation of nitrogen and apply it to the NASA Ames N 2 - N ab initio database. State-resolved cross sections from this database are reduced using the Uniform RoVibrational-Collisional bin model. With a 10-bin system as example we compare two sets of coarse-grain cross sections: one obtained by analytical inversion and another by direct binning. With analytical inversion we manage to compress the entire set of state-resolved data into a small set of parameters, sufficient to reconstruct the main features of the full database. This has the potential of massively reducing the computational cost in large-scale direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) calculations, both concerning memory requirements and execution time. Combining this coarse-grain model with the N 2 - N ab initio database will enable much higher-fidelity DSMC simulation of nonequilibrium dissociation in shock-heated flows than is currently possible with conventional models.},

 abstract = {Carbon/phenolic ablators are successfully used as thermal protection material for spacecraft. Nevertheless, their complex thermal degradation is not yet fully understood, and current pyrolysis models do not reproduce important features of available experimental results. Accurate and robust thermal degradation models are required to optimize design margin policy. We investigate whether the competitive kinetic schemes commonly used to model biomass pyrolysis are appropriate to describe the thermal degradation of carbon/phenolic composites. In this paper, we apply competitive pyrolysis mechanisms for the thermal degradation of the carbon/phenolic ablator PICA. Model parameters are then calibrated using a robust two-step methodology: first deterministic optimization is used to obtain the best estimation of the calibration parameters based on the experimental data, then a stochastic Bayesian inference is performed to explore plausible set of solutions taking into account the experimental uncertainties. The proposed calibrated model provides an accurate description of the pyrolysis process at different heating rates. The model shows great flexibility and robustness at a similar computational cost as the traditional devolatilization models. This opens the possibility for more complex mechanisms when more experimental data becomes available.},

                    Context.
                    Composition, mass, and trajectory parameters of meteors can be derived by combining observations with the meteor physics equations. The fidelity of these equations, which rely on heuristic coefficients, significantly affects the accuracy of the properties inferred.
                  
                  
                    Aims.
                    Our objective is to present a methodology that can be used to compute the luminosity of meteor entry based on detailed flow simulations in the continuum regime.
                  
                  
                    Methods.
                    The methodology consists in solving the Navier–Stokes equations using state-of-the-art physico-chemical models for hypersonic flows. It includes accurate boundary conditions to simulate the surface evaporation of the molten material and coupled flow-radiation effects. Such detailed simulations allow for the calculation of heat-transfer coefficients and luminous efficiency, which can be incorporated into the meteor physics equations. Finally, we integrate the radiative transfer equation over a line of sight from the ground to the meteor to derive the luminosity magnitude.
                  
                  
                    Results.
                    We use the developed methodology to simulate the Lost City bolide and to derive the luminosity magnitude, obtaining good agreement between numerical results and observations. The computed color index is more prominent than the observations. This is attributed to a lack of refractory elements such as Ca in the modeled flow that might originate from the vaporization of droplets in the trail, a phenomenon currently not included in the model.

These models suffer from a lack of validation and physical description of the flow and material fields, as well as their coupling. In this paper, we develop a model for meteoroid ablation including melting and vaporization, where both flow and material are coupled. We apply the model to ground experiments carried out at the arc jet facilities at NASA Ames Research Center. These experiments reveal a substantial effect of the shear ablation on the ablation process, which the heuristic models do not describe. Due to scarce data on physicochemical material properties at high temperatures, we perform a sensitivity analysis, showing that the material thermal conductivity and viscosity are essential parameters for the shear ablation process. We also observe that the direct evaporation phenomenon is negligible compared to the mass loss by shear ablation. Our models are used to compute an effective heat of ablation six times smaller than the one reported in the literature. These models can be applied to study meteor trajectories and to improve coefficients used in heuristic models.},

 abstract = {We present a novel numerical scheme for the efficient and accurate solution of the isothermal two-fluid (electron + ion) equations coupled to Poisson's equation for low-temperature plasmas at low-pressure. The model considers electrons and ions as separate fluids, comprising the electron inertia and space charge regions. The discretization of this system with standard explicit schemes is constrained by very restrictive time steps and cell sizes related to the resolution of the Debye length, electron plasma frequency, and electron sound waves. Both sheath and electron inertia are fundamental to fully explain the physics in low-pressure and low-temperature plasmas. However, most of the phenomena of interest for fluid models occur at speeds much slower than the electron thermal speed and are quasi-neutral, except in small charged regions. A numerical method that is able to simulate efficiently and accurately all these regimes is a challenge due to the multiscale character of the problem. In this work, we present a scheme based on the Lagrange-projection operator splitting that preserves the asymptotic regime where the plasma is quasi-neutral with massless electrons. As a result, the quasi-neutral regime is treated without the need of an implicit solver nor the resolution of the Debye length and electron plasma frequency. Additionally, the scheme proves to accurately represent the dynamics of the electrons both at low speeds and when the electron speed is comparable to the thermal speed. In addition, a well-balanced treatment of the ion source terms is proposed in order to tackle problems where the ion temperature is very low compared to the electron temperature. The scheme significantly improves the accuracy both in the quasi-neutral limit and in the presence of plasma sheaths when the Debye length is resolved. In order to assess the performance of the scheme in low-temperature plasmas conditions, we propose two specifically designed test-cases: a quasi-neutral two-stream periodic perturbation with analytical solution and a low-temperature discharge that includes sheaths. The numerical strategy, its accuracy, and computational efficiency are assessed on these two discriminating configurations.},

                    Context.
                    Radio-based techniques allow for a meteor detection of 24 h. Electromagnetic waves are scattered by the electrons produced by the ablated species colliding with the incoming air. As the electrons dissipate in the trail, the received signal decays. The interpretation of these measurements entails complex physical modelling of the flow.
                  
                  
                    Aims.
                    In this work, we present a procedure to compute extensive meteor trails in the rarefied segment of the trajectory. This procedure is a general and standalone methodology, which provides meteor physical parameters at given trajectory conditions, without the need to rely on phenomenological lumped models.
                  
                  
                    Methods.
                    We started from fully kinetic simulations of the evaporated gas that describe the nonequilibrium in the flow and the ionisation collisions experienced by metals in their encounter with air molecules. These simulations were employed as initial conditions for performing detailed chemical and multicomponent diffusion calculations of the extended trail, in order to study the processes which lead to the extinction of the plasma. In particular, we focused on the evolution of the trail generated by a 1 mm meteoroid flying at 32 km s
                    −1
                    , above 80 km. We retrieved the ambipolar diffusion coefficient and the electron line density and compared the outcome of our computations with classical results and observational fittings. Finally, the electron field was employed to estimate the resulting reflected signal, using classical radio-echo theory for underdense meteors.
                  
                  
                    Results.
                    A global and constant diffusion coefficient is sufficient to reproduce numerical profiles. A good agreement is found when we compare the extracted diffusion coefficients with theory and observations.

 abstract = {This work deals with the inference of catalytic recombination parameters from
plasma wind tunnel experiments for reusable thermal protection materials. One
of the critical factors affecting the performance of such materials is the
contribution to the heat flux of the exothermic recombination reactions at the
vehicle surface. The main objective of this work is to develop a dedicated
Bayesian framework that allows us to compare uncertain measurements with model
predictions which depend on the catalytic parameter values. Our framework
accounts for uncertainties involved in the model definition and incorporates
all measured variables with their respective uncertainties. The physical model
used for the estimation consists of a 1D boundary layer solver along the
stagnation line. The chemical production term included in the surface mass
balance depends on the catalytic recombination efficiency. As not all the
different quantities needed to simulate a reacting boundary layer can be
measured or known (such as the flow enthalpy at the inlet boundary), we propose
an optimization procedure built on the construction of the likelihood function
to determine their most likely values based on the available experimental data.
This procedure avoids the need to introduce any a priori estimates on the
nuisance quantities, namely, the boundary layer edge enthalpy, wall
temperatures, static and dynamic pressures, which would entail the use of very
wide priors. We substitute the optimal likelihood of the experimental data with
a surrogate model to make the inference procedure both faster and more robust.
We show that the resulting Bayesian formulation yields meaningful and accurate
posterior distributions of the catalytic parameters with a reduction of more
than 20% of the standard deviation with respect to previous works. We also
study the implications of an extension of the experimental procedure.},

Hypersonic computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are performed with a simplified chemical model including only neutral species, in order to calculate the flow field surrounding the ExoMars Schiapparelli module in flight conditions. A novel decoupled CFD approach is then applied where the calculation of the electron density is performed separately using a computationally inexpensive Lagrangian approach. Subsequently, a ray tracing algorithm is applied in order to model the propagation of electromagnetic waves in the wake flow past the ExoMars vehicle accounting for collisions between electrons and gas particles. The numerical results of the proposed novel approach for blackout analysis consisting of CFD, Lagrangian and ray tracing algorithms are in good agreement with the flight data.

operator, whereas the gas chemical processes rely on a reactive collision
operator. We obtain an asymptotic fluid model by means of a Chapman-Enskog

momentum, and energy are given, as well as expressions of the transport
properties. Reversibility relations for elementary processes are formulated in
the coarse-grain model at the kinetic level and are enforced in the collision
algorithm of the direct simulation Monte Carlo method used to solve the kinetic

deriving a fluid model that is well-posed and compatible with the second law of

 abstract = {Simulations of atmospheric entry of spacecraft and satellites require accurate knowledge of thermo-physical properties such as heat capacity in a wide temperature range. However, the characterization of this quantity is not straightforward for carbon composites at high temperatures, due to pyrolysis reactions that occur in the material. We develop a methodology for determining the heat capacity and required heat of pyrolysis for carbon composites in these conditions. The methodology consists of three steps: organic elemental analysis to determine composition, differential scanning calorimetry experiments on the different components to determine apparent heat capacity, and computations to separate the apparent heat capacity into heat capacity and heat of pyrolysis. This methodology is applied to the Zuram® carbon/phenolic ablator from room temperature up to 1100 K. The results obtained were compared to separate analyzes of the different components of the material, assuming that heat capacity is an additive property. It was found that compressing the samples into disks provides improved resolution and repeatability for low density materials. This provided a determination of the heat capacity of the decomposing composite with a relative standard deviation < 10 % and of < 20 % for the heat of pyrolysis. The proposed methodology can directly be applied to other carbon composites such as carbon/epoxy systems.},

 abstract = {A comprehensive numerical study has been carried out to simulate the Mach 15 contoured nozzle flow in the VKI intermittent Longshot facility. The study has considered thermal nonequilibrium and real gas effects on the nozzle flow. The simulations were performed using a compressible flow Navier-Stokes solver, US3D, well suited for hypersonic flow simulations. Freestream rebuilding methods in the Longshot were briefly discussed to point out previously observed discrepancies between conventional methods and a more novel approach to freestream rebuilding which relied on measurements of the static pressure in the test section. An attempt to derive reservoir conditions from these experimental measurements for use in the simulations was made. The study showed agreement between the solver's predictions and experimental freestream when considering reservoir conditions derived from conventional methods which excluded the static pressure. This has been largely attributed to the static pressure probe's sensitivity to local conditions which could not be modeled in the solver. Flow over the static pressure and heat flux probes used to obtain the experimental measurements were also investigated numerically, considering the same effects. Overall, the study has shown real gas effects to be particularly important in high-density facilities, such as the Longshot, and revealed possible limitations of CFD comparisons in which the flow in the freestream is not well understood.},

 abstract = {This paper provides the analytical solution to a one-parameter Šesták–Berggren kinetic model for the thermoanalytical study of pyrolysis reactions involving multiple independent parallel reactions. Such multiple independent parallel reactions are widely used, for instance, in the modeling of the pyrolysis of thermal protection materials used in heatshields for spacecraft during the atmospheric entry phase. Solving inverse problems to infer parameters of the kinetic model through optimization techniques or Bayesian inference methods for uncertainty quantification may require a large number of evaluations of the response and its sensitivities (derivatives with respect to parameters). Moreover, in the case of kinetic equations, the Arrhenius parameters can exhibit strong dependence that can require further model evaluations for an accurate parameter calibration. The interest of this analytical solution is to reduce computation cost while having high accuracy to perform parameter calibration from experiments and sensitivity analysis. We propose to use exponential–integral functions to express the solution of the temperature integral, and we derive the analytical solution and its sensitivities for the parallel reaction model both for constant temperature (isothermal) and for constant heating rate conditions. The solution is validated on a six-equation model using parameters inferred in a previous work from the experimental data of the pyrolysis of a phenolic-impregnated carbon ablator material, and we compare the computational cost and accuracy of the implemented analytical solution with a numerical solution. Our results show that the use of such analytical solution with an accurate computation of the exponential–integral function significantly reduces the computational cost compared to the numerical solution.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we examine how to build coarse-grain transport models consistently from the kinetic to fluid regimes. The internal energy of the gas particles is described through a state-to-state approach. A kinetic equation allows us to study transport phenomena in phase space for a non-homogeneous gas mixture. Internal energy excitation is modeled using a binary collision operator, whereas gas chemical processes rely on a reactive collision operator. We obtain an asymptotic fluid model by means of a Chapman–Enskog perturbative solution to the Boltzmann equation in the Maxwellian reaction regime. The macroscopic conservation equations of species mass, mixture momentum, and energy as well as expressions of the transport properties are given. Reversibility relations for elementary processes are formulated in the coarse-grain model at the kinetic level and are enforced in the collision algorithm of the direct simulation Monte Carlo method used to solve the kinetic equation. Furthermore, respecting these reversibility relations is key to deriving a fluid model that is well-posed and compatible with the second law of thermodynamics. The consistency between the kinetic and fluid simulations is assessed for the simulation of a shock wave in a nitrogen gas using the uniform rovibrational collisional coarse-grain model. The kinetic and fluid simulations show consistency for the macroscopic properties and transport fluxes between both regimes.},

High-energy non-equilibrium flows of air and CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$–N2$$\hbox {N}_2$$ over a double-wedge geometry are studied numerically. The impact of freestream temperature on the non-equilibrium shock interaction patterns is investigated by simulating two different sets of freestream conditions. To this purpose, the SU2 solver has been extended to account for the conservation of chemical species as well as multiple energies and coupled to the Mutation++ library (Multicomponent Thermodynamic And Transport properties for IONized gases in C++) that provides all the necessary thermochemical properties of the mixture and chemical species. An analysis of the shock interference patterns is presented with respect to the existing taxonomy of interactions. A comparison between calorically perfect ideal gas and non-equilibrium simulations confirms that non-equilibrium effects greatly influence the shock interaction patterns. When thermochemical relaxation is considered, a type VI interaction is obtained for the CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$-dominated flow, for both freestream temperatures of 300 K and 1000 K; for air, a type V six-shock interaction and a type VI interaction are obtained, respectively. We conclude that the increase in freestream temperature has a large impact on the shock interaction pattern of the air flow, whereas for the CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$–N2$$\hbox {N}_2$$ flow the pattern does not change.},

The ability to model and predict the atypical behavior of the new cork-based materials is considered a critical research topic. Therefore, this work is motivated by the need to develop a numerical model able to respond to this demand, in preparation to the post-flight analysis of qarman. This study is focused on the main thermal response phenomena of the cork P50: pyrolysis and swelling. Pyrolysis was analyzed by means of the multi-physics Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code argo, developed at Cenaero. Based on a unified flow-material solver, the Volume Averaged Navier–Stokes (VANS) equations were numerically solved to describe the interaction between a multi-species high enthalpy flow and a reactive porous medium, by means of a high-order Discontinuous Galerkin Method (DGM). Specifically, an accurate method to compute the pyrolysis production rate was implemented. The modeling of swelling was the most ambitious task, requiring the development of a physical model accounting for this phenomenon, for the purpose of a future implementation within argo. A 1D model was proposed, mainly based on an a priori assumption on the swelling velocity and the resolution of a nonlinear advection equation, by means of a Finite Difference Method (FDM). Once developed, the model was successfully tested through a matlab code, showing that the approach is promising and thus opening the way to further developments.},

The QubeSat for Atmospheric Research and Measurement on Ablation mission (5.2 kg CubeSat launched in December 2019) gave a low-cost opportunity to develop a dedicated payload named “Imbedded Nano-platform-size Emission Spectrometer” (INES) to study the radiation of a reentry plasma in the presence of an ablative heatshield (Cork P50 from Amorim™). The payload is able to measure both radiation and thickness evolution of the TPS at the same location.

The polyatomic molecule has a relatively low characteristic vibrational temperature that causes vibrational degrees of freedom to be excited across a shock wave at hypersonic regimes. In this paper, the impact of accounting for the time associated to the relaxation of this process, as opposed to assuming instant thermal equilibrium, on the shock structures occurring in the flowfield over a double-wedge geometry is numerically studied. A Mach 9 flow over two different geometries is simulated with two different models, the two-temperature model of Park and the thermally perfect gas model. Simulations are carried out with the SU2 software that is coupled to the Mutation++ library, providing thermodynamic, chemical kinetic and transport properties of any mixture of gases for a given state of the flow. Anisotropic mesh adaption is used with the AMG library to accurately capture highly directional and high-gradient localized flow features. Results show that different ways of modelling the effect of vibrational relaxation have a major impact on the size of the compression corner separation bubble, leading to different shock wave systems in this region. As a consequence, the obtained shock interaction mechanisms differ as well. The shock patterns obtained for the thermally perfect gas model result in stronger impingement on the surface and higher aerodynamic loads of pressure and heat flux.},

 abstract = {This work deals with the inference of catalytic recombination parameters from plasma wind tunnel experiments for reusable thermal protection materials. One of the critical factors affecting the performance of such materials is the contribution to the heat flux of the exothermic recombination reactions at the vehicle surface. The main objective of this work is to develop a dedicated Bayesian framework that allows us to compare uncertain measurements with model predictions which depend on the catalytic parameter values. Our framework accounts for uncertainties involved in the model definition and incorporates all measured variables with their respective uncertainties. The physical model used for the estimation consists of a 1D boundary layer solver along the stagnation line. The chemical production term included in the surface mass balance depends on the catalytic recombination efficiency. As not all the different quantities needed to simulate a reacting boundary layer can be measured or known (such as the flow enthalpy at the inlet boundary), we propose an optimization procedure built on the construction of the likelihood function to determine their most likely values based on the available experimental data. This procedure avoids the need to introduce any a priori estimates on the nuisance quantities, namely, the boundary layer edge enthalpy, wall temperatures, static and dynamic pressures, which would entail the use of very wide priors. Furthermore, we substitute the optimal likelihood of the experimental measurements with a surrogate model to make the inference procedure both faster and more robust. We show that the resulting Bayesian formulation yields meaningful and accurate posterior probability distributions of the catalytic parameters with a reduction of more than 20% of the standard deviation with respect to previous works. We also study the implications of an extension of the experimental procedure on the improvement of the quality of the inference.},

 abstract = {Quantifying the thermal response of a heat shield is a key step in the design of a spacecraft to ensure its survivability during atmospheric entry. Recession and swelling of the thermal protection material have a drastic effect on both the heat transfer within the vehicle and aerothermodynamic transients. Postflight analysis of reentry can be achieved after recovery on Earth, but it is more difficult for entries on other bodies of the solar system. A dedicated instrumentation is necessary to understand the evolution of the thermal protection material thickness during flight. This paper investigates the current limitations of the available measurement techniques. A low-mass passive solution is proposed to measure with high accuracy the phenomena of recession and swelling. The QubeSat for Aerothermodynamic Research and Measurements on Ablation (QARMAN) CubeSat mission provides a flight opportunity to develop a dedicated payload to quantify the recession and swelling of an ablative heat shield made of P50 cork from AmorimTM. In addition, this payload allows us to study the radiation of a reentry plasma in the presence of ablation products through the same optical path. The performance of the measurement technique and the integration of the instrument are discussed for the QARMAN platform, demonstrating its applicability to a space mission.},

 abstract = {Thermal Protection Materials (TPM) such as carbon/phenolic composites are used to protect spacecraft structures from extreme conditions. This protection is, in part, achieved by the decomposition via pyrolysis of the phenolic resin. Finite rate chemistry models are however still unable to predict the chemical production rates and composition of the pyrolysis products accurately. This is mostly due to the scarcity of experimental data for model validation. In this work, the decomposition of a phenolic material representative of thermal protection material is studied in a unique micro-pyrolysis unit for the temperature range 300-800°C. This unit is equipped with highly sensitive detectors allowing us to identify and quantify products in a broad range of molecular weights up to 240 gmol−1. More than 50 different products of the pyrolysis of phenolic resin have been quantified with a mass balance closure greater than 80%. The major compound groups found are permanent gases, phenols as well as larger molecules such as diphenols and naphthalenes. In addition, the char yield obtained at the fast heating rates employed in our apparatus was found ∼ 5 % -points lower compared to traditional thermogravimetry.},

 abstract = {Testing thermal protection system materials in ground-based facilities, such as plasma wind tunnels, is a key step in the development of entry vehicles. The Local Heat Transfer Simulation methodology offers a systematic approach to identify, from a set of flight conditions such as altitude, velocity and vehicle size, the proper aerothermochemical testing environment to correctly reproduce the boundary layer near the stagnation point of the entry vehicle. Eventually, such a duplication ensures that the aerothermochemical flow characteristics of a hypersonic flight are correctly simulated during the ground testing of a material sample. The present work deals with the verification of the applicability of this methodology in the case of ablative-material testing, considering that the stagnation region could be significantly affected by the surface phenomena and the bulk mass injection. The performed theoretical analysis shows that the methodology can still be applied without any modifications to investigate the response of ablative thermal protection materials in a hypersonic environment. A numerical experiment is carried out which confirms these results, showing that the Local Heat Transfer Simulation methodology allows achieving in a ground-testing facility the complete duplication of the flight boundary-layer quantities near the stagnation region of the thermal protection material, regardless the specific gas-surface interaction mechanisms for the material under consideration.Graphic abstract},

In particular, carbon/epoxy composite materials have been found on Earth in several occasions. Accurate models to assess the demisability of such components require, in particular, detailed thermal degradation data for the epoxy resin. In this work, we analyze a resin used to manufacture such components, using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), organic elemental analysis, and pyrolysis coupled to comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography. The epoxy resin rapidly decomposed in a relatively narrow range of temperatures (300–400∘C) in more than 70 different volatile products. A one-step kinetic model is proposed for the pyrolysis of epoxy based on thermogravimetry observations. The information on the species and elemental composition can be used to develop more accurate material degradation models for predicting the demisability upon re-entry of space debris.},

 abstract = {The numerical simulation of hypersonic atmospheric entry flows is a challenging problem. Prediction of quantities of interest, such as surface heat flux and pressure, is strongly influenced by the mesh quality using conventional second-order spatial accuracy schemes while depending on boundary conditions, which may generally suffer from uncertainty. This paper illustrates one of the first systematic quantification of the numerical error and the uncertainty-induced variability for the simulation of hypersonic flows. Specifically, a mesh-convergence study using grid adaptation tools is coupled with surrogate-based approaches to Uncertainty Quantification. The illustrative example is the simulation of the EXPERT vehicle of the European Space Agency employing the US3D solver. First, we show the benefits in using mesh adaptation to simulate hypersonic flows under uncertainty. On the one hand, this practice reduces the numerical uncertainty associated with each prediction and, on the other hand, allows us to obtain a more reliable surrogate model for Uncertainty Quantification by preventing non-physical heat flux values. Secondly, we perform a sensitivity analysis to compare the numerical uncertainty associated with a given mesh with the UQ-induced variability for a specific quantity of interest. In the case considered, the impact of the numerical uncertainty turned out to be at least one order of magnitude less than the quantity of interest variability. This result indicates the possibility of using coarse and adapted meshes for future UQ studies.},

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of these conditions are crucial in the design process of such objects. A promising approach for the simulation of complex geometries is the use of immersed boundary methods (IBM) and adaptive mesh refinement techniques (AMR). These methods offer reliable and efficient mesh generation and adaptation with minimal user intervention. To that end, this paper presents the recent developments of two IBM-AMR solvers coupled with the same external thermochemistry library for the accurate modelling of such complex flows including GSI. Several verification and validation cases are presented, which demonstrate the performance of the solvers. Results are analyzed in comparison with a body-conforming solver that uses the same thermochemistry library to achieve a consistent assessment of the underlying numerical methods. A good agreement between all the solvers is indicated with certain discrepancies arising due to the differences in surface treatments.},

 abstract = {View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-3732.vid In this work, we seek to infer nitrogen ablation model parameters from different experimental measurements. First, the dependencies of the proposed stagnation line forward model are studied to establish the influence of the different parameters on the simulated counterparts of the available observations. Results show that recession rate and CN local density predictions in the boundary layer are mostly affected by the efficiency of the nitridation reactions at the gas-surface interface for the experimental conditions considered. In turn, it is expected that the available measured counterparts provide enough information to calibrate nitridation parameters. We then carry out different stochastic model calibrations and compare them on the basis of the experimental data considered. When used independently, measured recession rates and CN densities each give information about nitridation reactions. As they are both part of the same experiments, one model should be capable of explaining both observations at once. Checking for this consistency with the available data has the potential of improving the characterization of nitridation mechanisms and signaling issues with the model and/or the experiments. It is identified that the results obtained when using a particular measurement of local CN densities present inconsistencies when compared to the results obtained using the measured recession rate for the same experimental condition and under the same chosen physical model. The uncertainties of the experimental data are then included as free parameters in the inference framework with the results showing great departure of the calibrated standard deviation for the problematic condition from the rest of the dataset, suggesting that the measurement should be repeated in the future.},

 abstract = {Ions in Hall effect thrusters are often characterized by a low collisionality. In the presence of acceleration fields and azimuthal electric field waves, this results in strong deviations from thermodynamic equilibrium, introducing kinetic effects. This work investigates the application of the 14-moment maximum-entropy model to this problem. This method consists in a set of 14 partial differential equations (PDEs) for the density, momentum, pressure tensor components, heat flux vector, and fourth-order moment associated with the particle velocity distribution function. The model is applied to the study of collisionless ion dynamics in a Hall thruster-like configuration, and its accuracy is assessed against different models, including the Vlasov kinetic equation. Three test cases are considered: a purely axial acceleration problem, the problem of ion-wave trapping, and finally the evolution of ions in the axial-azimuthal plane. Most of this work considers ions only, and the coupling with electrons is removed by prescribing reasonable values of the electric field. This allows us to obtain a direct comparison among different ion models. However, the possibility to run self-consistent plasma simulations is also briefly discussed, considering quasi-neutral or multi-fluid models. The maximum-entropy system appears to be a robust and accurate option for the considered test cases. The accuracy is improved over the simpler pressureless gas model (cold ions) and the Euler equations for gas dynamics, while the computational cost shows to remain much lower than direct kinetic simulations.},

 abstract = {Dual-mode ramjet/scramjet engines promise extended flight speed range and are the commonly preferred air-breathing propulsion system from within the family of hypersonic aircraft concepts. One of the main challenges that should be hurdled in their design is modeling the fuel–air mixing process to provide optimal fuel distribution and yield the best engine performance. Injecting fuel into high-speed air stream along multiple parallel struts can augment the fuel penetration and improve mixing efficiency. Mixing intensity is increased with turbulence by the shock-expansion waves in post-strut regions. However, this enhancement in mixing can bring about detrimental effects on the aerodynamic performance by increasing losses on total pressure. Designing the optimal working configuration requires testing the interaction between many design variables. This can be a tedious and computationally costly task. Machine learning models thus appear well-suited for multi-objective optimization of design variables that can be elusive to designers. In particular, non-linear regression models can be built over the available sparse simulation data to predict unseen mixing conditions. In the present work, we carry out a detailed investigation of the effect of multi-strut configuration parameters on three objective functions: mixing efficiency, mixing length, and the total pressure recovery (TPR) factor. These objective functions are linked with the most relevant physical phenomena in the supersonic fuel–air mixing flow field. We first generate a CFD database by solving compressible, non-reactive, Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) filtered flow equations in a 2D scramjet engine domain with three varying design variables: struts location, strut wedge angle and strut V-settlement angle. We then apply various regression models – artificial neural network (ANN), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and kernel regression – to this database and formulate a surrogate model relevant for fuel injection that can be utilized in reduced-order modeling studies that estimate the hypersonic engine performance. We find that regression is generally more difficult in the vicinity of fuel struts (due to turbulence/shock effects) and easier further downstream from the struts, but ANN performs generally better than other regression models. Thus, our reduced-order tool incorporates a mixing efficiency model predicted by the ANN. It computes the thrust of a hypersonic engine with less than 10% error. We also present a detailed discussion of the physical insights gained from our CFD database; we link this discussion with the earlier findings from the machine learning tools. In our sensitivity study, we find the strut wedge angle to be the most influencing parameter on the mixing properties and aerodynamic losses.},

In this work, we evaluate the capabilities of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method (SPH) of characterizing liquid sloshing motion. SPH simulations are performed using the open-source code DualSPHysics, which employs a weakly compressible assumption to simulate incompressible flows. We verify the SPH scheme by showing that the calculated boundary layer matches the analytical solution of the Stokes problem. The methodology is then validated against an open-access experimental database involving sloshing experiments on partially-filled cylindrical tanks subject to horizontal excitations. We present a study of two regimes: (a) a forced, periodic regime and (b) a transient regime where we compare the full liquid interface elevation, the corresponding frequency content and the full liquid interface damping maps. The simulations are able to capture the relevant flow physics with a good level of accuracy. In particular, the simulations fairly accurately reproduced the elevation of the full free surface, predicting a 3D crescent shape of the rising wavefronts, as well as damping rates under free sloshing. Analysis of the frequency range further showed good agreement of the dominant frequencies between the experimental, simulated and analytical values given by the linearized sloshing theory.},

 abstract = {Severe epistemic uncertainties not only can affect the prescription of parameters within a given model but also the choice of models we make to interpret and infer from experimental data. In this work, we incorporate experimental, parametric and model-form uncertainties in the calibration of a carbon nitridation model. The model-form uncertainties considered stem from the different modeling choices that are taken as valid representations of a set of plasma wind tunnel experiments. To this end, we define a Bayesian Model Averaging strategy where the marginal posteriors of the nitridation reaction efficiencies are weighted by the marginalized likelihoods of the experimental data for each proposed model. First, Bayes factors are computed to possibly discard invalid models. The baseline model, a thermal equilibrium stagnation line flow with nitridation as only surface reaction, performs as well as all the alternative models proposed, which range from adding surface recombination reactions to considering thermal non-equilibrium in the gas and gas-surface interface. The presence of nitrogen recombination reactions is shown to broaden the support of the nitridation marginal posteriors considerably, allowing it to take on larger values. Lastly, a Bayesian model averaged Arrhenius law for the nitridation efficiencies is computed for a range of surface temperatures.},

@article{pub.1160081296,
 abstract = {The entry phase constitutes a design driver for aerospace systems that include such a critical step. This phase is characterized by hypersonic flows encompassing multiscale phenomena that require advanced modeling capabilities. However, because high-fidelity simulations are often computationally prohibitive, simplified models are needed in multidisciplinary analyses requiring fast predictions. This work proposes data-driven surrogate models to predict the flow and mixture properties along the stagnation streamline of hypersonic flows past spherical objects. Surrogate models are designed to predict the velocity, pressure, temperature, density, and air composition as functions of the object’s radius, velocity, reentry altitude, and surface temperature. These models are trained with data produced by numerical simulation of the quasi-one-dimensional Navier–Stokes formulation and a selected Earth atmospheric model. Physics-constrained parametric functions are constructed for each flow variable of interest, and artificial neural networks are used to map the model parameters to the model’s inputs. Surrogate models were also developed to predict surface quantities of interest for the case of nonreacting or ablative carbon-based surfaces, providing alternatives to semiempirical correlations. A validation study is presented for all the developed models, and their predictive capabilities are showcased along selected reentry trajectories of space debris from low Earth orbits.},

 abstract = {We propose a methodology used to estimate the performance of hypersonic engines by coupling some machine learning methods with a generated CFD database and one-dimensional expansion equations. The present work also investigates the effects of fuel struts geometrical parameters on the supersonic combustion which takes place in a dual-mode ramjet/scramjet engine operating at stratospheric flight conditions with a cruise speed of Mach 8. We solved 2D compressible RANS flow equations coupled with the β-pdf method using Ansys Fluent commercial code, and built a CFD database with varying three design parameters which are strut V-settlement angle, strut location, and wedge angle. The numerical code was verified/validated using the data obtained in the DLR scramjet combustor. Three main objective functions in the combustor (combustion efficiency along 14 stations having 10 cm interval between each other, averaged flow variables at exit of combustor, and total pressure recovery factor in the combustor) were selected to evaluate the struts configuration parameters effects on supersonic combustion flow physics and engine performance. These objective functions, i.e. dependent variables were regressed with independent design parameters by three machine learning techniques which are Kernel regression, Gaussian process regression, and Artificial neural network. The machine learning models of the flow variables at the combustor throat provided initial conditions for a given fuel strut configuration to the expansion solutions for the nozzle component in order to calculate the engine performance. The Artificial neural network was found the most successful technique in overall regression of the objective functions. We also discovered that the most significant design variable is the strut wedge angle for all investigated phenomena in the supersonic reactive flow field.},

@article{pub.1161696837,
 abstract = {In this paper, we develop a high-order method for the steady two-phase compressible Navier–Stokes equations closed by generic equations of state, adapted to gas–liquid flows. Our framework relies on the extended discontinuous Galerkin method that is tailored here to a general viscous compressible two-phase configuration. While the imposition of interface jumps conditions is commonly recognized as one of the main difficulties to overcome in the context of geometrically unfitted methods, the setting considered in this work makes this aspect even more challenging. To enforce the non-linear coupling conditions at the interface in a sharp manner, we devise a novel strategy combining multiphase Riemann solvers to handle the convective fluxes across the interface and a weighted stabilized Nitsche’s method for the viscous jumps. The weak enforcement of the jumps conditions along with implicit steady-state iterations and cell-agglomeration procedure make the approach robust to treat arbitrary large contrast phase interface problems governed by stiff models, irrespective of the interface location on the mesh. The study is here restricted to static interfaces. Based on the method of manufactured solution, reference solutions are designed. This allows to conduct a detailed numerical study investigating the influence of several numerical parameters. It is shown that to reach optimal error convergence, the use of pressure-velocity-temperature variables set, appropriate all-speed bulk Riemann solver and Symmetric Interior Penalty method combined with tensorial penalty is necessary.},

@article{pub.1162929461,
 abstract = {The 10 and 14-moment maximum-entropy methods are applied to the study of high-Mach-number non-reacting crossflows past a flat plate at large degrees of rarefaction. The moment solutions are compared to particle-based kinetic solutions, showing a varying degree of accuracy. At a Knudsen number of 0.1, the 10-moment method is able to reproduce the shock layer, while it fails to predict the low-density wake region, due to the lack of a heat flux. Conversely, the 14-moment method results in accurate predictions of both regions. At a Knudsen number of 1, the 10-moment method produces unphysical results in both the shock layer and in the wake. The 14-moment method also shows a reduced accuracy, but manages to predict a reasonable shock region, free of unphysical sub-shocks and is in qualitative agreement with the kinetic solution. Accuracy is partially lost in the wake, where the 14-moment method predicts a thin unphysical high-density layer, concentrated on the centerline. An analysis of the velocity distribution functions (VDF) indicates strongly non-Maxwellian shapes and the presence of distinct particle populations, in the wake, crossing each other at the centerline. The particle-based and the 14-moment method VDFs are in qualitative agreement.},

 abstract = {Immersed boundary (IB) methods with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) techniques
are assessed for atmospheric entry applications, including effects of chemical
nonequilibrium (CNE) and gas-surface interactions (GSI). The performance of a
conservative cut-cell and two non-conservative ghost-cell IB methods is
assessed in comparison with analytical solutions, data from literature, and
results obtained with a reference solver that operates on body-fitted grids.
All solvers use the same external thermochemistry library so that all observed
differences can be attributed to the underlying numerical methods. Results from
eight benchmark cases are reported. Four cases are selected to verify the
implementation of chemistry, transport properties, catalytic boundary
conditions, and shock capturing. Four validation cases consider blunt
geometries with adiabatic/isothermal and inert/catalytic/ablative boundary
conditions. Overall, the results obtained with the IB solvers are in very good
agreement with the reference data. Discrepancies arise with ghost-cell methods
for cases with large temperature or concentration gradients at the wall and are
attributed to mass conservation errors. Only a strictly conservative cut-cell
IB method is on par with body-fitted grid methods.},

@article{pub.1168092003,
 abstract = {Ablative thermal protection systems have experienced renewed interest in the past decade owing to the retirement of NASA's Space Shuttle fleet and the US presidential mandate to develop technologies that enable humans to explore space beyond low Earth orbit. Blunt body architecture for spacecraft and the use of ablators for thermal protection systems returned as the primary choice in mission planning. This review addresses current progress in modernizing predictive tools for ablative material response. Current theory development leverages progress made in the theory of flows in porous media. This development, combined with progress in experimental techniques and high-end computing, is enabling the development of 3D macroscale models with realistic closure coefficients derived from direct numerical simulations of 3D microscale geometries of actual materials. While flight data quantifying ablative material response remain sparse, the next decade will be one of exploration in which heatshield instrumented spacecraft will provide crucial flight data for refining and validating closure models.},

 abstract = {We present our open-source code SMARTA. It can be used to compute internal and external collisionless gas flows when surface reflections are fully diffuse and gas sources are described by drifting Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution functions. The code is based on the view-factor method, analogous to the radiosity method commonly used in the fields of radiative heat transfer and computer graphics. In SMARTA, surfaces, including flow inlets and outlets, are represented using triangle meshes. In this work, we first show the derivation of the method. Then, we provide some details of the implementation and the algorithms used in the code to increase its efficiency and accuracy. Finally, we present some simple test cases that are used to verify the code and show its capabilities. These include a numerical experiment to analyze the convergence of the solution with the mesh size, as well as more practical applications to external and internal flows. Specifically, the computation of the aerodynamic pressure on a satellite in free molecular conditions, and the evaluation of the transmissivity of an intake for Air-Breathing Electric Propulsion. Strengths and weaknesses of the code, in relation to particle methods and panel methods, will be highlighted. We show that, in the cases where the underlying assumptions of the method are valid, SMARTA represents a simple to set-up alternative that can complement or even substitute the use of a Monte Carlo method. The main advantages are represented by the absence of stochastic noise in the results, and the possibility to reuse the view-factors for different computations.},
