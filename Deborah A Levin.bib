@article{pub.1001812815,
 abstract = {Since its discovery, the Enceladus plume has been subjected to intense study due to the major effects that it has on the Saturnian system and the window that it provides into the interior of Enceladus. However, several questions remain and we attempt to answer some of them in this work. In particular, we aim to constrain the H2O production rate from the plume, evaluate the relative importance of the jets and the distributed sources along the Tiger Stripes, and make inferences about the source of the plume by accurately modeling the plume and constraining the model using the Cassini INMS and UVIS data. This is an extension of a previous work (Yeoh, S.K., et al. [2015] Icarus, 253, 205–222) in which we only modeled the collisional part of the Enceladus plume and studied its important physical processes. In this work, we propagate the plume farther into space where the flow has become free-molecular and the Cassini INMS and UVIS data were sampled. Then, we fit this part of the plume to the INMS H2O density distributions sampled along the E3, E5 and E7 trajectories and also compare some of the fit results with the UVIS measurements of the plume optical depth collected during the solar occultation observation on 18 May 2010. We consider several vent conditions and source configurations for the plume. By constraining our model using the INMS and UVIS data, we estimate H2O production rates of several hundred kgs-1: 400–500kg/s during the E3 and E7 flybys and ∼900kg/s during the E5 flyby. These values agree with other estimates and are consistent with the observed temporal variability of the plume over the orbital period of Enceladus (Hedman, M.M., et al. [2013] Nature, 500, 182–184). In addition, we determine that one of the Tiger Stripes, Cairo, exhibits a local temporal variability consistent with the observed overall temporal variability of the plume. We also find that the distributed sources along the Tiger Stripes are likely dominant while the jets provide a lesser contribution. Moreover, our best-fit solutions for the plume are sensitive to the vent conditions chosen. The spreading angle of the jet produced is the main difference among the vent conditions and thus it appears to be an important parameter in fitting to these INMS data sets. In general, we find that narrow jets produce better fits, suggesting high Mach numbers (> 5) at the vents. This is supported by certain narrow features believed to be jets in both the INMS and UVIS data sets. This tends to rule out sublimation from the surface but points to a deep underground source for the plume. However, the underground source can be either sublimation from an icy reservoir or evaporation from a liquid reservoir. A high Mach number at the vent also suggests subsurface channels with large variations in width and not fairly straight channels so that the gas can undergo sufficient expansion. Additionally, the broad spreading angles inferred for the µm-sized grains (Ingersoll, A.P. and Ewald, S.P. [2011] Icarus, 216, 492–506; Postberg, F., et al. [2011] Nature, 474, 620–622) cannot be due to spreading by the gas above the surface alone. Some other mechanism(s) must also be responsible, perhaps occurring below the surface, which further points to an underground source for the plume.},

@article{pub.1006814255,
 abstract = {The simulation of the UV spectra of moderate Mach number flows is the strongest test possible of the complex thermochemical models in hypersonic flows. To take advantage of low-density ground-based measurements, however, one needs to be able to model unsteady flows using kinetic particle approaches. The direct simulation Monte Carlo approach is used in this paper to model the thermal relaxation in nonreacting nitrogen shocks corresponding to the data and the higher Mach number air shocks and radiation of previous research. In the first case, it is found that better agreement with experimental data can be achieved when assuming a constant rotational collision number instead of a temperature-dependent one. For the second data set, the nonequilibrium NO UV radiation from unsteady reflected air shocks are modeled and compared with experimental data. The Larsen–Borgnakke and total collision energy models are used to simulate the internal energy relaxation and chemistry of five chemical species (N2, O2, N, O, and NO), respectively. Unlike steady shock layer flows, the long period of equilibration behind the shock wave occurs and potential factors that prevent complete thermochemical equilibrium are explored. The main goal of this paper, however, is to compare the spectrally averaged peak shock radiation with data. Because there are insufficient collisions to assume a Boltzmann distribution of the NO electronic states, a set of excitation/deexcitation mechanisms are proposed and the quasi-steady-state assumption is used in calculating the neutral-impact excitation of NO and the associated radiation. The calculated spectrally averaged peak radiations in the shock are in good agreement with the experimental data of Gorelov for shock speeds below 7  km/s, but are lower at higher shock speeds.},

 abstract = {A k-distribution model is presented for gas mixtures in thermodynamic nonequilibrium, containing strongly radiating atomic species N and O together with molecular species of N2, N2+, NO and O2. In the VUV range of the spectrum there is strong absorption of atomic radiation by bands of N2. For this spectral range, a multi-scale model is presented, where RTEs are solved separately for each emitting species and overlap with other species is treated in an approximate way. Methodology for splitting the gas mixture into scales and evaluation of the overlap parameter between different scales is presented. The accuracy of the new model is demonstrated by solving the radiative transfer equation along the stagnation line flow field of the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV).},

@article{pub.1012172441,
 abstract = {There is significant scientific interest in simulating the unique atmospheric conditions on the Jovian moon Io that range from cold surface temperatures to hyperthermal interactions which possibly supply the Jovian plasma torus. The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is well suited to model the rarefied, predominantly SO2, Ionian atmosphere. High speed collisions between SO2 and the hypervelocity O atoms and ions that compose the plasma torus are a significant mechanism in determining the composition of the atmosphere; therefore, high-fidelity modeling of their interactions is crucial to the accuracy of such simulations. Typically, the Total Collision Energy (TCE) model is used to determine molecular dissociation probabilities and the Variable Hard Sphere (VHS) model is used to determine collision cross sections. However, the parameters for each of these baseline models are based on low-temperature experimental data and thus have unknown reliability for the hyperthermal conditions in the Ionian atmosphere. Recently, Molecular Dynamics/Quasi-Classical Trajectory (MD/QCT) studies have been conducted to generate accurate collision and chemistry models for the SO2–O collision pair in order to replace the baseline models. However, the influence of MD/QCT models on Ionian simulations compared to the previously used models is not well understood. In this work, 1D simulations are conducted using both the MD/QCT-based and baseline models in order to determine the effect of MD/QCT models on Ionian simulations. It is found that atmospheric structure predictions are highly sensitive to the chemistry and collision models. Specifically, the MD/QCT model predicts approximately half the SO2 atmospheric dissociation due to O and O+ bombardment compared to TCE models, and also predicts a temperature rise due to plasma heating further from the Ionian surface than the existing baseline methodologies. These findings indicate that the accurate MD/QCT chemistry and collision models provide a significant improvement over the baseline models for DSMC simulations of the Ionian atmosphere.},

 abstract = {Modeling results of volcanic plumes on Jupiter’s moon Io are presented. Two types of low density axisymmetric SO2 plume flows are modeled using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. Thermal radiation from all three vibrational bands and overall rotational lines of SO2 molecules is modeled. A high resolution computation of the flow in the vicinity of the vent was obtained by multidomain sequential calculation to improve the modeling of the radiation signature. The radiation features are examined both by calculating infrared emission spectra along different lines-of-sight through the plume and with the DSMC modeled emission images of the whole flow field. It is found that most of the radiation originates in the vicinity of the vent, and non-LTE (non-local-thermodynamic equilibrium) cooling by SO2 rotation lines exceeds cooling in the v2 vibrational band at high altitude.In addition to the general shape of the plumes, the calculated average SO2 column density (∼1016 cm−2) over a Pele-type plume and the related frost-deposition ring structure (at R ∼ 500 km from the vent) are in agreement with observations. These comparisons partially validate the modeling. It is suggested that an observation with spatial resolution of less than 30 km is needed to measure the large spatial variation of SO2 near a Pele-type plume center. It is also found that an influx of 1.1 × 1029 SO2 s−1 (or 1.1 × 104 kg s−1) is sufficient to reproduce the observed SO2 column density at Pele. The simulation results also show some interesting features such as a multiple bounce shock structure around Prometheus-type plumes and the frost depletion by plume-induced erosion on the sunlit side of Io. The model predicts the existence of a canopy shock, a ballistic region inside the Pele-type plume, and the negligible effect of surface heating by plume emission.},

 abstract = {Homogeneous water condensation and ice formation in supersonic expansions to vacuum for stagnation pressures from 12 to 1000 mbar are studied using the particle-based Ellipsoidal-Statistical Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (ES-BGK) method. We find that when condensation starts to occur, at a stagnation pressure of 96 mbar, the increase in the degree of condensation causes an increase in the rotational temperature due to the latent heat of vaporization. The simulated rotational temperature profiles along the plume expansion agree well with measurements confirming the kinetic homogeneous condensation models and the method of simulation. Comparisons of the simulated gas and cluster number densities, cluster size for different stagnation pressures along the plume centerline were made and it is found that the cluster size increase linearly with respect to stagnation pressure, consistent with classical nucleation theory. The sensitivity of our results to cluster nucleation model and latent heat values based on bulk water, specific cluster size, or bulk ice are examined. In particular, the ES-BGK simulations are found to be too coarse-grained to provide information on the phase or structure of the clusters formed. For this reason, molecular dynamics simulations of water condensation in a one-dimensional free expansion to simulate the conditions in the core of a plume are performed. We find that the internal structure of the clusters formed depends on the stagnation temperature. A larger cluster of average size 21 was tracked down the expansion, and a calculation of its average internal temperature as well as a comparison of its radial distribution functions (RDFs) with values measured for solid amorphous ice clusters lead us to conclude that this cluster is in a solid-like rather than liquid form. In another molecular-dynamics simulation at a much lower stagnation temperature, a larger cluster of size 324 and internal temperature 200 K was extracted from an expansion plume and equilibrated to determine its RDF and self-diffusion coefficient. The value of the latter shows that this cluster is formed in a supercooled liquid state rather than in an amorphous solid state. },

 abstract = {The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method typically used for simulating hypersonic Earth re-entry flows requires accurate total collision cross sections and reaction probabilities. However, total cross sections are often determined from extrapolations of relatively low-temperature viscosity data, so their reliability is unknown for the high temperatures observed in hypersonic flows. Existing DSMC reaction models accurately reproduce experimental equilibrium reaction rates, but the applicability of these rates to the strong thermal nonequilibrium observed in hypersonic shocks is unknown. For hypersonic flows, these modeling issues are particularly relevant for nitrogen, the dominant species of air. To rectify this deficiency, the Molecular Dynamics/Quasi-Classical Trajectories (MD/QCT) method is used to accurately compute collision and reaction cross sections for the N2(Σg+1)-N2(Σg+1) collision pair for conditions expected in hypersonic shocks using a new potential energy surface developed using a ReaxFF fit to recent advanced ab initio calculations. The MD/QCT-computed reaction probabilities were found to exhibit better physical behavior and predict less dissociation than the baseline total collision energy reaction model for strong nonequilibrium conditions expected in a shock. The MD/QCT reaction model compared well with computed equilibrium reaction rates and shock-tube data. In addition, the MD/QCT-computed total cross sections were found to agree well with established variable hard sphere total cross sections. },

Molecular Dynamics/Quasi-Classical Trajectory (MD/QCT) studies are conducted to generate post-collision SO2 and post-dissociation SO internal energy distributions as a function of initial SO2 internal energy and relative collision velocity, which are found to be an improvement over the baseline Larsen–Borgnakke (LB) method that often predicts unphysical internal energies above the dissociation energy for non-reacting collisions and under-predicts post-dissociation SO internal energy. An approach for sampling from the MD/QCT-based internal energy distributions in DSMC is developed and DSMC simulations are then conducted for a time-dependent thermal nonequilibrium heat bath using both the MD/QCT-based distributions and the LB model. When only SO2–O collisions are considered, noticeable differences are observed for post-collisional SO2 and SO internal temperatures.},

 abstract = {Conflicting observations regarding the dominance of either sublimation or volcanism as the source of the atmosphere on Io and disparate reports on the extent of its spatial distribution and the absolute column abundance invite the development of detailed computational models capable of improving our understanding of Io’s unique atmospheric structure and origin. Improving upon previous models, Walker et al. (Walker, A.C., Gratiy, S.L., Levin, D.A., Goldstein, D.B., Varghese, P.L., Trafton, L.M., Moore, C.H., Stewart, B. [2009]. Icarus) developed a fully 3-D global rarefied gas dynamics model of Io’s atmosphere including both sublimation and volcanic sources of SO2 gas. The fidelity of the model is tested by simulating remote observations at selected wavelength bands and comparing them to the corresponding astronomical observations of Io’s atmosphere. The simulations are performed with a new 3-D spherical-shell radiative transfer code utilizing a backward Monte Carlo method. We present: (1) simulations of the mid-infrared disk-integrated spectra of Io’s sunlit hemisphere at 19μm, obtained with TEXES during 2001–2004; (2) simulations of disk-resolved images at Lyman-α obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) during 1997–2001; and (3) disk-integrated simulations of emission line profiles in the millimeter wavelength range obtained with the IRAM-30m telescope in October–November 1999. We found that the atmospheric model generally reproduces the longitudinal variation in band depth from the mid-infrared data; however, the best match is obtained when our simulation results are shifted ∼30° toward lower orbital longitudes. The simulations of Lyman-α images do not reproduce the mid-to-high latitude bright patches seen in the observations, suggesting that the model atmosphere sustains columns that are too high at those latitudes. The simulations of emission line profiles in the millimeter spectral region support the hypothesis that the atmospheric dynamics favorably explains the observed line widths, which are too wide to be formed by thermal Doppler broadening alone.},

 abstract = {Io’s sublimation-driven atmosphere is modeled using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. These rarefied gas dynamics simulations improve upon earlier models by using a three-dimensional domain encompassing the entire planet computed in parallel. The effects of plasma heating, planetary rotation, inhomogeneous surface frost, molecular residence time of SO2 on the exposed (non-volatile) rocky surface, and surface temperature distribution are investigated. Circumplanetary flow is predicted to develop from the warm dayside toward the cooler nightside. Io’s rotation leads to a highly asymmetric frost surface temperature distribution (due to the frost’s high thermal inertia) which results in circumplanetary flow that is not axi-symmetric about the subsolar point. The non-equilibrium thermal structure of the atmosphere, specifically vibrational and rotational temperatures, is also examined. Plasma heating is found to significantly inflate the atmosphere on both the dayside and nightside. The plasma energy flux causes high temperatures at high altitudes but plasma energy depletion through the dense gas column above the warmest frost permits gas temperatures cooler than the surface at low altitudes. A frost map (Douté, S., Schmitt, B., Lopes-Gautier, R., Carlson, R., Soderblom, L., Shirley, J., and the Galileo NIMS Team [2001]. Icarus 149, 107–132) is used to control the sublimated flux of SO2 which can result in inhomogeneous column densities that vary by nearly a factor of four for the same surface temperature. A short residence time for SO2 molecules on the “rock” component is found to smooth lateral atmospheric inhomogeneities caused by variations in the surface frost distribution, creating an atmosphere that looks nearly identical to one with uniform frost coverage. A longer residence time is found to agree better with mid-infrared observations (Spencer, J.R., Lellouch, E., Richter, M.J., López-Valverde, M.A., Jessup, K.L, Greathouse, T.K., Flaud, J. [2005]. Icarus 176, 283–304) and reproduce the observed anti-jovian/sub-jovian column density asymmetry. The computed peak dayside column density for Io assuming a surface frost temperature of 115K agrees with those suggested by Lyman-α observations (Feaga, L.M., McGrath, M., Feldman, P.D. [2009]. Icarus 201, 570–584). On the other hand, the peak dayside column density at 120K is a factor of five larger and is higher than the upper range of observations (Jessup, K.L., Spencer, J.R., Ballester, G.E., Howell, R.R., Roesler, F., Vigel, M., Yelle, R. [2004]. Icarus 169, 197–215; Spencer et al., 2005).},

 abstract = {A spectroscopic/collisional-radiative model is presented that permits the calculation of OH (A2Σ+−X2Π) spectra in the ultraviolet for a wide range of gas dynamics conditions, including those observed in hypersonic flows. This requires a rotational–vibrational–electronic excitation model sufficiently general to account for the diversity of collision rates that encompasses conditions ranging from equilibrium to collisionless regimes. To this end, the proposed excitation model considers several state-specific processes, including quenching, predissociation, radiation, and vibrational–rotational exchange. Although the structure of the OH (A→X) spectra is complex, accurate line positions and transition probabilities are available and have been used. This paper discusses the full excitation and spectral model and provides examples that demonstrate its generality. Detailed comparisons are presented with experimental spectra measured under very different conditions. The first spectrum was measured at atmospheric pressure in a plasma generated by a 50 kW radio-frequency plasma torch. The second spectrum was measured under rarefied conditions in the bow shock of a reentering rocket.},

In all cases, direct comparison of the experimental data and the predictions from DSMC showed excellent agreement, with only minor deviations which, in most cases, can be ascribed to either the inherent uncertainty in the MTV or small uncertainties in the measured wall pressures.},

@article{pub.1033240011,
 abstract = {The grid-free octree direct simulation Monte–Carlo algorithm has been explored to simulate flows through and heat transfer to highly irregular geometries for finite Knudsen numbers. The approach was extended to accurately compute the volume of irregular octree clusters as well as a line-of-sight test before performing collisions in octree clusters that are intersected by a solid boundary. The modified grid-free octree direct simulation Monte–Carlo algorithm was tested for the classic Fourier and micro-Poiseuille flows. A single sphere as well as an aggregate of spheres were modeled in a 500 K heat bath and supersonic flow. For the heat bath case, it was observed that a two-level Cartesian grid direct simulation Monte–Carlo code was able to achieve the same heat flux to a single sphere as the octree approach if 10 times more computational particles were used. Furthermore, even with increased computational load, the two-level Cartesian approach encountered a difference of 15% from the octree calculation for heat flux for interior spheres due to shielding by outer spheres. It was found that, for supersonic flows surrounding a single sphere and an aggregate, the octree approach was able to resolve the detached bow shock as well as the wake region, and in the aggregate case, the spatial resolution was sufficient to capture distinct multiple shocks in terms of temperature jump and pressure contours. Computational efficiency in terms of central processing unit–graphical processing unit computing is also discussed.},

 abstract = {The interaction between nitrogen vibrational-translational relaxation with different chemistry models in a hypersonic shock is studied. The vibrational-translational transition models considered include the Larsen–Borgnakke, Schwartz-Slawsky-Herzfeld, and forced harmonic oscillator models; and the nitrogen monoxide formation reaction was studied using the total collision energy chemistry model and reaction cross sections obtained from quasi-classical trajectory simulations. Using direct simulation Monte Carlo solutions that incorporate these models, improved nitrogen monoxide spectral radiation modeling was performed by employing quenching rates from recent experiments. Comparisons of electronic state populations and the corresponding radiative spectra for the different vibrational-translational and chemistry models are presented, and it is shown that the vibronic spectral structure of the nitrogen monoxide radiation could provide a way to test the fidelity of the internal energy transfer and chemistry models.},

 abstract = {Ion thruster plumes are simulated under a framework that was recently developed to take advantage of the large scalability of unstructured grids using adaptive mesh refinement. Momentum and charge-exchange collisions occurring between neutral and ion species, as well as the induced electric field due to ions, have been performed using multiple adaptive mesh refinement meshes to study the backflow of an ion thruster to a spacecraft surface. Furthermore, the ions and neutral species are directly coupled, which is found to have a 15% effect on the neutral species velocity profiles. The backflow for ions is found to occur when charge-exchange and momentum-exchange collisions are present, and then it is strongly enhanced when the induced electric field is considered. The ion energy distributions in the backflow region are obtained, and it is found that the inclusion of the electric field modeling is the most important factor in determining its shape. The plume backflow structure is also examined for a triple-thruster three-dimensional geometry case, and it is found that the ion velocity in the backflow region appears to be roughly independent of the number of thrusters. Finally, the influence of solar cell panel voltage on backflow fluxes is evaluated using a combined commercial software-generated potential with the induced potential, and the influence of gas–surface interactions is studied.},

 abstract = {One of the major mechanisms of deactivating spores is to expose them to elevated temperatures. Experiments carried out in an exposure tube to study the effects on spores in a high temperature gas environment provide evidence of spore deactivation, although the deactivation mechanism is not clear. Numerical studies have been performed to complement the experimental work and to study the effects of various parameters, such as gas temperature, exposure time, and internal pressure on spore survivability. The laminar and turbulent flow fields of a sudden expansion inside the thermal exposure system were simulated by computational fluid dynamics. A thermo-structural model with wall porosity was developed to take into account the dynamic response of the spore wall structure to the internal pressure exerted by the heated vapor on the spore wall. Finally, the results of the transient heat transfer and the thermo-structural models are discussed in the context of the uncertainties in biological system parameters and spore survivability.},

@article{pub.1040554770,
 abstract = {A collision-limiter method, designated as equilibrium direct simulation Monte Carlo (eDSMC), is proposed to extend the DSMC technique to high pressure flows. The method is similar to collision-limiter schemes considered in the past with the important distinction that for inviscid flows, equilibrium is enforced in the entire flow by providing a sufficient number of collisions, based on pre-simulation testing. To test the method with standard DSMC and Navier–Stokes (NS) methods, axi-symmetric nozzle and embedded-channel flows are simulated and compared with experimental temperature data and pre-existing calculations, respectively. The method is shown to agree with third-order Eulerian nozzle flows and first-order channel flows. Chapman–Enskog theory is utilized to predict the range of initial conditions where eDSMC is potentially useful for modeling flows that contain viscous boundary layer regions. Comparison with supersonic nozzle data suggests that the eDSMC method is not adequate for capturing the large variation in flow length scales occurring in supersonic expansions into a vacuum. However, when eDSMC is used in combination with the baseline-DSMC method a near-exact solution is obtained with a considerable computational savings compared to the exact DSMC solution. Viscous flow channel calculations are found to agree well with an exact Navier–Stokes (NS) calculation for a small Knudsen number case as predicted by Chapman–Enskog theory.},

 abstract = {In the present work, a new particle–particle hybrid method that combines the statistical ellipsoidal-statistical Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook and direct simulation Monte Carlo methods is developed. The switching criterion between the two methods is based on the deviation of the cumulative velocity distribution function from Maxwellian as measured by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistical test. Unlike other hybrid approaches that use switching criteria based on macroscopic properties, the selection of a particular particle method in a cell is determined by the local Kolmogorov–Smirnov parameter value with respect to a preset global switching criterion. A numerically efficient technique to compute the Kolmogorov–Smirnov parameter was developed to enable the efficient calculation of the degree of nonequilibrium. Two well-known fluid-flow problems, expanding argon flow through a nozzle and hypersonic flow over a blunt body, were studied. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov parameter is shown to demarcate the regions of nonequilibrium from the near-equilibrium regions, and the solutions obtained by the hybrid method are shown to agree well with the benchmark direct simulation Monte Carlo solutions for both case studies. The newly developed hybrid method is also shown to be numerically more efficient than either of the component methods.},

 abstract = {Validation of global numerical models of planetary atmospheres requires simulating images and spectra from the IR to UV spectral regions in order to compare them with remote observations. This paper describes Rassvet, a 3-D spherical-shell backward Monte Carlo radiative transfer model developed for such simulations. It utilizes a new methodology for calculating atmospheric brightness in scattered sunlight by introducing the concept of an “effective emission source”. This allows for the accumulation of the scattered contribution along the entire path of a ray and the calculation of the atmospheric radiation when both scattered sunlight and thermal emission contribute to the remote measurement – which was not possible in previous models. A “polychromatic” algorithm is extended for applications with the backward Monte Carlo method and implemented in the model. It allows for the calculation of radiative intensity for several wavelengths simultaneously, resulting in improved efficiency. The capabilities of the model are demonstrated by simulating remote measurements from the atmosphere of Io.},

 abstract = {The total desolvation rate of sample droplets in an argon inductively coupled plasma (Ar ICP) is investigated through the development of a two-phase continuum flow computer model. The desolvation model is supplemented by equations used to determine the trajectories of particles through the plasma. The model is used to calculate the behavior of aerosol droplets from a direct injection high efficiency nebulizer (DIHEN), a micronebulizer used to inject microliter quantities of samples that are toxic, expensive, or of limited volume. We use the combination of desolvation and transport models to present the first predicted spatial distribution of droplet concentrations and evaporation rates in an ICP flow. These data are compared with the behavior of a DIHEN spray in an environment with no net argon gas flow to determine the importance of gas flow rates to overall droplet concentration profiles in the ICP. In addition, two separate techniques (Stokes’ equation and the direct simulation Monte Carlo treatment) for determining droplet trajectories are contrasted.},

 abstract = {To reduce the computational costs related to direct simulation Monte Carlo computations for low Knudsen number flows, a new particle method, based on the ellipsoidal statistical Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook model of the Boltzmann equation, is investigated. In this method, a fraction of the computational particles in a cell is selected for velocity reassignment from the local Maxwellian distribution based the local collision frequency and an even smaller fraction is selected for internal mode energy reassignment based on the rotational and vibrational relaxation rates. A scaling algorithm is used to decrease the required number of particles per cell and to guarantee that the energy and momentum are conserved in each time step. The accuracy and efficiency of the ellipsoidal statistical Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook method are tested in three different test cases and the results are compared with the direct simulation Monte Carlo solution and experiment as well. The ellipsoidal statistical Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook approach is found to provide good agreement with direct simulation Monte Carlo solutions, however, a factor of 2 speed up compared with direct simulation Monte Carlo is only achieved when the collision frequency is sufficiently high.},

 abstract = {A numerical model is developed to consider for the first time droplet coalescence along with transport, heating and desolvation in an argon inductively coupled plasma (Ar ICP). The direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method and the Ashgriz–Poo model are used, respectively, to compute droplet–droplet interactions and to determine the outcome of droplet collisions. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations support the use of the Ashgriz–Poo coalescence model for small droplet coalescence. Simulations predict spatial maps of droplet number and mass densities within an Ar ICP for a conventional nebulizer-spray chamber arrangement, a direct injection high efficiency nebulizer (DIHEN), and a large bore DIHEN (LB-DIHEN). The primary findings are: (1) even at 1500 W, the collisions of the droplets in the plasma lead primarily to coalescence, particularly for direct aerosol injection; (2) the importance of coalescence in a spray simulation exhibits a complex relationship with the gas temperature and droplet size; (3) DIHEN droplets penetrate further into the Ar ICP when coalescence is considered; and (4) droplets from a spray chamber or the LB-DIHEN coalesce less frequently than those from a DIHEN. The implications of these predictions in spectrochemical analysis in ICP spectrometry are discussed.},

 abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to model an electrospray thruster for the ionic liquid (IL) EMIM-BF4 using two coarse-grained (CG) potentials. Different equilibrium properties were obtained for the two potentials and then both were used to study the electrical extrusion of the IL for different electric field strengths and mass flow rates. The MD simulations provide the first insight into the atomistic modeling of a capillary-tip-extractor system, the basic elements of an electrospray thruster. One of the CG potentials was found to predict the formation of the Taylor cone, the cone-jet, and other extrusion modes for similar electric fields and mass flow rates observed in experiments of a IL fed capillary-tip-extractor system. Current distributions and anion and cation behavior were characterized and estimates of thrust and specific impulse are presented and compare reasonably well with measurements. Moreover, the role of inhomogeneities in the electric field as well as that of the IL space-charge most likely will improve agreement between modeling and experiment.},

DTIC Paper No. AEDC-TR-80-16, 1980]. To simulate this case, a new kinetic-based model of N2 molecules condensing on CO2 nuclei was developed using molecular dynamics techniques and was implemented in the DSMC simulation of the expanding mixture. Pure nitrogen flow for the same expansion conditions was observed to not produce any clusters. It was found that incorporation of the heterogeneous condensation process of N2 molecules condensing on CO2 nuclei causes the average N2 cluster size to increase from 10 (the homogeneous condensation result) to about 2000. The simulated Rayleigh scattering intensity results were found to agree well with the experimental data.},

 abstract = {The sensitivity of a rarefied-to-transitional flow to the fidelity of the chemical reaction model is investigated for a new molecular dynamics/quasiclassical trajectory (MD/QCT)-derived model and compared with the widely used total collision energy (TCE) model of Bird. For hypervelocity collisions that occur in the space environment, it is not clear, a priori, that the TCE model will provide reasonable results for the required high energy range and, particularly, if strong favoring of the reaction among different forms of reactant energy occurs. In fact, in previous work, the TCE model, using available Arrhenius parameters, has been found, for these flow conditions, to give unphysical probabilities. A chemical reaction model, suitable for use in the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, is developed to simulate the hypervelocity collisions of O(P3)+HCl(Σ+1)→OH(Π2)+Cl(P2), an example of an important reaction in high-altitude atmospheric-jet interactions. The model utilizes the MD/QCT method with a new benchmark triplet A″ surface. Since the modeling of chemical reactions in DSMC simulations requires the use of a reaction probability, the adequacy of the overall collision cross section, usually modeled by the variable hard sphere (VHS) model, is also considered. To obtain an accurate collision cross section, the approach of Tokumasu and Matsumoto was used in the MD/QCT method with the aforementioned potential energy surface. Energy transfer between the target HCl translational and internal energy modes was investigated and it was found that the variation of the inelastic cross section has a negligible effect on the transport cross section. Therefore, a MD/QCT VHS equivalent collision cross section was obtained and along with the MD/QCT reaction cross sections were utilized in the full DSMC calculation of the flow field. It was found that for a low enthalpy reaction, in hypervelocity collisions, the TCE model with accurate Arrhenius rates appears to agree well with the rigorous MD/QCT calculations which shows that the reaction does not exhibit strong favoring.},

 abstract = {Ultrahigh Mach number re-entry vehicles create sufficiently energetic flow conditions with substantial ionization occurring in the noncontinuum flow regime. To model these noncontinuum, ionized, and thermochemically nonequilibrium flows, a direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) approach is investigated. Energy exchange models that have been developed for Navier–Stokes computational fluid dynamics computations are examined and revised for application to the DSMC method. Since the electron–heavy particle collision rate is approximately two orders of magnitude higher than that between heavy particles, a new model is developed for electron scattering collision processes and electron-vibrational energy exchange based on the electron-molecule shape resonance phenomena. It is found that the flow electron and vibrational temperatures are sensitive to the electron-vibrational relaxation model because the relaxation time changes by orders of magnitude. The DSMC calculations of the bow-shock region of a blunt body were found to predict the correct flow features for free stream Knudsen numbers spanning the near-free molecular to the continuum limit. The range of degree of ionization was found to vary from the highest altitude to the lowest from 1% to 11%.},

 abstract = {In previous work, a cluster evaporation model was derived from the classical nucleation theory (CNT) to simulate condensation in free expanding plumes using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. However, the use of a CNT evaporation model, especially in a low temperature environment, is problematic because macroparameters such as cluster surface tension and vapor saturation pressure are not physical for small cluster sizes. In this work, we propose a kinetic based evaporation model obtained from unimolecular dissociation theory (UDT) to model argon cluster evaporation processes in a free expanding plume. The UDT argon cluster evaporation model has been directly verified by molecular dynamics and quasiclassical trajectory simulations. It is found that although there is about one order of magnitude difference in the CNT and UDT evaporation rates, these two theories predict similar cluster evaporation rate trends as a function of cluster size and temperature. The verified new UDT evaporation model, as well as the previous CNT model, are applied to a free expanding argon condensation plume simulated with DSMC. The simulation results show that although there are some differences in cluster number density and average cluster size using the CNT and UDT evaporation models, the condensation onset conditions and Rayleigh scattering intensity for both models agree reasonably well with experimental data.},

In this work, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a free expansion to explore the microscopic mechanisms of water dimer formation and develop collision models required by DSMC. Bimolecular and termolecular dimer cluster formation mechanisms are considered and the former is found to be the main mechanism in expanding flows to vacuum. MD simulations between two water molecules using the simple point charge intermolecular potential were performed to predict the bimolecular dimer formation probability and the probability was found to decrease with collision energy. The formation probabilities and postcollisional velocity and energy distributions were then integrated into DSMC simulations of a free expansion of an orifice condensation plume with different chamber stagnation temperatures and pressures. The dimer mole fraction was found to increase with distance from the orifice and become constant after a distance of about two orifice diameters. Similar to experiment, the terminal dimer mole fraction was found to decrease with chamber stagnation temperatures and increase linearly with chamber stagnation pressures which is consistent with a bimolecular nucleation mechanism.},

In addition, the sensitivity of the sticking probability to cluster size decreases as the temperature decreases. Comparison of the Ashgriz-Poo semiempirical coalescence model with MD simulations show that for cluster sizes larger than 100 the former model may be used. To model homogeneous nucleation in an ammonia jet, direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) simulations were performed for different stagnation pressure conditions using the MD simulation outcomes for smaller cluster-cluster collisions and the Ashgriz-Poo model for cluster sizes larger than 100.

 abstract = {In the present work, we have simulated the homogeneous condensation of carbon dioxide and ethanol using the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook based approach. In an earlier work of Gallagher-Rogers et al. [J. Thermophys. Heat Transfer 22, 695 (2008)], it was found that it was not possible to simulate condensation experiments of Wegener et al. [Phys. Fluids 15, 1869 (1972)] using the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. Therefore, in this work, we have used the statistical Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook approach, which was found to be numerically more efficient than direct simulation Monte Carlo method in our previous studies [Kumar et al., AIAA J. 48, 1531 (2010)], to model homogeneous condensation of two small polyatomic systems, carbon dioxide and ethanol. A new weighting scheme is developed in the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook framework to reduce the computational load associated with the study of homogeneous condensation flows. The solutions obtained by the use of the new scheme are compared with those obtained by the baseline Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook condensation model (without the species weighting scheme) for the condensing flow of carbon dioxide in the stagnation pressure range of 1-5 bars. Use of the new weighting scheme in the present work makes the simulation of homogeneous condensation of ethanol possible. We obtain good agreement between our simulated predictions for homogeneous condensation of ethanol and experiments in terms of the point of condensation onset and the distribution of mass fraction of ethanol condensed along the nozzle centerline.},

 abstract = {In this work, we propose a new heat accommodation model to simulate freely expanding homogeneous condensation flows of gaseous carbon dioxide using a new approach, the statistical Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook method. The motivation for the present work comes from the earlier work of Li et al. [J. Phys. Chem. 114, 5276 (2010)] in which condensation models were proposed and used in the direct simulation Monte Carlo method to simulate the flow of carbon dioxide from supersonic expansions of small nozzles into near-vacuum conditions. Simulations conducted for stagnation pressures of one and three bar were compared with the measurements of gas and cluster number densities, cluster size, and carbon dioxide rotational temperature obtained by Ramos et al. [Phys. Rev. A 72, 3204 (2005)]. Due to the high computational cost of direct simulation Monte Carlo method, comparison between simulations and data could only be performed for these stagnation pressures, with good agreement obtained beyond the condensation onset point, in the farfield. As the stagnation pressure increases, the degree of condensation also increases; therefore, to improve the modeling of condensation onset, one must be able to simulate higher stagnation pressures. In simulations of an expanding flow of argon through a nozzle, Kumar et al. [AIAA J. 48, 1531 (2010)] found that the statistical Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook method provides the same accuracy as direct simulation Monte Carlo method, but, at one half of the computational cost. In this work, the statistical Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook method was modified to account for internal degrees of freedom for multi-species polyatomic gases. With the computational approach in hand, we developed and tested a new heat accommodation model for a polyatomic system to properly account for the heat release of condensation. We then developed condensation models in the framework of the statistical Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook method. Simulations were found to agree well with the experiment for all stagnation pressure cases (1-5 bar), validating the accuracy of the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook based condensation model in capturing the physics of condensation.},

The study explores the influence of electronic states on the flow chemistry and degree of ionization as well as the assumption that the electronic states can be described by a steady state solution to a system of rate equations of excitation, de-excitation, and radiative transfer processes. The work implements selected excited levels of atomic nitrogen and oxygen and the corresponding electron impact excitation/de-excitation and ionization processes in DSMC. The simulations show that when excitation models are included, the degree of ionization in the Stardust transitional re-entry flow increases due to additional intermediate steps to ionization. The extra ionization reactions consume the electron energy to reduce the electron temperature. The DSMC predicted excited state level populations are lower than those predicted by a quasi steady state calculation, but the differences can be understood in terms of the flow distribution functions.},

 abstract = {Using molecular dynamics (MD), we have studied the mechanism of heat accommodation between carbon dioxide clusters and monomers for temperatures and cluster size conditions that exist in homogeneous condensing supersonic expansion plumes. The work was motivated by our meso-scale direct simulation Monte Carlo and Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook based condensation simulations where we found that the heat accommodation model plays a key role in the near-field of the nozzle expansion particularly as the degree of condensation increases [R. Kumar, Z. Li, and D. Levin, Phys. Fluids 23, 052001 (2011)]. The heat released by nucleation and condensation and the heat removed by cluster evaporation can be transferred or removed from either the kinetic or translational modes of the carbon dioxide monomers. The molecular dynamics results show that the time required for gas-cluster interactions to establish an equilibrium from an initial state of non-equilibrium is less than the time step used in meso-scale analyses [R. Kumar, Z. Li, and D. Levin, Phys. Fluids 23, 052001 (2011)]. Therefore, the good agreement obtained between the measured cluster and gas number density and gas temperature profiles with the meso-scale modeling using the second energy exchange mechanism is not fortuitous but is physically based. Our MD simulations also showed that a dynamic equilibrium is established by the gas-cluster interactions in which condensation and evaporation processes take place constantly to and from a cluster.},

In this work, collisions between SO(2) and O were studied using molecular dynamics/quasi-classical trajectories methods with the potential of Murrell and a force field for reactive systems (ReaxFF). Dissociation to SO was found to be the significant reacting process, but at higher collision energies, complete atomization of SO(2) was found to frequently occur. In contrast, dissociation to O(2) was found to be mostly negligible and formation of SO(3) occurred only at low impact velocities. The chemistry and collision models developed from the Murrell and ReaxFF methods were implemented in DSMC simulations and compared to the baseline DSMC collision and reaction models.

 abstract = {Recent potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the N2 + N and N2 + N2 systems are used in molecular dynamics (MD) to simulate rates of vibrational and rotational relaxations for conditions that occur in hypersonic flows. For both chemical systems, it is found that the rotational relaxation number increases with the translational temperature and decreases as the rotational temperature approaches the translational temperature. The vibrational relaxation number is observed to decrease with translational temperature and approaches the rotational relaxation number in the high temperature region. The rotational and vibrational relaxation numbers are generally larger in the N2 + N2 system. MD-quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) with the PESs is also used to calculate the V-T transition cross sections, the collision cross section, and the dissociation cross section for each collision pair. Direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) results for hypersonic flow over a blunt body with the total collision cross section from MD/QCT simulations, Larsen-Borgnakke with new relaxation numbers, and the N2 dissociation rate from MD/QCT show a profile with a decreased translational temperature and a rotational temperature close to vibrational temperature. The results demonstrate that many of the physical models employed in DSMC should be revised as fundamental potential energy surfaces suitable for high temperature conditions become available. },

 abstract = {A high fidelity internal energy relaxation model for N2–N suitable for use in direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) modeling of chemically reacting flows is proposed. A novel two-dimensional binning approach with variable bin energy resolutions in the rotational and vibrational modes is developed for treating the internal mode of N2. Both bin-to-bin and state-specific relaxation cross sections are obtained using the molecular dynamics/quasi-classical trajectory (MD/QCT) method with two potential energy surfaces as well as the state-specific database of Jaffe et al. The MD/QCT simulations of inelastic energy exchange between N2 and N show that there is a strong forward-preferential scattering behavior at high collision velocities. The 99 bin model is used in homogeneous DSMC relaxation simulations and is found to be able to recover the state-specific master equation results of Panesi et al. when the Jaffe state-specific cross sections are used. Rotational relaxation energy profiles and relaxation times obtained using the ReaxFF and Jaffe potential energy surfaces (PESs) are in general agreement but there are larger differences between the vibrational relaxation times. These differences become smaller as the translational temperature increases because the difference in the PES energy barrier becomes less important.},

 abstract = {Vibration–dissociation coupling in low-density, hypersonic flows of air is investigated. Radiative emission data for nitric oxide and for atomic oxygen measured by a reentry flight experiment are used to assess the modeling of this phenomenon. Flow field computations are performed using the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. Due to the relatively small number of collisions under high-altitude, low-density flow conditions, an overlay approach is used to simulate changes in chemical composition of trace species, including both nitric oxide and atomic oxygen. Radiative emission is calculated using a nonequilibrium radiation method. It is found that the strong degree of thermal nonequilibrium that occurs in high-altitude, hypersonic flows makes the chemistry very sensitive to the vibration–dissociation coupling model. A number of such models based on continuum and particle representations of the flow are assessed. A variation in dissociation rate of up to nine orders of magnitude among these models is found for the lowest-density flight conditions. By using a sophisticated dissociation model, the emission calculated at the highest altitude for which measurements are available is improved from a factor of 220 too low to within a factor of 4 too low. With the same model, improvement by a factor of 50 is also obtained for the computation of emission from atomic oxygen. This is the first time that the observed dependence of the flight data on the free-stream density has been predicted correctly.},

The various atomic parameters required for calculating the resonant enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) probabilities are obtained using quantum-defect theory. The infinite sums over nonresonant states are truncated at a finite number of terms. Our calculated two-photon excitation cross sections agree well with the results of other recent calculations and of experimental measurements. The photoionization cross section is calculated for various electron kinetic energies. The REMPI dynamics is analyzed by solving the density-matrix equations. This framework consistently takes into account the effects of saturation and ac Stark shifts. REMPI probability is seen to be quite sensitive to the initial detuning, the intensity, and the particular resonant state accessed. The photoionization cross sections also imply that due to the rapid falloff of the cross section, two-color REMPI schemes with a lower-frequency ionizing photon would increase the effective REMPI probability.},

 abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are coupled to solutions of Poisson's equation to study the effects of the electrical boundary conditions on the emission modes of an electrospray thruster fed with an ionic liquid. A comparison of a new tip boundary condition with an analytical model based on a semihyperboloidal shape offers good agreement, although the analytical model overestimates the maximum value of the tangential electric field since it does not take into account the space charge that reduces the field at the liquid surface. It is found that a constant electric field model gives similar agreement to the more rigorous and computationally expensive tip boundary condition at lower flow rates. However, at higher mass flow rates the constant electric field produces extruded particles with higher Coulomb energy per ion, consistent with droplet formation. Furthermore, the MD simulations show that ion emission sites differ based on the boundary condition and snapshots offer an explanation as to why some boundary condition models will predict emission in a purely ionic mode, whereas others suggest a mixed ion-droplet regime. Finally, specific impulses and thrusts are compared for the different models and are found to vary up to 30% due to differences in the average charge to mass ratio. },

A transient 3-D electric field was used at each timestep, taking into account the induced electric field due to space charge repulsion. It was found that the inhomogeneous electric field as well as that of the IL space-charge improved agreement between modeling and experiment. The influence of numerical parameters, such as extraction potential and applied mass flow, was studied. Particular emphasis was put on the importance of parameters relative to the grid used to solve Poisson’s equation, such as the grid cell size and the boundary conditions (BCs) in the vicinity of the capillary tip.

 abstract = {The physics of neutral and ion species in plume expansions to vacuum is challenging due to the wide variation in length and time scales. To address the multiscale nature of these flows, a grid approach known as adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) combined with the octree method has been used with direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) and particle-in-cell solvers to model the plumes of small ion thruster expansions to vacuum. Single- and triple-thruster geometries have been simulated with the inclusion of the well-known charge exchange (CEX) reactions that transfer energy from energetic xenon ions to neutrals. A multispecies timestep, species weighting factors, and local timestep adaptation are employed to simulate the interactions between major and trace, ion species. Three grids for modeling particle collisions, interactions with the electric field, and visualization have been developed in a parallel code that has good scalability. Comparison studies are presented between a two-level Cartesian-based DSMC solver and our new code in terms of accuracy of results and simulation cost. CEX collisions are shown to produce back flow in both single- and triple-thruster configurations and increase the ion number density up to 10% near the thruster exit. For the 3-D, triple-thruster case, the combined plume interaction region was automatically captured by the AMR-octree mesh.},

Comparisons between vacuum chamber and space simulations show that the spatial distribution of the neutral densities are different in the far downstream region of the ion thruster. The change in the background density is also found to affect the spatial distributions of the charge–exchange ions in the domain.

 abstract = {With respect to our modeling of condensation in supersonic expansions, we have used molecular dynamics to derive condensation based models for DSMC for non-Lennard Jonesian gases such as water, carbon dioxide, and ammonia, common combustion products found in rocket plumes. The challenge was to incorporate charge polarization terms in the cluster potential, develop and automate a strategy for recognizing the formation of clusters in an MD study of a supersonic expansion, and utilize a parallel MD code to deduce the important cluster formation mechanism in a large scale MD simulation of a jet expansion. In addition, we have extended our research to model heterogeneous condensation, a necessary feature for realistic plume flows which often include multiple species types. The developed MD models have been incorporated into the DSMC simulations, a process that takes the fine-grained simulation results and transfers them to the propulsion/nozzle system level. DSMC simulations have been compared with published Raman and Rayleigh scattering laboratory measurements, high lighting the need for this data for more molecular systems.},

 abstract = {Full-spectrum k-distribution (FSK) and multi-group FSK approaches make it possible to evaluate radiative fluxes at a fraction of the cost needed for line-by-line calculations. However, the required k-distributions need to be assembled from accurate absorption coefficient data for each flow condition, which is computationally expensive. An accurate and compact narrow-band k-distribution database has been developed for the most important species encountered in hypersonic nonequilibrium flow. The database allows users to calculate desired full-spectrum k-distributions through look-up and interpolation. Strategies for k-distribution data generation are outlined. The accuracy of the database is tested by comparing narrow-band mean absorption coefficients and narrow-band emissivities with those obtained from line-by-line calculations. Application of the database to construct full-spectrum k-distributions accurately and efficiently is discussed, and results from a number of heat transfer calculations and cpu-time studies are presented.Copyright © 2009 by ASME},

 abstract = {In this paper, efficient spectral modules and random number databases are developed for atomic and diatomic species for use in photon Monte Carlo (PMC) modeling of hypersonic nonequilibrium flow radiation. To model nonequilibrium flow conditions, the quasi steady state (QSS) assumption was used to generate electronic state populations of atomic and diatomic gas species in the databases. For atomic species (N and O), both bound-bound transitions and continuum radiation were included, and were separately databased as a function of electron temperature and number density as well as the ratio of atomic ion to neutral number density. For the radiating diatomic species of N2+, N2 , O2 , and NO, databases were generated for each electronic molecular electronic system. In each molecular electronic system, the ro-vibrational transition lines were separately databased for each electronic upper state population forming the electronic system. The spectral module for the PMC method was optimized toward computational efficiency for emission calculations, wavelength selections of photon bundles and absorption coefficient calculations in the ray tracing scheme.Copyright © 2009 by ASME},

Modeling such devices is challenging due to their high plasma density, reactive environments and low pressures that place them in a quasi-molecular flow regime.

 abstract = {An innovative model of an ionic liquid electrospray thruster based on Molecular Dynamics was developed. Two coarsegrained potentials1(a simple coarse-grained and an effective-force coarse-grained(EFCG)) models were used, rather than an all-atom model, to model an entire electrospray thruster. First, the impact of the coarse-grained model on the ionic liquid EMIM-BF4 was studied. A system representing an electrospray capillary was then equilibrated for both CG potentials, and an extrusion model was developed based on a repulsive wall potential to simulate a constant mass flow inside the capillary. Multiple constant electric fields were applied to the system and the mass flow rate was also varied. Three ionic species, monomers(EMIM+), dimers([EMIM-BF4]EMIM+) and trimers([EMIM-BF4]2EMIM+), as well as droplets(charged clusters larger than 8 ions) were observed and their distributions were recorded at a distance 0.1 µm away from the center of the capillary at a virtual extractor ring. Current values were derived from the measured distributions. The formation of a Taylor cone was observed when the mass flow was sufficiently high. The EFCG potential replicated an experimental setup best for an electric field of 0.5 V/nm, where solvated ions and droplets were observed. The computed values provided a good match for the values measured by Romero et al.2, especially at low mass flow rates. When the mass flow rate increased, larger droplets tended to break apart and lead to an increase in the monomer current. Higher values of the electric field resulted in almost exclusively monomers being extruded and the prediction that the electrospray would operate in a multi-jet mode, hence over-estimating the measured current values. When the polarity was reversed, very similar results were obtained, paving the way for the use of EMIM-BF4 as an efficient propellant for arrays of emitters with switching polarities, that would require no neutralizing system. Thrust and specific impulses were estimated based on the exit velocities of charged clusters. The estimated thrust generally offered good agreement with measured values while the specific impulses were under-estimated. Finally, similar computations were done on a simple CG based potential model. The interatomic potential in the simple CG model required a higher external energy to extrude charged particles from the capillary, when compared to the EFCG model.},

However, results of a reacting air flow case indicate that the size of the separation length, and the movement of the triple point toward to the leading edge is much less than the nitrogen case.},

The numerical results were compared with experiments conducted in the HET facility for a high-enthalpy pure nitrogen flow corresponding to a free stream Mach number of approximately seven. Since the conditions for the double wedge case are near-continuum and surface heat flux and size of the separation are sensitive to DSMC numerical parameters, special attention was paid to the convergence of these parameters for both geometries. At the beginning of the simulation, the separation zone was predicted to be small and the heat flux values for the 2-D model were comparable to the experimental data. However, for increasing time, it was observed that the heat flux values and shock profile strongly deviated from the experiment. Investigation of a three-dimensional model showed that the flow is truly three-dimensional and the side edge pressure relief provides good agreement between simulations and the experiment.},

The 99 bin model is used in homogeneous DSMC relaxation simulations and is found to be able to recover the state-specific master equation results of Panesi et al. when the Jaffe state-specific cross sections are used. Rotational relaxation energy profiles and relaxation times obtained using the ReaxFF and Jaffe potential energy surfaces (PESs) are in general agreement but there are larger differences between the vibrational relaxation times.

 abstract = {Modeling of the high altitude portion of reentry vehicle trajectories with DSMC or statistical BGK solvers requires accurate evaluation of the boundary conditions at the ablating TPS surface. Presented in this article is a model which takes into account the complex ablation physics including the production of pyrolysis gases, and chemistry at the TPS surface. Since the ablation process is time dependent the modeling of the material response to the high energy reentry flow starts with the solution of the rarefied flow over the vehicle and then loosely couples with the material response. The objective of the present work is to carry out conjugate thermal analysis by weakly coupling a flow solver to a material thermal response model. The latter model solves the one dimensional heat conduction equation accounting for the pyrolysis process that takes place in the reaction zone of an ablative thermal protection system (TPS) material. An estimate of the temperature range within which the pyrolysis reaction (decomposition and volatilization) takes place is obtained from Ref. [1]. The pyrolysis reaction results in the formation of char and the release of gases through the porous charred material. These gases remove additional amount of heat as they pass through the material, thus cooling the material (the process known as transpiration cooling). In the present work, we incorporate the transpiration cooling model in the material thermal response code in addition to the pyrolysis model. The flow in the boundary layer and in the vicinity of the TPS material is in the transitional flow regime. Therefore, we use a previously validated statistical BGK method [2] to model the flow physics in the vicinity of the micro‐cracks, since the BGK method allows simulations of flow at pressures higher than can be computed using DSMC.},

 abstract = {Statistical BGK/DSMC and continuum N‐S simulations of a typical vehicle reentry flow were performed taking into account local flow features. The local surface features were known to cause problems during the Apollo era Earth atmosphere reentry Ref. [1] and therefore require close attention as the shapes and design details of the new reentry vehicles tend to build on the Apollo reentry capsules. The TPS thermal response to the high energy reentry flow in cracks and compression pad areas is important to understand to predict the TPS degradation due to the chemical and thermal ablation. The TPS study presented in this article includes the stagnation area micro crack and compression pads which disturb the flow and cause local augmentation of heat flux, which in turn, results in higher recession rates.},

The structure of the steady wave solution is determined solving the system of the Rankine‐Hugoniot conditions supplemented with the rate law, in a chemical regime which corresponds to the early stage of the reaction process. The response of such steady wave solution to one‐dimensional disturbances is investigated using a normal mode linear analysis which leads to an initial value problem for the state variable disturbances in the reaction zone. Some results are obtained numerically in order to describe the stability spectra of the steady solution. The emphasis of the present study is on the influence of the reaction heat on the linear stability spectra.},

 abstract = {Studies of equilibrium breakdown were done for two flow problems representative of typical conditions for vehicles reentering the Earth atmosphere. The first studied problem was a 81 km Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) re‐entry flow, with additional considerations for local flow features along the stagnation line. The second problem was a classical Couette flow, a volume of gas confined between two fast moving parallel plates of indefinite length and width. Both of the problems were solved by the DSMC technique with the particle velocity data collected to compute the distribution function at the areas of interest. In the case of stagnation line flow, a strong shock wave, formed in front of the vehicle at an altitude of 81 km was studied, and in the case of Couette flow, a high velocity boundary layer was examined in details at different Knudsen numbers. For both of the cases the Kolmogorov‐Smirnov (K‐S) test was applied to determine the degree of local flow non‐equilibrium with following considerations regarding the applicability of coupled statistical BGK and DSMC techniques in the semi‐rarefied flow regimes where the use of the baseline DSMC is limited due to the computational cost.},

It was found in those studies that the heat accommodation model played a key role in the numerical reproduction of the experiments. The major assumption made in such a heat accommodation model was the instantaneous release of heat of condensation to the gas particles in a cell. In the present work, we examine the veracity of the assumption used in the heat accommodation model, and understand the heat accommodation mechanism in general. To this end, we have used the atomistic molecular dynamics method to study the gas‐cluster interactions from a fundamental standpoint. It is found that the time taken by gas‐cluster interactions to establish an equilibrium from an initial state of non‐equilibrium is less than the time step used in meso‐scale analysis [1]. We also find that a dynamic equilibrium is established by the gas‐cluster interactions in which condensation and evaporation constantly takes place to and from a cluster.},

 abstract = {Low pressure plasma reactors are important tools for ionized metal physical vapor deposition (IMPVD), a semiconductor plasma processing technology that is increasingly being applied to deposit Cu seed layers on semiconductor surfaces of trenches and vias with the high aspect ratio (e.g., >5:1). A large fraction of ionized atoms produced by the IMPVD process leads to an anisotropic deposition flux towards the substrate, a feature which is critical for attaining a void‐free and uniform fill. Modeling such devices is challenging due to their high plasma density, reactive environment, but low gas pressure. A modular code developed by the Computational Optical and Discharge Physics Group, the Hybrid Plasma Equipment Model (HPEM), has been successfully applied to the numerical investigations of IMPVD by modeling a hollow cathode magnetron (HCM) device. However, as the development of semiconductor devices progresses towards the lower pressure regime (e.g., <5 mTorr), the breakdown of the continuum assumption limits the application of the fluid model in HPEM and suggests the incorporation of the kinetic method, such as the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), in the plasma simulation. The DSMC method, which solves the Boltzmann equation of transport, has been successfully applied in modeling micro‐fluidic flows in MEMS devices with low Reynolds numbers, a feature shared with the HCM. Modeling of the basic physical and chemical processes for ion/neutral species in plasma have been developed and implemented in DSMC, which include ion particle motion due to the Lorentz force, electron impact reactions, charge exchange reactions, and charge recombination at the surface. The heating of neutrals due to collisions with ions and the heating of ions due to the electrostatic field will be shown to be captured by the DSMC simulations. In this work, DSMC calculations were coupled with the modules from HPEM so that the plasma can be self‐consistently solved. Differences in the Ar results, the dominant species in the reactor, produced by the DSMC‐HPEM coupled simulation will be shown in comparison with the original HPEM results. The effects of the DSMC calculations for ion/neutral species on HPEM plasma simulation will be further analyzed.},

The extra ionization reactions consume the electron energy and reduce the electron temperature. The DSMC results of number densities of excited levels are lower than the prediction of quasi steady state calculation.

Three possible dissociation reactions are modeled, and reaction cross sections, σr,MD, and the equivalent variable hard sphere (VHS) cross sections, σVHS,MD, are obtained based on the MD/QCT results. The ratio of σr,MD to σVHS,MD indicate that in high collision velocity regime the dissociation reaction is the dominant process. Reaction probabilities are further obtained by using the sum of the reaction cross section and equivalent VHS cross section as the total collision cross section. This method provides the consistent total collision cross sections and reaction probabilities that can be applied in direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) for large range of total collisional energies whereas the VHS cross section and the reaction probability from the total collision energy (TCE) model cannot be applied in high collision velocity regime that needs to be modeled.},

 abstract = {One dimensional Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) simulations are used to examine the interaction of the jovian plasma torus with Io’s sublimation atmosphere. The hot plasma sweeps past Io at ∼57 km/s due to the external Jovian magnetic and corotational electric fields and the resultant energetic collisions both heat and dissociate the neutral gas creating an inflated, mixed atmosphere of SO2 and its daughter products. The vertical structure and composition of the atmosphere is important for understanding Io’s mass loading of the plasma torus, electron excited aurora, and Io’s global gas dynamics. Our 1D simulations above a fixed location on the surface of Io allows the O+ and S+ ions to drift down into the domain where they then undergo elastic and charge exchange collisions with the neutral gas. Each electron’s position is determined by the motion of a corresponding ion; however, the electrons retain their own velocity components which are then used during elastic, ionization, and excitation collisions with the neutral gas. Charge exchange creates fast neutral O and S atoms. Molecular Dynamic/Quasi–Classical Trajectory (MD/QCT) calculations are used to generate total and reaction cross sections for energetic O+SO2 collisions [1] as well as for O+O2 collisions. In addition, the model accounts for photo‐dissociation assuming the atmosphere is optically thin. Our previous plasma heating model (without chemistry) agrees well with the vertical structure of the current model at lower altitudes where the gas is collisional; however, at high altitudes (>100 km) significant differences among the models appear. The current model’s constant E and B fields results in reacceleration of the ions and electrons to a constant E×B drift velocity towards the surface after collisions with the neutral gas and, while the results are an upper limit on the plasma interaction strength, the results indicate that joule heating is significant, causing large changes in the vertical structure of the atmosphere. Plasma heating of, not momentum transfer to, the atmosphere dominates even for radially inward plasma flows resulting in a hot, inflated atmosphere. The scale heights for the various species were found to be a competition between the hydrodynamic scale height based on the gas constant (for the mixture if collisional) and the production rate from dissociation of SO2 which depends on the local SO2 density and available plasma energy at that altitude.},

 abstract = {A significant process in the formation of the unique atmosphere of Io, a Jovian moon, is collision-induced dissociation of sulfur dioxide. The rarefied nature of the Ionian atmosphere makes its simulation by the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method (DSMC) the method of choice. However, there is a lack of reliable data on collisions, particularly reaction and collision cross sections needed for DSMC, of Ionian species at the conditions seen in its atmosphere. As such, collisions between SO2 and O are studied through Molecular Dynamics, Quasi-Classical Trajectories using two different methods for determining molecular potential: a polynomial potential defined by Murrell [1] and a complex tunable potential defined by the ReaxFF force field. Five possible reaction paths are considered: atomization of the SO2 molecule, dissociation to SO, dissociation to O2, and the formation of SO3, and an exchange reaction leading to SO and O2. Relative velocities and initial SO2 internal energies relevant to Io's atmospheric conditions are used. The results from each chemistry model are analyzed and compared to each other, in particular the reaction cross sections and equivalent variable hard sphere cross sections. In general, higher collision energies are found to cause atomization of the SO2. In addition, dissociation to SO is a significant process for many of the studied cases, but dissociation to O2 is mostly a negligible process. Finally, formation of SO3 occurs only at low impact velocities. The chemistry and collision models developed from the Murrell and ReaxFF methods are then implemented in DSMC 0-D, time-dependant and 2-D axisymmetric simulations under conditions relevant to the Ionian atmosphere. The results of these analyses are examined, and compared to results obtained using the baseline Total Collisional Energy (TCE) model and the previous results of Deng et al [2]. It is found that the new Murrell and ReaxFF based models predict less SO2 dissociation than previous models, and that simulated Ionian atmospheric structure is sensitive to the total cross section model.},

For bound-free and free-free transition, absorption cross sections are calculated using correction factor data, and are databased with relatively coarse wavelength spacing. For flow nonequilibrium, a rate equation approach including both collisional and radiatively induced transitions is needed to calculate the electronic state populations. By using the quasi-steady-state assumption (QSS), excited state populations of nonequilibrium gas species were calculated in terms of flow temperatures, species concentrations, excitation cross-sections, and radiative life times.

In the absence of an external electric field, long alkyl chains were observed in EAN but not in EOAN. When the electric field was applied, the anions of both ILs formed a barrier along the applied field, but only in EAN did this barrier result in a static bilayer composed of two parallel layers of cations and anions. The primary hydrogen bonds (HBs) connecting the EAN cations and anions were formed between the ammonium and the nitrate groups.

Here, we perform scale-bridging molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on a reactive-force-field (ReaxFF) potential to elucidate the pyrolysis kinetics of a highly crosslinked phenolic formaldehyde resin. We show that bulk pyrolysis starts at temperatures of ∼500 K, and exhibits a temperature dependence that follows the Arrhenius law. The pyrolysis process initiates with the removal of –OH functional groups and –H atoms from aromatic C rings within the bulk phenolic resin to release H2O, followed by breaking of these C rings to release C-based fragments. Using the pyrolysis rates from MD simulations, we develop a thermal material response model applied to predict the heat transfer within a charring syntactic foam ablator. Our model predictions of the char thickness and temperature distributions, under a variety of heat loads, are in good agreement with prior experiments.},

Furthermore, the formation of the Taylor cone was found to depend on the mass flow rate and the external electric field strength.

 abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) electrospray simulations of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIM-BF_{4}) ion liquid were performed with the goal of evaluating the influence of long-range Coulomb models on ion emission characteristics. The direct Coulomb (DC), shifted force Coulomb sum (SFCS), and particle-particle particle-mesh (PPPM) long-range Coulomb models were considered in this work. The DC method with a sufficiently large cutoff radius was found to be the most accurate approach for modeling electrosprays, but, it is computationally expensive. The Coulomb potential energy modeled by the DC method in combination with the radial electric fields were found to be necessary to generate the Taylor cone. The differences observed between the SFCS and the DC in terms of predicting the total ion emission suggest that the former should not be used in MD electrospray simulations. Furthermore, the common assumption of domain periodicity was observed to be detrimental to the accuracy of the capillary-based electrospray simulations.},

The translational energy and angular distributions of the scattered N2 were obtained for incidence energies near 30 and 68 kJ mol–1, incidence angles of 30°, 45°, and 70°, and a surface temperature of 677 K. The trajectories of scattered nitrogen molecules were found to fall into three main categories, i.e., single collision, multiple collisions with escape, and multiple collisions without escape. While the conventional GSI models did not match the translational energy and angular distributions obtained from the experiments, the results obtained from MD simulations were found to be in good agreement. The MD simulations also showed that the number of surface layers used to model the HOPG surface and the carbon–nitrogen Lennard-Jones potential are important in improving the agreement between the simulations and the experiments.},

 abstract = {Shock-dominated hypersonic laminar flows over a double cone are investigated using time accurate direct simulation Monte Carlo combined with the residuals algorithm for unit Reynolds numbers gradually increasing from 9.35 × 104 to 3.74 × 105 m−1 at a Mach number of about 16. The main flow features, such as the strong bow-shock, location of the separation shock, the triple point, and the entire laminar separated region, show a time-dependent behavior. Although the separation shock angle is found to be similar for all Re numbers, the effects of Reynolds number on the structure and extent of the separation region are profound. As the Reynolds number is increased, larger pressure values in the under-expanded jet region due to strong shock interactions form more prominent λ-shocklets in the supersonic region between two contact surfaces. Likewise, the surface parameters, especially on the second cone surface, show a strong dependence on the Reynolds number, with skin friction, pressure, and surface heating rates increasing and velocity slip and temperature jump values decreasing for increasing Re number. A Kelvin-Helmholtz instability arising at the shear layer results in an unsteady flow for the highest Reynolds number. These findings suggest that consideration of experimental measurement times is important when it comes to determining the steady state surface parameters even for a relatively simple double cone geometry at moderately large Reynolds numbers.},

 abstract = {An efficient, new DSMC framework based on AMR/octree unstructured grids is demonstrated for the modeling of near-continuum, strong shocks in hypersonic flows. The code is able to capture the different length scales in such flows through the use of a linearized representation of the unstructured grid using Morton-Z space filling curve for efficient access of collision cells. Strategies were developed to achieve a strong scaling of nearly ideal speed up to 4096 processors and 87% efficiency (weak scaling) for 8192 processors for a strong shock created by flow over a hemisphere. To achieve these very good scalings, algorithms were developed to weight the computational work of a processor by the use of profiled run time data, create maps to optimize processor point-to-point communications, and efficiently generate new DSMC particles every time step. Rigorous thermal non-equilibrium required for modeling high Mach number shocks was achieved through the accurate modeling of collision temperatures on a sampling grid designed to be compatible with the above approaches. The simulation of a nitrogen flow over a double wedge configuration for near-continuum conditions revealed complex hypersonic SWBLIs as well as three-dimensional gas-surface kinetic effects such as velocity and temperature slip. The simulations showed that three-dimensional effects are important in predicting the size of the separation bubble, which in turn, influences gas-surface measurements such as pressure and heat flux.},

 abstract = {Ion thruster plumes interacting with ambient atomic oxygen are simulated using direct simulation Monte Carlo/particle-in-cell code with automatic mesh refinement/octree grids. Because of the disparity among the species concentrations and velocities, particle weighting factors with multiple species weighting time steps have been used. To calculate the elastic cross section for Xe–O collisions, the variable hard sphere collision cross section was compared with the higher-fidelity Lennard–Jones model and found to agree well at the relevant collision energies. Because momentum and charge exchange cross sections for Xe+ and O are not available in the literature, analytic approaches were used to infer these values. The simulations provide a number of interesting results about the role of Xe–O and Xe+ collisions. The effect of incoming freestream atomic oxygen direction on the ion thruster plume at 185 and 300 km altitudes was studied by changing the plume angle with respect to the freestream atomic oxygen, corresponding to satellite orientation change in orbit. It was observed that the freestream atomic oxygen affects the backflux of Xe at the lower altitude. This effect lessens as the altitude increases and is not observable at 300 km, and it was observed that Xe fluxes scale in a linear fashion with the density of O. The spatial distribution of the xenon ion fluxes was not influenced by collisions with freestream atomic oxygen.},

 abstract = {A new computational framework for a coupled PIC-DSMC tool using multiple GPUs to model the kinetic behavior of electrons in plasma plumes is presented in this work. The disparate length scales of the Debye length and the collisional mean free path are resolved by using separate, independent linearized Morton Z-ordered forest of trees. A 2:1 restraint is imposed for the PIC module to solve partial differential equations in the context of an AMR/Octree framework. The MPI-CUDA parallelization strategies used to implement a preconditioned conjugate gradient method for solving the electrostatic Poisson's equation on the 2:1 octree are discussed and the scaling of the code to near ideal speedup as a function of the number of GPUs is demonstrated. The PIC method is validated using analytical test cases, and the octree-based PIC simulations are found to be ten times more efficient compared to the uniform grid method especially for plume simulations which have large density variations. The computational strategies are then demonstrated with the simulation of collisionless, mesothermal plasma plumes using a kinetic approach for both ions and electrons. The effect of ion mass and electron source location are analyzed by comparing plume dynamics and electron velocity distribution functions. It is shown that a more confined mesothermal plume is observed for the heavier xenon ions, present in electric propulsion devices, compared to protons. The confinement of the xenon plume traps the electrons resulting in higher electron temperatures compared to the proton plasma case. In both the simulations, however, the electron temperature is found to be anisotropic. Finally, when a shifted electron source location case is considered the electron velocity distributions in all three directions are found to be unequal and non-Maxwellian, contrary to the co-located case. The ion beam is observed to attract the electrons, which initially oscillate between the radial edges of the ion beam as confirmed by the bi-modal velocity distribution at early times. As the plume evolves, it electrostatically traps these electrons within the ion beam, allowing them to thermalize, as observed from the single-peak electron velocity distribution functions at later times. These results demonstrate that GPUs can efficiently accelerate computations of a fully kinetic approach to enable the study of electron kinetics and neutralization with the highest physical fidelity.},

From our previous work 1 , it was observed that the electric field strengths required to create and sustain a stable Taylor cone are correlated to the internal nanostructure of the propellant ionic liquid. The location of the applied extraction potential with respect to the capillary produces differences in the strength and the shape of the resulting external electric fields. The varying electric fields are strongest at the mouth of the capillary and affect the emission rate, Taylor cone stability, as well as the internal nanostructure of the ionic liquid.

Therefore, an understanding of the plume characteristics, the charge-exchange reactions, and ion energy distribution in the backflow region plays an important role in the design of such thrusters and the location of hollow cathodes. We implement a three dimensional PIC-DSMC approach to model the electric field induced by the charged particles as well as to model the momentum-and the charge-exchange collisions 2 between the neutrals and the ions. To model the plume expansion efficiently, we construct a forest of linearized octrees such that the leaf nodes, analogous to grid cells, satisfy the local mean free path criteria for the DSMC collisions and the local Debye length criteria for the electric field computations. To ensure that the flow-field gradients are captured accurately, a 2:1 balance criteria is imposed where the maximum level difference between a leaf node and its face neighbors is one. The leaf nodes of the forest of trees are finally distributed to multiple GPUs, which iteratively solves the Poisson equation to obtain the electric potential and the electric field. Finally, the charged particles are accelerated by the electric field to generate a new charge distribution and a new potential.},

 abstract = {Unsteadiness of axisymmetric shock-dominated hypersonic laminar separated flow over a double cone is studied for the first time using a combination of time accurate Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) calculations, linear global instability analysis, and momentum potential theory (MPT). Close to steady state linear analysis reveals the spatial structure of the underlying temporally stable global modes. At all Reynolds numbers examined, the amplitude functions demonstrate the strong coupling between the separated flow region at the cone junction with the entire shock system, including pressure and temperature waves generated behind the shock and spatially amplified Kelvin-Helmholtz waves. In addition, as the Reynolds number is increased, temporally damped harmonic shock oscillations and multiple-reflected λ-shock patterns emerge in the eigenfunctions. Application of the MPT (valid for both linear and nonlinear signals) to the highest Reynolds number DSMC results shows that large acoustic and thermal potential variations exist in the vicinity of the separation shock, the λ-shock patterns, and the shear layers. It is further shown that the motion of the bow shock system is highly affected by non-uniformities in the acoustic field. At the highest Reynolds number considered here, the unsteadiness is characterized by Strouhal numbers in the shear layer and bow-shock regions and is found to be in qualitative agreement with earlier experimental and numerical work.},

The obstruction offered by the material and the circuitous flow path is quantified by the Klinkenberg-derived permeability and hydraulic tortuosity factor, which are key material properties that govern the momentum transport through porous media.

Permeability of the microstructure models having porosities of 0.71 and 0.86 is computed in the DSMC simulations and compared to a fibrous TPS material. The rigorous development of a stochastic based thermal response model that can couple convective, conductive, and radiative heat transfer through a porous material having non-uniform thermophysical properties and high temperature gradients is presented and compared with a one-dimensional finite-volume approach.

The octree-based method is found capable of reproducing Coulomb energy in agreement with established and computationally more expensive models, such as the direct Coulomb and the damped shifted force (DSF) method in the absence of an external electric field. In the presence of an external electric field, the octree-based method produces distinctly different results compared to that obtained by the direct Coulomb method. The time required to form Taylor's cone was shorter for the octree method compared to the direct Coulomb approach. While no emission larger than monomers was observed from the direct Coulomb simulation, emission of larger species such as dimers and trimers was observed when the octree-based Coulomb interaction model was used. Furthermore, the octree-based model forms a smaller ion emission cone compared to that from the direct Coulomb method.},

 abstract = {The unsteady behavior of an Edney type-IV shock-dominated hypersonic separated flows over a double-wedge geometry for different gas compositions are studied using the time-accurate direct-simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) and window proper orthogonal decomposition (WPOD) methods. Near steady state, we find that the POD modes can be correlated with the global modes predicted by linear stability theory. The WPOD analyses show that the first mode for each flow quantity outlines the corresponding steady-state solution and that higher spatial POD modes are pronounced in the bow shock, separation, and transmitted shocks and shear layers, thereby coupling these regions. The temporal modes corresponding to each macroscopic flow quantities are observed to have the same decay rates. The effects of three types of gas compositions—molecular nitrogen, nonreacting air consisting of molecular nitrogen and oxygen, and reacting air with oxygen dissociation and the N2 + O exchange reactions—on flow stability are considered. Nonequilibrium thermochemical effects are found to change the shock structures, the size of the separation region, and the time required to reach steady state. The decay rate of the least damped eigenmode for the chemically reacting air case is found to be smaller in comparison to the nonreacting air case since the translational temperatures downstream of the bow shock are lower due to endothermic chemical reactions. The simulated heat fluxes and shock standoff distance are found to be in qualitative agreement with recent experiments where the freestream density is eight times higher than the current DSMC computations.},

 abstract = {Hypersonic separated flows over the so-called “tick” geometry have been studied using the time-accurate direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method and global linear theory. The free stream condition for two experimental cases studied in the free-piston shock tunnel (named T-ADFA) was modeled. These two cases span a Knudsen number from transitional to continuum, a Mach number of about 10, a free stream enthalpy from 10 to 3 MJ/kg, a Reynolds number varying by a factor of four, and a leading edge geometry varied from sharp to one with a bevel of 0.2 mm. For the first time, the time dependence of flow macroparameters on the leading edge nose radius and the Reynolds number are studied using global linear theory. High-fidelity DSMC simulations showed that the temporal behavior of the separation region, which has significant effects on the surface parameters, depends closely on the leading edge bluntness and wall temperature. The formation of a secondary vortex was seen in about 2 ms for the sharp leading edge, whereas in the rounded leading edge geometry, it formed at earlier 0.7 ms. At a steady state, the size and structure of the separation zone, vortex structures, and surface parameters predicted by DSMC were found to be in good agreement with computational fluid dynamics for the higher density case. Finally, linear stability theory showed that for some leading edge shapes and flow densities, the time to reach the steady state was longer than the facility measurement time.},

It was found that at all incidence velocities, the quartz surface was stickier than the HOPG surface. The sticking probabilities and elastic moduli obtained from MD were then used to model surface evolution at a micron length scale using kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations. Rules were derived to control the number of sites available for the process execution in kMC to accurately model erosion of HOPG by atomic oxygen (AO) attack and ice-nucleation on surfaces. It was observed that the effect of defects was to increase the material erosion rate, while that of aggregate nucleation was to lower it. Similarly, simulations were performed to study the effects of AO attack and N<sub>2</sub> adsorption-desorption on surface evolution and it was found that N<sub>2</sub> adsorption-desorption limits the surface available for erosion by AO attack.},

Various Lagrangian submodels are implemented in the code to study the particle phase evolution in the system. Results generated from the newly developed code are compared to the experimental results for the dispersion of glass beads in an electrostatic discharge of energy 2 J performed at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). The simulation results are qualitatively in good agreement with the experimental results. Furthermore, the prominent mechanism of particle lifting was identified to be the Saffman lifting force generated on the particles due to velocity gradients in the gas flow field. Results suggest that the newly developed code is flexible in modeling particle transportation on larger length scales such as flow generated by fireball plasmas.},

This BC prevents the numerical instability, which is typically observed for kinetic simulations that employ the traditional outflow boundary, and thus allows the fully kinetic plume simulations to reach a steady-state with finite computational domain sizes. In addition to modeling a plume with colocated electron–ion sources, the BC is also applied to separated electron–ion sources which model realistic thrusters with a separate external neutralizer configuration without assuming quasi-neutrality. Domain-independence simulations performed with the new open boundary construct showed that the electric field obtained from small and large domain sizes agree within 2%. For the separated electron–ion plume, the minimum domain size required to obtain convergence is such that it must accommodate the plume until the charge density decreases by an order of magnitude. The computational cost of the electrostatic particle-in-cell simulation was found to decrease by a factor of four when the domain size was decreased by one-half.},

The fully kinetic calculations are performed for the first time using the operational thruster exit number densities without geometric scaling and the actual electron-to-ion mass ratio. It was found that kinetic treatment of both electrons and ions significantly affects the self-consistent radial electric field as well as the backflow ion characteristics. For the xenon ion plume with a colocated electron source, increase in the thruster exit number density strengthens the radial electric field which, in turn, increases the energy of the backflow ions by an order of magnitude. In addition, the spanwise variation of the ion flux on the solar panel showed that charge-exchange ions mostly impinge at the tip of the solar panel, furthest from the thruster geometry, for the fully kinetic cases. In comparison, the Boltzmann relation predicts a lower radial electric field for the operational high number density case, resulting in near-normal ion incidence angles in the backflow region causing significant flux closer to the thruster geometry.},

 abstract = {Plasma–surface interactions caused by electric propulsion devices are an important spacecraft aspect of the design that is difficult to measure in ground-based facilities. The negatively biased solar panel surfaces attract the slow-moving charge exchange (CEX) ions generated inside an ion core plume, which can cause surface sputtering on the protective coatings of the solar panels. We use a fully kinetic particle-in-cell direct simulation Monte Carlo (PIC-DSMC) approach that models both electron and ion trajectories to allow us to fully characterize the plasma sheath formed near these surfaces and to understand how the plasma sheath affects the trajectories of CEX ions, their incident energies and angles, and surface sputtering rates. We find that, outside the plasma core, the ion and electron distribution functions are highly non-Maxwellian, and the assumption of electron temperatures is questionable. We introduce a novel floating potential ground boundary condition that enables us to emulate the spacecraft ground for a high range of plasma number densities and surface charging conditions. Finally, we estimate the erosion of the surface using the kinetic results and surface yield empirical relations.},

 abstract = {Low-frequency molecular fluctuations in the translational nonequilibrium zone
of one-dimensional strong shock waves are characterised for the first time in a
kinetic collisional framework in the Mach number range $2\le M\le 10$. Our
analysis draws upon the well-known bimodal nature of the probability density
function (PDF) of gas particles in the shock, as opposed to their Maxwellian
distribution in the freestream, the latter exhibiting an order of magnitude
higher dominant frequencies than the former. Inside the (finite-thickness)
shock region, the strong correlation between perturbations in the bimodal PDF
and fluctuations in the normal stress suggests introducing a novel two-bin
model to describe the reduced-order dynamics of a large number of collision
interactions of gas particles. Our model correctly predicts the
order-of-magnitude difference in fluctuation frequencies in the shock versus
those in the freestream and is consistent with the small-amplitude fluctuations
obtained from the highly resolved Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)
computations of the same configuration. The variation of low-frequency
fluctuations with changes in the conditions upstream of the shock revealed that
these fluctuations can be described by a Strouhal number, based on the bulk
velocity upstream of the shock and the shock-thickness based on the maximum
density-gradient inside the shock, that remains practically independent of Mach
number in the range examined. Our results are expected to have far-reaching
implications for boundary conditions employed in the vicinity of shocks in the
framework of flow instability and laminar-turbulent transition studies of flows

 abstract = {Linear instability of high-speed boundary layers is routinely examined
assuming quiescent edge conditions, without reference to the internal structure
of shocks or to instabilities potentially generated in them. Our recent work
has shown that the kinetically modeled internal nonequilibrium zone of straight
shocks away from solid boundaries exhibits low-frequency molecular
fluctuations. The presence of the dominant low frequencies observed using the
Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method has been explained as a consequence
of the well-known bimodal probability density function (PDF) of the energy of
particles inside a shock. Here, PDFs of particle energies are derived in the
upstream and downstream equilibrium regions, as well as inside shocks, and it
is shown for the first time that they have the form of the non-central
chi-squared (NCCS) distributions. A linear correlation is proposed to relate
the change in the shape of the analytical PDFs as a function of Mach number,
within the range $3 \le M \le 10$, with the DSMC-derived average characteristic
low-frequency of shocks, as computed in our earlier work. At a given Mach
number $M=7.2$, varying the input translational temperature in the range $89
\le T_{tr,1}/(K) \le 1420$, it is shown that the variation in DSMC-derived
low-frequencies is correlated with the change in most-probable-speed inside
shocks at the location of maximum bulk velocity gradient. Using the proposed
linear functions, average low-frequencies are estimated within the examined
ranges of Mach number and input temperature and a semi-empirical relationship
is derived to predict low-frequency oscillations in shocks. Our model can be
used to provide realistic physics-based boundary conditions in receptivity and

 abstract = {During the past years joint efforts have been exerted by different researchers for the development of high speed air vehicles as well as hypersonic systems in general, for a wide range of applications. However, such systems involve rarefied gas flows, which appear to be significantly different comparing to flows at the continuum regime; it is this the reason the Navier-Stokes equations fail to simulate such phenomena without further modification. To this end, the enhancement of an in-house academic Computational Fluid Dynamics solver to encounter such simulations is reported in this study. In case of rarefied gas flows and specifically for flows in the slip regime (Knudsen number greater than 0.01) the no-slip condition on solid wall surfaces is no longer valid; hence, velocity slip and temperature jump boundary conditions have to be used instead. (Short description and some difficulties an SBL code can face). The obtained results are compared with those obtained with the parallel open-source code SPARTA, based on the Direct Simulation Monte-Carlo method. According to this last approach, the flow domain is divided into a finite number of computational cells. The required sample macroscopic flow properties are retrieved assuming inter-molecular collisions of the simulated particles inside such cells. An excellent agreement was achieved between the results obtained by SBL and SPARTA. The effect of wall-slip velocity and temperature distributions on the linear stability of supersonic and hypersonic laminar boundary layers developing on a semi-infinite flat plate is investigated for Knudsen numbers, corresponding to flight altitudes of 35km - 65 km and, at first instance, low Reynolds numbers. The steady laminar base flow is obtained using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. Results on the mean-free-path and wall-normal velocity and temperature gradients obtained are used to construct slip-velocity and temperature-jump boundary conditions along the plate surface, following recent updates of the Maxwell / von Smoluchowski theory. These wall boundary conditions, alongside the pertinent streamwise pressure gradient, extracted from the DSMC simulations at the edge of the boundary layer, are used to obtain similar compressible boundary layer profiles, the linear stability characteristics of which are compared with well-known results delivered by Navier-Stokes methods along a range of altitudes, Mach and Reynolds numbers.},

 abstract = {The main objective of this article is to focus on the aspects of radiation modeling that are special to the hypersonic, thermochemical nonequilibrium environment. This means that the collision rate is sufficiently low that the gas translational - internal temperatures may not be equilibrated for either atomic or molecular systems, the distribution of excited electronic states can be non-Boltzmann, coupling between the flow and radiation may occur, and the ability to treat wide ranges of opacities is required. Two cases are considered: A shock tube and flow over a cylinder. For each case experimental flow data is available from a hypersonic ground test facility. Two chemical sets are used in DSMC to model the flow in each case and emission radiation calculations are done using flow data outputted. The radiation simulations focuses on emission from the first electronically excited state of NO in the Ultraviolet. Excited state population are computed using a Boltzmann distribution and a Quasi Steady State (QSS) chemical model. Synthetic spectra and integrated intensity are computed for the different cases and compared to the experiments. For the expansion and wake region of the cylinder cases, two overlay methods are used to compute excited state population of molecular nitrogen and nitric oxide. Overlay methods including transport terms show higher excited state populations in the wake region compared to the QSS values. Differences in normalized spectra allows to differentiate between several regions in the wake of the cylinder due to differences in rotational and vibrational temperatures.},

Operation in cation mode resulted in yields from 0.5-2.5 emitted electrons per incident ion for emitter voltages of 2.2-3.0 kV. Additionally, the energy of electrons emitted from surfaces bombarded by cations increases linearly with emitter voltage and ranges from 80-165 eV depending on the surface material. A hysteresis effect is identified in the suppression of electron emission during cation bombardment and strongly depends on the target material and emitter voltage. Further, results indicate that 85-95% of the current from electron emission in cation mode travels upstream and is collected by the emitter. Operation in anion mode resulted in much lower yields of < 0.2 emitted electrons per incident ion over the range of 2.2-3.0 kV emitter voltages.

assess the growth rates of unstable modes, the wavelength, location, and origin

 abstract = {Although particle-laden electrostatic discharges are widely used in research as well as in industrial applications, the mechanisms of particle lifting for a particle initially at rest in such highly unsteady flows are not well understood. A multiphase plasma flow is modeled by solving the continuum conservation equations and particles as discrete entities in a Lagrangian approach. The gas phase solver is used to study the generation of shock waves and the high temperature plasma kernel. A one-way coupling approach between the two phases is used and various Lagrangian sub-models are developed to study the particle phase evolution in the system. Comparison with shock tube measurements where a planar shock wave perpendicular to the shock tube wall interacts with particles residing on the wall showed that the predominant mechanism of particle lifting is the Saffman force generated on particles due to velocity gradients in the gas boundary layer. A second configuration with an overhead spherical blast wave generated by an electrostatic discharge (ESD) interacting with a polydisperse distribution of spherical particles placed at three wall-electrode distances was considered. The predicted particle lifting heights and velocities are found to compare well with measurements in an ESD configuration initiated by the dielectric breakdown of ambient air.},

 abstract = {Linear global instability of the three-dimensional (3-D),
spanwise-homogeneous laminar separation bubble (LSB) induced by
shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction (SBLI) in a Mach 7 flow of nitrogen over
a $30^{\circ}-55^{\circ}$ double wedge is studied. At these conditions
corresponding to a freestream unit Reynolds number, $Re_1=5.2\times 10^{4}$
m$^{-1}$, the flow exhibits rarefaction effects and comparable
shock-thicknesses to the size of the boundary-layer at separation. This, in
turn, requires the use of the high-fidelity Direct Simulation Monte Carlo
(DSMC) method to accurately resolve unsteady flow features.
  We show for the first time that the LSB sustains self-excited,
small-amplitude, 3-D perturbations that lead to spanwise-periodic flow
structures not only in and downstream of the separated region, as seen in a
multitude of experiments and numerical simulations, but also in the internal
structure of the separation and detached shock layers. The spanwise-periodicity
length and growth rate of the structures in the two zones are found to be
identical. It is shown that the linear global instability leads to
low-frequency unsteadiness of the triple point formed by the intersection of
separation and detached shocks, corresponding to a Strouhal number of
$St\sim0.02$. Linear superposition of the spanwise-homogeneous base flow and
the leading 3-D flow eigenmode provides further evidence of the strong coupling
between linear instability in the LSB and the shock layer.},

From time-accurate simulations we observed that the plasma sheath had a formation time somewhere between the ion and electron time scales of 17 μs and 30 ps, respectively and electron and ion velocity distribution functions were observed to be highly non-Maxwellian. Comparison of the electron plasma sheath thickness with analytic cylindrical sheath models gave reasonable agreement if the embedded biased interconnect voltage was sufficiently high to cause the dielectric surface to act as a free electron flowing medium. Finally, it was found from the fully kinetic PIC simulations that the fundamental mechanism behind parasitic current is closely related to electron avalanche and the fraction of SEE emitted from different avalanche levels as well as the current collected at the interconnect could be modeled by a power law series for avalanche levels greater than two.},

Since this rate is derived under the assumption of both steady‐state and isobaric/isothermal conditions, the applicability of CNT to highly nonequilibrium environments may be questionable. In addition, the usual strategy of CNT — gas dynamics coupling violates the original nucleation theory even in the isothermal/isobaric environment. In this study, we consider condensation in jets freely expanding into a vacuum. Using the isentropic solution, we approximate the time‐dependent pressure and temperature in a given small volume of a gas that is moving along the jet axis with the flow velocity. Several possible strategies of CNT implementation are considered within this volume. It is shown that the terminal cluster distributions are strongly affected by the steady‐state assumption and that the original CNT rate equations should be integrated into a computational scheme to model the coupled condensation flow.},

 abstract = {A cluster evaporation model was derived from the classical nucleation theory (CNT) in the previous work to simulate condensation in free expanding plumes using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. However, the use of a CNT evaporation model, especially in a low temperature environment, is problematic because macroparameters such as cluster surface tension and vapor saturation pressure are not physically correct for small cluster sizes. In this work, we propose a kinetic based evaporation model obtained from unimolecular dissociation theory (UDT) to model argon cluster evaporation processes in a free expanding plume. The UDT argon cluster evaporation model has been directly verified by molecular dynamics (MD). It is found that although there is about one order of magnitude difference in the CNT and UDT evaporation rates, these two theories predict similar cluster evaporation rate trends as a function of cluster size and temperature. The verified new UDT evaporation model, as well as the previous CNT model, are applied to a free expanding argon condensation plume. The simulation results show that although there are some differences in cluster number density and average cluster size using the CNT and UDT evaporation models, the condensation onset conditions and Rayleigh scattering intensity for both models agree reasonably well with experimental data.},

 abstract = {The two widely used plasma deposition tools for semiconductor processing are Ionized Metal Physical Vapor Deposition (IMPVD) of metals using either planar or hollow cathode magnetrons (HCM), and inductively‐coupled plasma (ICP) deposition of dielectrics in High Density Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition (HDP‐CVD) reactors. In these systems, the injected neutral gas flows are generally in the transonic to supersonic flow regime. The Hybrid Plasma Equipment Model (HPEM) has been developed and is strategically and beneficially applied to the design of these tools and their processes. For the most part, the model uses continuum‐based techniques, and thus, as pressures decrease below 10 mTorr, the continuum approaches in the model become questionable. Modifications have been previously made to the HPEM to significantly improve its accuracy in this pressure regime. In particular, the Ion Monte Carlo Simulation (IMCS) was added, wherein a Monte Carlo simulation is used to obtain ion and neutral velocity distributions in much the same way as in direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC). As a further refinement, this work presents the first steps towards the adaptation of full DSMC calculations to replace part of the flow module within the HPEM. Six species (Ar, Cu, Ar*, Cu*, Ar+, and Cu+) are modeled in DSMC. To couple SMILE as a module to the HPEM, source functions for species, momentum and energy from plasma sources will be provided by the HPEM. The DSMC module will then compute a quasi‐converged flow field that will provide neutral and ion species densities, momenta and temperatures. In this work, the HPEM results for a hollow cathode magnetron (HCM) IMPVD process using the Boltzmann distribution are compared with DSMC results using portions of those HPEM computations as an initial condition.},

The MD/QCT calculations are found to result in lower rate constants and reaction probabilities than the TCE model in the temperature range of 6,000 K and above and also reveal the vibrational favoring feature of the reaction SO2+O→SO+2O. The implementation of both MD/QCT and TCE chemistry reaction models in DSMC is examined through the analysis of the 0‐D time dependant and 2‐D axi‐symmetric DSMC simulations. The difference between the MD/QCT and TCE models is observed in the reaction product contours in the 2‐D problem. The lower rate constant and reaction probability predicted by the MD/QCT model compared to the TCE model creates a smaller reaction region in the 2‐D axi‐symmetric simulation, lower product concentration, and higher temperature. In addition, the reaction region is found to be highly non‐equilibrium, which suggests that MD/QCT is a more suitable model for the simulation of the Io’s atmosphere.},

 abstract = {Io’s sublimation‐driven atmosphere is modeled using the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. These rarefied gas dynamics simulations improve upon earlier models by using a three‐dimensional domain encompassing the entire planet computed in parallel. The effects of plasma impact heating, planetary rotation, and inhomogeneous surface frost are investigated. Circumplanetary flow is predicted to develop from the warm subsolar region toward the colder night‐side. The non‐equilibrium thermal structure of the atmosphere, including vibrational and rotational temperatures, is also presented. Io’s rotation leads to an asymmetric surface temperature distribution which is found to strengthen circumplanetary flow near the dusk terminator. Plasma heating is found to significantly inflate the atmosphere on both day‐ and night‐sides. The plasma energy flux also causes high temperatures at high altitudes but permits relatively cooler temperatures at low altitudes near the dense subsolar point due to plasma energy depletion. To validate the atmospheric model, a radiative transfer model was developed utilizing the backward Monte Carlo method. The model allows the calculation of the atmospheric radiation from emitting/absorbing and scattering gas using an arbitrary scattering law and an arbitrary surface reflectivity. The model calculates the spectra in the ν2 vibrational band of SO2 which are then compared to the observational data.},

Neutral and ionization processes among neutral air species, as well as five ionic species and electrons were considered in the DSMC flowfield modeling using the ion‐averaged velocity model to maintain charge‐neutrality. In CFD, two electron temperature models were compared, and it was found that the degree of ionization (DOI) is sensitive to the electron temperature model. At 80 km, the DOI predicted by DSMC was found to be approximately 3%, but in CFD, the DOI is greater than 20% for the case of Te = Ttr and 9% for the case of Te = Tvib. Therefore, compared to the DSMC solution, the assumption of Te = Tvib is preferable in CFD. Using the Mott‐Smith (M‐S) model, good agreement was obtained between the analytical bimodal distribution functions and DSMC velocity distributions. An effective temperature correction in the relaxation and chemical reaction models using the M‐S model was developed in CFD, and the model reduced the continuum breakdown discrepancy between DSMC and CFD inside the shock in terms of DOI and temperatures. With the M‐S model, the DOI for the case of Te = Tvib in CFD is decreased by approximately 3%.},

 abstract = {Even though the interaction of blast waves with dense particle distributions is ubiquitous in nature and in industry, the underlying physics of the multiphase system evolution is not clearly understood. A canonical multiphase system composed of an embedded monodisperse distribution of spherical particles in a spherical, high-energy gaseous charge is studied numerically using an Eulerian–Lagrangian approach to elucidate the role of non-dilute particle effects on the dynamics of the two-phase flow system. The direct simulation Monte Carlo method is modified to model inelastic particle–particle collisions and to model the gaseous flow inter-leaving through complex structures of monodisperse dense distributions of spherical particles to obtain parameters that are fit to semi-empirical particle cloud drag laws that account for aerodynamic interactions. The study reveals that inter-particle collisions decrease the total particle kinetic energy at early stages of the particle-laden blast wave system evolution, but near-particle interaction increases the particle kinetic energy at this stage. In contrast, at later stages of evolution, collisions tend to retain more kinetic energy, while the aerodynamic interactions tend to dissipate particle kinetic energy.},

 abstract = {Linear instability of high-speed boundary layers is routinely examined assuming quiescent edge conditions, without reference to the internal structure of shocks or to instabilities potentially generated in them. Our recent work has shown that the kinetically modeled internal nonequilibrium zone of straight shocks away from solid boundaries exhibits low-frequency molecular fluctuations. The presence of the dominant low frequencies observed using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method has been explained as a consequence of the well-known bimodal probability density function (PDF) of the energy of particles inside a shock. Here, PDFs of particle energies are derived in the upstream and downstream equilibrium regions, as well as inside shocks, and it is shown for the first time that they have the form of the noncentral Chi-squared (NCCS) distributions. A linear correlation is proposed to relate the change in the shape of the analytical PDFs at a specified upstream number density and temperature as a function of Mach number, within the range 3≤M≤10$$3 \le M \le 10$$, with the DSMC-derived average characteristic low-frequency of shocks, as computed in our earlier work. At a given Mach number M=7.2$$M=7.2$$ and upstream number density n1=1022m-3$$n_1=10^{22}\,\hbox {m}^{-3}$$, it is shown that the variation in DSMC-derived low frequencies is correlated with the change in most-probable-speed inside shocks at the location of maximum bulk velocity gradient for upstream translational temperature in the range ∼90≤Ttr,1/(K)≤1420$$\sim 90 \le T_{tr,1}/(K) \le 1420$$. Using the proposed linear functions, average low frequencies are estimated within the examined ranges of Mach number and input temperature and a semi-empirical relationship is derived to predict low-frequency oscillations in shocks. Our model can be used to provide realistic physics-based boundary conditions in receptivity and linear stability analysis studies of laminar-turbulent transition in high-speed flows.},

 abstract = {Studies related to U gas-phase oxidation through plasma- and thermo-chemistry are important for many fields, including environmental monitoring, forensic analysis, debris analysis in a weapon detonation event, and nucleation physics. Recently, significant efforts have been made to understand the chemical pathways involved in the progression from U atoms to diatoms (UO) and polyatomic molecules (U x O y ), employing optical spectroscopy tools and computational modeling. In many studies, laser ablation of U or a U-containing flow reactor are used as a highly resource-efficient, repeatable, tunable, and lab-scale testbed for studying gas-phase oxidation in U plasmas. The spectroscopic analysis of high-temperature gas-phase oxidation of U is challenging due to the congested U spectra, resolution limitations of instrumentation, and the numerous chemical reaction pathways possible. This article focuses on the current understanding and challenges related to studying U plasma chemistry, specifically U gas-phase oxidation and molecular formation, via optical spectroscopy of plasmas and associated computational and spectral modeling. The physical and chemical processes involved in the evolution from U atoms to U oxide molecules to nanoparticles and agglomerates (i.e., debris) are discussed in the context of optical spectroscopic studies.

 abstract = {Low-frequency molecular fluctuations in the translational nonequilibrium zone of one-dimensional strong shock waves are characterized for the first time in a kinetic collisional framework in the Mach number range 2≤M≤10. Our analysis draws upon the well-known bimodal nature of the probability density function (PDF) of gas particles in the shock, as opposed to their Maxwellian distribution in the freestream, the latter exhibiting two orders of magnitude higher dominant frequencies than the former. Inside the (finite-thickness) shock region, the strong correlation between perturbations in the bimodal PDF and fluctuations in the normal stress suggests introducing a novel two-bin model to describe the reduced-order dynamics of a large number of collision interactions of gas particles. Our model correctly predicts two orders of magnitude differences in fluctuation frequencies in the shock vs those in the freestream and is consistent with the small-amplitude fluctuations obtained from the highly resolved direct simulation Monte Carlo computations of the same configuration. The variation of low-frequency fluctuations with changes in the conditions upstream of the shock revealed that these fluctuations can be described by a Strouhal number, based on the bulk velocity upstream of the shock and the shock-thickness based on the maximum density gradient inside the shock, that remains practically independent of Mach number in the range examined.},

 abstract = {Plasma plume expansion is commonly observed in many applications, such as, ion thruster plumes, astrophysical jets, as well as plasma accelerators. Typically, electrons are treated as a fluid for such simulations, however, in our recent1 kinetic treatment of electrons we have shown that the electron velocity distribution in an expanding plume is anisotropic. In particular, we found that when the electron source is shifted compared to the ion beam, as is observed in realistic ion engine configurations, holes develop in the electron phase-space within 3,000 electron plasma periods, i.e., $3,000\omega_{\text{pe}}\ ^{-1}$. This bi-modal electron velocity distribution is known to trigger a two-stream instability, and affect the ion dynamics. The times-scale over which the ion dynamics2 is affected is typically $40\omega_{\text{pi}}^{-1}$ or $12,000\omega_{\text{pe}}\ ^{-1}$. A major issue in modeling electrons kinetically is that, when electrons exit the domain, a virtual anode is developed, leading to non-physical effects. To work around this problem, the kinetic plasma plume simulations are terminated before the leading-edge of the plume, called the beam-front, crosses the boundary thereby avoiding boundary-effects. However, important physics, such as, ion beam neutralization as well as the effect of bi-modal electron velocity distribution on the ion beam evolution require long simulations times.},

Numerical grid-resolution techniques suitable for capturing strong electric fields in the emitter region were explored, and grid refinement criteria were quantified. The molecular dynamics simulations of the EMIM−BF4 ionic liquid system were modeled to determine the fragmentation mechanism in the presence of an electric field and dimer temperature as well as to provide fragmentation rates for the PIC simulations. An energy analysis of the molecular dynamics (MD) fragmentation demonstrated that the key mechanism for dimer fragmentation corresponds to a decrease in the Coulomb energy between the cation and anion in the system and that dimers of temperatures 300 and 600 K are extremely stable for electric fields smaller than 1.5 V/nm. Using probabilities of fragmentation consistent with the MD simulations, we implemented a dimer fragmentation model in our PIC simulations. The ion energy distribution functions obtained from the PIC simulations were used to predict retarding potential analysis (RPA) curves that were compared directly to measurements. The sensitivity of the RPA shape to the fragmentation probability was found to be significant. By comparing predicted and measured RPA curves for both negative and positive operation modes, and the fact that dimers do not fragment for electric fields less than 0.6 V/nm, we conclude that fragmentation of dimers occurs spontaneously due to their high thermal energies.},

 abstract = {Plasma sheaths control particle and energy transport between the plasma and surface[1]. They can be further complicated when the surface is electron emitting (i.e., thermionic emission). These emissive sheaths are seen in various engineering applications such as RF devices, dusty plasmas, divertors/scrape-off layers, and plasma probes. Recently, emissive sheaths have been hypothesized to promote surface cooling on hypersonic vehicles via thermionically emitted electrons in Hanquist et al.[2], where a space-charge limiting (SCL) sheath assumption was used to predict the electron current exiting the sheath. However, excessive emission from a surface may lead to the formation of an inverse sheath [3], which may further reduce the number of electrons escaping the surface. In recent experimental works by Kraus et al. [3], thermionically emitting filaments (thoriated tungsten) were submersed in Xe plasma flow that produced a space-charge limited (SCL) sheath. We will present a 1D study on sheath formation for an emissive surface that may prevent the emitted electrons from reaching the bulk plasma using the Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method. Prediction of these sheaths is important as they may affect the heat loss and charge flux from the surface[1].},

The main focus of this work was to understand the effect of the amount of molecular oxygen in the free stream flow and different thermochemical models on NO UV emissions. A collisional radiative model was constructed and using this model populations of the electronically excited states are computed to be used in emission spectra calculations. The results showed that as the molecular oxygen mole fraction in the free stream flow changes integrated intensity profiles for the NO emission spectra differ drastically. It was also shown that these integrated intensity profiles are sensitive to the non-equilibrium dissociation modeling and the reaction rate constants used in DSMC simulations. It was concluded that to test the thermochemical models direct comparisons with the flowfields are necessary which can only be done by comparing results with spectral measurements taken at ground test facilities.},

The hypersonic vehicle travels 2750 km before it reaches its destination over a flight time of 21.75 minutes. The aeroheating effects of a conically shaped hypersonic vehicle on the re-entry trajectory is calculated using a semi-empirical model for the surface heat flux. The maximum heat flux value is calculated to be 4 MW/m^2 at the stagnation point. The vehicle surface temperature is coupled with the surface heat flux and has a maximum of 2980 K. Several materials are considered for the hypersonic vehicle and it is shown that those with a high thermal conductivity lead to reductions in the vehicle surface temperature. Comparisons of the empirical model with simulations ran using ANSYS FLUENT{TM} show that the calculated heat flux and vehicle surface temperature agree within +- 30% of the simulated values. The maximum heat flux from the simulations is $4.4$ MW/m^2 which corresponds to a surface temperature maximum of 3047.2 K.},

 abstract = {Linear stability analysis is performed using a combination of two-dimensional direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) (Bird in Molecular gas dynamics and the direct simulation of gas flows, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1994) method for the computation of the basic state and solution of the pertinent eigenvalue problem, as applied to the canonical boundary layer on a semi-infinite flat plate. Three different gases are monitored, namely nitrogen, argon and air, the latter as a mixture of 79% N2$$\mathrm{N}_2$$ and 21% O2$$\mathrm{O}_2$$ at a range of free-stream Mach numbers corresponding to flight at an altitude of ∼55km$$\sim \,55\,\mathrm {km}$$. A neural network has been utilized to predict and smooth the raw DSMC data; the steady laminar profiles obtained are in very good agreement with those computed by (self-similar) boundary layer theory, under isothermal or adiabatic wall conditions, subject to the appropriate slip corrections computed in the DSMC method (Beskok and Karniadakis in Microscale Thermophys Eng 3(1):43–77, 1999; Beskok et al. in J Fluids Eng 118(3):448–456, 1996). The leading eigenmode results pertaining to the unsmoothed DSMC profiles are compared against those of the classic boundary layer theory (Mack in Boundary layer stability theory, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, 1969). Small quantitative, but no significant qualitative differences between the results of the two classes of steady base flows have been found at all parameters examined. The frequencies of the leading eigenmodes at all conditions examined are practically identical, while perturbations corresponding to the DSMC profiles are found to be systematically more damped than their counterparts arising in the boundary layer at the conditions examined, when the correct velocity slip and temperature jump boundary conditions are imposed in the base flow profiles; by contrast, when the classic no-slip boundary conditions are used, less damped/more unstable profiles are obtained, which would lead the flow to earlier transition. On the other hand, the DSMC profiles smoothed by the neural network are marginally more stable than their unsmoothed counterparts. A vortex generator (VG) introduced into the boundary layer downstream of the leading edge and pulsed at rather large momentum coefficient, Cμ=0.27$$C_\mu =0.27$$, and scaled frequency F+≈0.98$$F^+\approx 0.98$$ (Greenblatt and Wygnanski in Prog Aerosp Sci 36:487–545, 2000), is used to generate linear perturbations that decay along the plate, as expected from the low value of the Reynolds number, Reδ=290$$\mathrm{Re}_{\delta }=290$$, in this numerical experiment. The damping rate diminishes monotonically as the VG is placed at successive downstream positions along the plate. The characteristics of the oscillation generated in the boundary layer are predicted accurately by linear stability analysis of the undisturbed profile at the location of VG placement. Most interestingly, the effect of the generated perturbation is felt well outside of the boundary layer, generating oscillations of the leading edge shock that synchronize with linear perturbations inside the boundary layer.},

neutralization of an ion beam's space-charge by electrons emitted by a filament

economical, previous experiments have shown that a variety of waves become
excited in this process that limit the space-charge neutralization. In this
work, the formation and movement of electrostatic solitary waves(ESWs), which

of the beam electrons gives rise to large-sized ESWs that are not predicted by
theory which assumes that the electrons may be described by a Maxwellian
distribution. Our PIC simulations are sufficiently sensitive to be able to
resolve important three-dimensional effects in a 3D cylindrical geometry that
lead to the excitation of Trivelpiece-Gould surface waves due to high-energy

 abstract = {Although the mobility or transport parameters, such as lift drag and pitching moments for regular-shaped particulates, are widely studied, the mobility of irregular fractal-like aggregates generated by the aggregation of monomers is not well understood. These particulates which are ubiquitous in nature, and industries have very different transport mechanisms as compared to their spherical counterpart. A high-fidelity direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) study of two fractal aggregates of different shapes or dimensions is undertaken in the slip and transitional gas regime to understand the underlying mechanism of gas-particle momentum transfer that manifests as the orientation-averaged mobility parameters of the particulates. The study specifically focuses on the viscous contribution of these parameters and develops a non-linear correlation for drag and lift parameters p and q obtained from DSMC by normalizing the axial and lateral forces. The drag parameter p predicted a monotonic increase in fractal particulate drag with respect to a spherical monomer while the lift parameter q shows an initial increasing trend but a decreasing tendency toward the high Mach number or high compressibility regime. The approximate model that captures the compressibility and rarefaction effects of the fractal mobility is used to study the evolution of these particulates in a canonical Rankine vortex to illustrate the wide disparity in the trajectories of the fractal aggregate vs a spherical geometry approximation generally found in the literature.},

 abstract = { Linear three-dimensional instability is studied in the shock layer and the laminar separation bubble (LSB) induced by shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions in a Mach 7 flow of nitrogen over a double wedge with a    $30^{\circ }\text {--}55^{\circ }$   cross-sectional profile. At a free-stream unit Reynolds number    $Re=5.2\times 10^{4}\,{\rm m}^{-1}$   this flow exhibits rarefaction effects and has shock thicknesses comparable to the thickness of the boundary layer at separation. Flow features have been fully resolved using a high-fidelity massively parallel implementation of the direct simulation Monte Carlo method that captures the flow evolution from the inception of three-dimensionality, through linear growth of instabilities, to the early stages of nonlinear saturation. It is shown that the LSB sustains self-excited, small-amplitude perturbations that originate past the primary separation line and lead to spanwise-periodic wall striations inside the bubble and downstream of the primary reattachment line, as known from earlier experiments, simulations and instability analyses. A spanwise-periodic instability, synchronised with that in the separation zone, is identified herein for the first time, which exists in the internal structure of the separation and detached shock layers, and manifests itself as spanwise-periodic cats-eyes patterns in the global mode amplitude functions. The growth rate and the spanwise-periodicity length of linear disturbances in the shock layers and the LSB are found to be identical. Linear amplification of the most unstable three-dimensional flow perturbations leads to synchronised low-frequency unsteadiness of the triple point, with a Strouhal number of    $St\approx 0.028$   . },

Linear stability analysis performed confrms this conjecture, yielding a globally stable solution for a wide range of spanwise wavenumbers. The two-dimensional (spanwise wavenumber beta = 0) limit is found to be the least stable, an increase of beta leading to more stable spectra while retaining the same leading stationary mode. Higher scaled ramp angles, leading to substantially higher recirculation levels, are currently being analyzed.},

 abstract = {Experiments were conducted at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign Electric Propulsion Laboratory to study the ion-induced secondary charge emission from surfaces bombarded by an [Emim][BF4] electrospray plume. The surfaces were unpolished and had oxide and hydrocarbon layers typical of as-received materials used in electrospray experiments. The effect of changing the bias from −85 to +85 V on the target collecting current from the electrospray plume was measured. These data are used to calculate the yield of positive and negative charged species emission from the target due to bombarding cations and anions. The yields of positive charges per incident cation (γcation+), negative charges per incident cation (γcation−), positive charges per incident anion (γanion+), and negative charges per incident anion (γanion−) are measured for eight different industrial materials commonly used in electrospray diagnostics or thruster and spacecraft construction. These yields range from 0 to 1.3 charges per incident ion over a range of emitter voltages from 1.5 to 2.9 kV and largely display linearly increasing trends with increasing emitter voltage. Over this emitter voltage range, γcation+ ranges from 0 to 0.55, γcation− ranges from 0 to 0.75, γanion+ ranges from 0 to 0.4, and γanion− ranges from 0.3 to 1.3. The data show for the first time positive and negative charges being emitted due to both cation and anion bombardment and suggest that secondary ions sputtered from the surface are important to the secondary charge emission behavior in electrospray plumes.},

 abstract = {The present study investigates the thermionically emitting surfaces immersed in flowing plasmas by using an electrostatic Particle-in-cell (PIC) code, CHAOS [1], which is an efficient GPU-based solver developed at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The nature of emissive sheaths submersed in low density (~1014 m-3) and high density (~1016 m-3) plasmas is examined by performing 1-D collisionless simulations. In this work, we will show that, in both cases, there is a virtual cathode formation near the emitting surface where an electron cloud accumulates and a space-charge-limiting (SCL) sheath forms. The SCL sheath is about 10 Debye lengths in thickness with a 16 Debye lengths thick quasi-neutral, and 8 Debye lengths thick inlet-sheath region. Since the electrons are emitted with a surface temperature of 0.17 eV, a voltage drop of the same order is found for the virtual cathode. We validate our PIC simulations by comparing the SCL currents with the estimates from Child-Langmuir Law [2] and an improved sheath theory developed by Hanquist et al [3]. We plan to show how variables of emissive surface temperature and plasma density affect the SCL current with application to electron-transpiration-cooling over hypersonic surfaces.},

 abstract = {Ion beams are used in various engineering applications such as particle accelerators, ion-thrusters, and ion-implantations. The electrons are introduced to neutralize the beam and reduce their divergence along the axis. This is most economically achieved by introducing electrons via an external filament source. However, in recent numerical works by Lan et al.[1], [2], electrostatic-solitary-waves (ESWs) were observed for such a setup in a 2D ion beam where the ESWs slowed the beam neutralization process [2]. We present a Particle-in-Cell [3] study of the beam neutralization in both 2D and 3D beams and show the formation of ESWs and their movement along the beam axis. Further, by performing theoretical analysis, we will show the uniqueness of these ESWs found in ion beams where a non-Maxwellian electron distribution allows for ESWs of large lengths to form. We will also present our findings on the long-wavelength cylindrical surface waves [4] found in our 3D simulations and report the change in their properties with the beam radii. The prediction of surface waves and their frequencies is vital in experimental diagnostics and passive measurements in plasma beams [5].},

 abstract = {Hypersonic flow over a cylinder was modeled using the direct simulation Monte Carlo method to study how nitric oxide (NO) Ultraviolet emission profiles are a test of high-fidelity thermochemical, nonequilibrium models. For pressures found in typical hypersonic ground facilities, it was shown that the ultraviolet radiation emission profiles are very close to those calculated by assuming Boltzmann equilibrium conditions. Therefore, the NO emission profiles can be tied directly to the ground state NO concentration and flow bulk temperature. Two chemical models differing in the manner in which molecular oxygen is dissociated were considered in this classic canonical-type flow. A comparison of the predicted flowfields with schlieren imagery and surface pressure measurements from previous experiments showed good agreement; however, the sensitivity of these measurements to change in different freestream species concentrations was not found to be strong. Instead, the shapes of the predicted NO integrated emission spatial profiles were observed to be highly sensitive to whether vibrational favoring was considered in the oxygen dissociation model for the same freestream conditions.},

 abstract = {A pulse of electron timescale applied to a planar electrode immersed in a homogeneous plasma in a multipole plasma chamber (MPC) is modeled using a fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) approach. In the time-explicit PIC simulations, we observed that the ion-sheath expansion is accompanied by electron timescale harmonic plasma oscillations at the sheath edge that decay after applying the pulse. First, we validate our PIC approach by comparing it with previous analytical and semi-empirical sheath expansion studies. Then, we compare our PIC results with experiments conducted in the MPC where similar electron frequency oscillations were excited when an electron timescale pulse was applied to a flat-conductor plate. In both PIC simulations and experiments, we find that the shape of the applied pulse dictates the amplitude of the sheath edge oscillations. In the PIC simulations, we observe that Landau damping has no discernible effect on these oscillations. However, in the experiments, the presence of a hot electron population results in a higher damping of electron oscillations. In both PIC simulations and experiments, the amplitude of the electron frequency oscillations decreases with the applied pulse width and these oscillations disappear for a linear pulse of a longer timescale of tpulse=1 μs (ωpetpulse=178), in the PIC simulations.},

We show that such electrostatic waves become excited in both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) beams with different shapes and sizes. Through a 1D Bernstein–Greene–Kruskal (BGK) analysis of the 2D beam, we find that the non-Maxwellian nature of the beam electrons gives rise to large-sized ESWs that are not predicted by BGK theory since it assumes a Maxwellian electron velocity distribution in the beam. Finally, we show that a 1D BGK theory is inadequate to describe ESWs in 3D beams because of complex electron trajectories.},

Our work reveals that the high-energy electrons excite Trivelpiece–Gould (TG) surface waves in the beams with 3D axisymmetric geometries. These high-energy electrons are generated because of a large amplitude electrostatic solitary wave (ESW) that forms near the electron source and has an electric potential amplitude more than three times the electron thermal energy. We also find that surface wave excitation only happens when the beam radius is large enough at the ion source to attract enough electrons that could form the large amplitude ESW. A comparison of the 3D TG surface wave dispersion relation with an expression for 2D surface waves reveals that they become excited in 3D axisymmetric but not in 2D planar beam because of a higher phase speed requirement in the latter case.},

 abstract = {Although particle–laden electrostatic discharges are widely used in laboratories as well as in industrial applications, the mechanism of particle lifting for particles initially at rest in such highly unsteady systems is not well understood. A multiphase gas–particle solver is developed using the multiphase particle-in-cell (MP-PIC) approach to emulate the interaction of a compressible shock-dominated gas phase with the dense particle phase. First, the two-way coupled solver is initially used to study the interaction of a planar traveling shock with a vertical curtain of particulates. The gas and particle phase evolution was found to be in good agreement with a similar experimental study in Ling et al. [Phys. Fluids 24, 113301 (2012)]. Second, the MP-PIC code is used to study the interaction of an expanding blast wave with a thick bed of particles. The simulation considered forces such as quasi-steady drag, pressure-gradient, added-mass, Saffman, and Magnus forces. We observe that the vertical liftoff particles close to the shock impingement point in this configuration are associated with the quasi-steady drag, pressure gradient, and added-mass forces. Also, the Saffman lift and Magnus forces contribute to lifting particles located radially farther away from the shock impingement point. In addition, the study finds a decrease in particle lifting efficiency with decreasing plasma kernel length and shock strength.},

The interactions between these multiscale structures are shown to be well captured with the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, which is a particle-kinetic approach. This computational technique was used because even though the freestream conditions were continuumlike, sufficiently strong gradients in the shock and jet expansion were observed to cause continuum breakdown. The time-accurate DSMC approach has been shown in previous work to capture the multiscale structures and unsteadiness in the shock structure that occurs in such flows, as was also observed in this work. These sources of unsteadiness in the shock system are shown to locally affect surface parameters, such as heat transfer and skin friction, as well as predict a low–frequency unsteadiness consistent with earlier values in the literature.},

 abstract = {In the study of gas-particulate multiphase systems, the flow of high-speed gas through a distribution of solid particulates is of utmost importance. While these aerodynamically interacting systems have been extensively studied for low-speed gas flows in the gas continuum regime, less attention has been given to high-speed systems where non-continuum effects are significant due to the high flow gradients. To address this, the flow of rarefied gas through an aerodynamically interacting monodisperse spherical particle system is studied using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) gas-kinetic approach. Since the method provides the best resolution of shocks at supersonic Mach numbers it is used to classify the weak separated shocks and strong collective shocks in these systems based on particle spacing in a two-particulate system at different orientation angles. The study used the two-particle system to help analyze more complex particle distributions of volume fractions, 1%, 5%, and 15%, exposed to gas flows in the slip and transitional gas regime for a free-stream Mach number range of 0 . 2 < M a ∞ < 2 . 0 . We observe that the weak separated shocks in the 1% distribution allow a higher degree of gas penetration and shock-particle interactions or “hypersonic-surfing”, exposing a major fraction of the particulates to higher force magnitudes. In contrast, the strong collective shock in the 5% and 15% distributions only generates high particulate forces on the flow-facing particles. Finally, a simple stochastic model is proposed for use in large-scale Eulerian–Lagrangian simulations that captures the non-monotonic behavior of average drag and force variability generated by the complicated gas particulate interactions in the compressible gas regime.},

 abstract = {The erosion and cratering of solid particles to the surface of high-speed vehicles could significantly shorten the lifetime of the engine and damage the structures, yet the physics of the particle-laden high-speed flow is not clearly understood. In the present study, we employed a Direct simulation Monte Carlo approach to obtain a high-speed flow over a double-cone at a Mach number of about 15.8 and unit gas Reynolds numbers of 4.114 × 105m−1. A one-way coupled Lagrangian particle methodology was established based on the obtained flow field to examine the dynamics of solid particles in the shock-dominated, recirculating double-cone flow and assess the surface impact due to the existence of various sizes of particles. The results showed that the first cone suffered an intense particle impact over a broader range of particle sizes than the second cone.},

 abstract = {Two new applications of high performance computing based on the DSMC approach were presented in the Graeme Bird Plenary Lecture and are summarized in this paper. The paper first discusses the importance of bimodality in the velocity distribution function in characterizing unsteady shock oscillations as well as their role in understanding transitioning laminar shock-boundary layer flows. A second computational problem of the neutralization of a low-temperature ion beam plasma using the particle-in-cell approach is discussed and again the non-Maxwellian behavior of plasma electrons is shown to change the behavior of unsteady electron solitary waves. The paper looks both back and forwards in time and provides some assessment of the fundamental role of particle kinetic approaches in nonequilibrium gas dynamics.},

 abstract = {This work investigates the influence of slip boundary conditions on modal stability analysis of compressible Couette flow at two distinct Mach numbers. Slip boundary conditions are extracted directly from kinetic gas theory, using Direct Simulation Monte Carlo, and are applied to the ordinary differential equations governing compressible Couette flow. Modal stability analysis shows only qualitative differences between least stable eigensolutions for the respective cases with and without slip boundary conditions. This is in good agreement with findings of a similar study conducted for hypersonic boundary layers by Klothakis et al. (Theoretical and Computational Fluid Dynamics 36, 117–139, 2022).},

 abstract = {Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) was utilized to calculate hypersonic flow over an isolated roughness element. Two separate data-driven methods were employed to identify the least-stable global flow eigenmode downstream of the roughness element, revealing a connection between oscillations present in the shock layer, detached shear layer, and vortical structures behind the roughness. Furthermore, significant oscillations were observed in the cross-flow velocity component of the eigenmode. The analysis also demonstrated the impact of the shock layer on the least stable eigenmode of the flow.},

 abstract = {A hypersonic flow at M=16 over a double cone geometry was simulated using Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method. The simulation was done using a fully three dimensional setting and the results were compared with the corresponding axisymmetric simulations at the same conditions. It was observed that the well-defined closed separation bubble in the axisymmetric simulations does not exist for the three dimensional simulations. Breaking of axial symmetry in the separation bubble and shear and shock layers surrounding the separation bubble was shown with periodic structures appearing in these layers. Further analysis is being conducted for the origins of these instabilities using linear stability theory.},

@article{pub.1171599677,
 abstract = {Linear stability of supersonic flow over a short compression corner with ramp
angles 30 and 42 is investigated using Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) and
Linear Stability Theory (LST) at Mach number 3, Reynolds number 11,200 and low
Knudsen number, O(10$^{-4}$). The two-dimensional base flows feature nonzero
velocity slip and temperature jump and were found to be steady and laminar at
both ramp angles. Modal analysis revealed a previously unknown traveling
three-dimensional global mode, the amplitude functions of which peak at the
leading-edge and separation shocks and extend within the shear layer of the
large laminar separation bubble formed on the short compression corner. This
mode is linearly unstable at the higher ramp angle and stable at the lower one,
while the known stationary three-dimensional global mode which peaks at the
laminar separation is also present in the spectrum, but is (strongly) damped at
both ramp angles. Three-dimensional DSMC simulations have fully confirmed the
LST results, underlined (again) the significance of modeling the shock
contribution in linear stability analyses of high-speed flow, and predicted the
nonlinear evolution of the flow up to the generation of lambda vortices on the
ramp, for the first time in the context of kinetic theory simulations.},
