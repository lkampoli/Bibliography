 abstract = {A novel combined Event-Driven/Time-Driven (ED/TD) algorithm to speed-up the Molecular Dynamics simulation of rarefied gases using realistic spherically symmetric soft potentials is presented. Due to the low density regime, the proposed method correctly identifies the time that must elapse before the next interaction occurs, similarly to Event-Driven Molecular Dynamics. However, each interaction is treated using Time-Driven Molecular Dynamics, thereby integrating Newton’s Second Law using the sufficiently small time step needed to correctly resolve the atomic motion. Although infrequent, many-body interactions are also accounted for with a small approximation. The combined ED/TD method is shown to correctly reproduce translational relaxation in argon, described using the Lennard-Jones potential. For densities between ρ=10-4kg/m3 and ρ=10-1kg/m3, comparisons with kinetic theory, Direct Simulation Monte Carlo, and pure Time-Driven Molecular Dynamics demonstrate that the ED/TD algorithm correctly reproduces the proper collision rates and the evolution toward thermal equilibrium. Finally, the combined ED/TD algorithm is applied to the simulation of a Mach 9 shock wave in rarefied argon. Density and temperature profiles as well as molecular velocity distributions accurately match DSMC results, and the shock thickness is within the experimental uncertainty. For the problems considered, the ED/TD algorithm ranged from several hundred to several thousand times faster than conventional Time-Driven MD. Moreover, the force calculation to integrate the molecular trajectories is found to contribute a negligible amount to the overall ED/TD simulation time. Therefore, this method could pave the way for the application of much more refined and expensive interatomic potentials, either classical or first-principles, to Molecular Dynamics simulations of shock waves in rarefied gases, involving vibrational nonequilibrium and chemical reactivity.},

 abstract = {A hybrid numerical scheme designed for hypersonic non-equilibrium flows is presented which solves the Navier–Stokes equations in regions of near-equilibrium and uses the direct simulation Monte Carlo method where the flow is in non-equilibrium. Detailed analysis of each stage of the hybrid cycle illustrates the difficulty in defining physically correct DSMC boundary conditions in regards to both macroscopic state and velocity distribution. However, results also show that DSMC boundary conditions have little effect on a previously initialized interior particle domain. A sub-relaxation technique capable of determining macroscopic, hydrodynamic properties in a DSMC simulation is used to determine low-scatter boundary conditions for the NS domain. Particle and continuum domains adapt during the hybrid simulation through application of a continuum breakdown parameter based on the gradient-length Knudsen number. The hybrid code reproduces experimental results and full DSMC simulations in half the time for a large range of 1D shock waves in argon and diatomic nitrogen gas.},

 abstract = {Robust cut-cell algorithms are detailed for general multi-level Cartesian grid direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) implementations. Different approaches for each component of the cut-cell algorithms are elaborated and compared, based on time efficiency, robustness, and ease of implementation. Special situations that arise in sorting the surface triangles, calculating the cut-cell volume, and identifying multiple cut-volumes contained in a single Cartesian cell, are handled by the algorithms, and their effects on the overall simulation results are analyzed using test cases. Three-dimensional DSMC simulations are conducted for a Mach number 20.2 N2 gas flowing over a Planetary Probe geometry showing good agreement with experimental heat flux measurements. Rarefied flow over a geometry resembling the MIR Space Station is also conducted, to demonstrate the ability of the proposed cut-cell algorithms to handle complex geometries. The time required to cut the surface meshes from the background Cartesian grids and to calculate the volume of the resulting cut-cells is found to be comparable to the time cost for one DSMC simulation time step for cases considered.},

 abstract = {In this work we outline a Classical Trajectory Calculation Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (CTC-DSMC) implementation that uses the no-time-counter scheme with a cross-section determined by the interatomic potential energy surface (PES). CTC-DSMC solutions for translational and rotational relaxation in one-dimensional shock waves are compared directly to pure Molecular Dynamics simulations employing an identical PES, where exact agreement is demonstrated for all cases. For the flows considered, long-lived collisions occur within the simulations and their implications for multi-body collisions as well as algorithm implications for the CTC-DSMC method are discussed. A parallelization technique for CTC-DSMC simulations using a heterogeneous multicore CPU/GPU system is demonstrated. Our approach shows good scaling as long as a sufficiently large number of collisions are calculated simultaneously per GPU (∼100,000) at each DSMC iteration. We achieve a maximum speedup of 140× on a 4 GPU/CPU system vs. the performance on one CPU core in serial for a diatomic nitrogen shock. The parallelization approach presented here significantly reduces the cost of CTC-DSMC simulations and has the potential to scale to large CPU/GPU clusters, which could enable future application to 3D flows in strong thermochemical nonequilibrium.},

 abstract = {The direct simulation Monte Carlo method (DSMC) has evolved over 50 years into a powerful numerical technique for the computation of thermochemical nonequilibrium gas flows. In this context, nonequilibrium means that velocity and internal energy distribution functions are not in equilibrium forms due to a low number of intermolecular collisions within a fluid element. In hypersonic flow, nonequilibrium conditions occur at high altitude and in regions of flow fields with small length scales. This article highlights significant developments in particle simulation methods (since 2001) applied specifically to hypersonic flows, which now includes Molecular Dynamics in addition to DSMC. Experimental measurements that have led directly to improved DSMC models will be highlighted. Algorithm development for DSMC aimed at increasing computational efficiency is discussed with a focus on hybrid particle-continuum methods. New research that applies all-atom Molecular Dynamics simulation and trajectory-based DSMC simulation to normal shock waves is summarized. Finally, a discussion of state-resolved DSMC modeling is included with reference to future prospects for particle simulation methods and in particular for the DSMC method.},

@article{pub.1023373505,
 abstract = {This article contains an atomic-level numerical investigation of rovibrational relaxation in molecular nitrogen at high temperature (>4000 K), neglecting dissociation. We conduct our study with the use of pure Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Classical Trajectory Calculations (CTC) Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), verified to produce statistically identical results at the conditions of interest here. MD and CTC DSMC solely rely on the specification of a potential energy surface: in this work, the site-site Ling-Rigby potential. Additionally, dissociation is prevented by modeling the N–N bond either as a harmonic or an anharmonic spring. The selected molecular model was shown to (i) recover the shear viscosity (obtained from equilibrium pure MD Green-Kubo calculations) of molecular nitrogen over a wide range of temperatures, up to dissociation; (ii) predict well the near-equilibrium rotational relaxation behavior of N2; (iii) reproduce vibrational relaxation times in excellent accordance with the Millikan-White correlation and previous semi-classical trajectory calculations in the low temperature range, i.e., between 4000 K and 10 000 K. By simulating isothermal relaxations in a periodic box, we found that the traditional two-temperature model assumptions become invalid at high temperatures (>10 000 K), due to a significant coupling between rotational and vibrational modes for bound states. This led us to add a modification to both the Jeans and the Landau-Teller equations to include a coupling term, essentially described by an additional relaxation time for internal energy equilibration. The degree of anharmonicity of the N2 bond determines the strength of the rovibrational coupling. Although neglecting N2 dissociation only provides a partial description of a nitrogen system at very high temperatures, high-energy trends for bound-bound transitions are essential to understand nonequilibrium gas flows, with possible implications on rovibration/chemistry interaction at the onset of N2 dissociation.},

@article{pub.1036040533,
 abstract = {A new rotational energy exchange model for direct simulation Monte Carlo and multi-temperature Navier–Stokes methods is presented. The direct simulation Monte Carlo model is based only on collision quantities and reduces to a rotational collision number in the continuum limit, applicable for use with the Jeans relaxation equation. The model is formulated based on recent molecular dynamics simulations of rotational relaxation in nitrogen (Valentini et al., Physics of Fluids, Vol. 24, No. 10, 2012, p. 106101) and accounts for the dependence of the relaxation rate on the direction to the equilibrium state. This enables a single parameterization of the model to accurately simulate rotational relaxation in both compressing and expanding flows, unlike the widely used Parker model. The direct simulation Monte Carlo model is simple to implement, numerically efficient, and accurately reproduces a range of pure molecular dynamics solutions, including isothermal relaxations, normal shock waves, and expansions. A general form for the energy distribution function that should be sampled for post-collision states (using the Borgnakke–Larsen approach) is presented. This general formulation ensures detailed balance and equipartition of energy at equilibrium for any collision-quantity-based direct simulation Monte Carlo model and also explains the behavior of prior rotational models in the literature. The model formulation is also general to the inelastic collision selection procedure used, which is shown to be a crucial aspect in implementing a direct simulation Monte Carlo collision model. Finally, the increased accuracy of a collision-quantity-based model compared with a cell-averaged model is demonstrated by comparing rotational energy distribution functions within a shock wave against pure molecular dynamics solutions.},

@article{pub.1036177634,
 abstract = {Atomic-level Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations equipped with a reactive force field (ReaxFF) are used to study atomic oxygen adsorption on a Pt(111) surface. The off-lattice GCMC calculations presented here rely solely on the interatomic potential and do not necessitate the pre-computation of surface adlayer structures and their interpolation. As such, they provide a predictive description of adsorbate phases. In this study, validation is obtained with experimental evidence (steric heats of adsorption and isotherms) as well as DFT-based state diagrams available in the literature. The ReaxFF computed steric heats of adsorption agree well with experimental data, and this study clearly shows that indirect dissociative adsorption of O2 on Pt(111) is an activated process at non-zero coverages, with an activation energy that monotonically increases with coverage. At a coverage of 0.25ML, a highly ordered p(2×2) adlayer is found, in agreement with several low-energy electron diffraction observations. Isotherms obtained from the GCMC simulations compare qualitatively and quantitatively well with previous DFT-based state diagrams, but are in disagreement with the experimental data sets available. ReaxFF GCMC simulations at very high coverages show that O atoms prefer to bind in fcc hollow sites, at least up to 0.8ML considered in the present work. At moderate coverages, little to no disorder appears in the Pt lattice. At high coverages, some Pt atoms markedly protrude out of the surface plane. This observation is in qualitative agreement with recent STM images of an oxygen covered Pt surface. The use of the GCMC technique based on a transferable potential is particularly valuable to produce more realistic systems (adsorbent and adsorbate) to be used in subsequent dynamical simulations (Molecular Dynamics) to address recombination reactions (via either Eley–Rideal or Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanisms) on variously covered surfaces. By using GCMC and Molecular Dynamics simulations, the ReaxFF force field can be a valuable tool for understanding heterogeneous catalysis on a solid surface. Finally, the use of a reactive potential is a necessary requirement to investigate problems where dissociative adsorption occurs, as typical of many important catalytic processes.},

 abstract = {Molecular simulations with a resolved surface microstructure were performed for high-temperature dissociated oxygen reacting with a carbon–carbon composite material. The direct simulation Monte Carlo method was used to simulate the convection and diffusion of reactants toward the microstructure and the transport of surface reaction products away from the microstructure. Simulations were performed with and without gas-phase chemical reactions to determine the relative importance of gas–surface reactions compared to gas-phase reactions next to the material surface. The simulations incorporated reaction probabilities for individual gas–surface collisions based on new reactive scattering data obtained from molecular beam experiments. The experiments provide detailed dynamical data on the scattering of O, O2, CO, and CO2 from a representative material sample, made of vitreous carbon. These experiments indicate that a majority of surface reaction products were produced through thermal mechanisms. For a gas–surface temperature of 800 K, it was found that despite CO being the dominant surface reaction product, a gas-phase reaction forms significant CO2 within the microstructure region. The amount of CO2 production within the microstructure region was shown to be dependent on the local Knudsen number, based on the exposed microstructure height. Finally, preliminary simulations were performed for a real carbon–carbon surface. The surface topography is obtained through x-ray microtomography of an ablated carbon–carbon sample, which is triangulated and used directly within a direct simulation Monte Carlo simulation of the gas–surface interaction.},

@article{pub.1045421834,
 abstract = {Parallel implementation of a three-dimensional direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) code employing complex data structures and dynamic memory allocation is detailed for shared memory systems using Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP). Several techniques to optimize the serial implementation of the DSMC method are first discussed. Specifically for a 3-level Cartesian grid, a Cartesian-based movement technique including particle indexing is demonstrated to result in a modest decrease in overall simulation expense of 34% compared with a ray-tracing technique combined with stored cell-connectivity. Two strategies for data localization leading to optimal usage of cache memory are demonstrated to speed up certain cell-based functions (such as collision computations) by a factor of 3.38–4.36. The shared-memory parallel implementation using OpenMP is then described in detail. Synchronization points and related critical sections are identified as major factors that impact the OpenMP parallel performance. Techniques to remove all such synchronization points in the OpenMP implementation of the DSMC method are outlined. For dual-core and quad-core systems, speedups of 1.99 and 3.74, respectively, are obtained for a (free-stream flow) test simulation with low granularity. Finally, the parallel performance of identical source code employing OpenMP is shown to be strongly correlated to the underlying computer architecture. Both Symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP) and non-uniform memory access (NUMA) systems are studied in order to achieve a better understanding of their impacts on parallel scalability when using OpenMP.},

The molecular dynamics simulations are first validated against experimental data. Good agreement is found between the molecular dynamics solutions and the experimental measurements, with the exception of the parallel temperature profile in the 24.7% Ar-He mixture, despite the satisfactory agreement between the parallel velocity profiles. Secondly, a validation against direct simulation Monte Carlo solutions obtained with the accurate generalized hard sphere model is presented. As expected, the generalized hard sphere direct simulation Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics solutions are in near-perfect agreement. Finally, molecular dynamics results are compared to those obtained with the lower fidelity variable hard sphere model, which, if inappropriately parametrized, fails to describe the shock wave structure. This work exemplifies how full molecular dynamics solutions could be used to precisely discern differences between phenomenological models of various accuracy.},

@article{pub.1048667456,
 abstract = {The friction factor of an aerosol particle depends upon the Knudsen number (Kn), as gas molecule–particle momentum transfer occurs in the transition regime. For spheres, the friction factor can be calculated using the Stokes–Millikan equation (with the slip correction factor). However, a suitable friction factor relationship remains sought-after for nonspherical particles. We use direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) to evaluate an algebraic expression for the transition regime friction factor that is intended for application to arbitrarily shaped particles. The tested friction factor expression is derived from dimensional analysis and is analogous to Dahneke's adjusted sphere expression. In applying this expression to nonspherical objects, we argue for the use of two previously developed drag approximations in the continuum (Kn → 0) and free molecular (Kn → ∞) regimes: the Hubbard–Douglas approximation and the projected area (PA) approximation, respectively. These approximations lead to two calculable geometric parameters for any particle: the Smoluchowski radius, R S, and the projected area, PA. Dimensional analysis reveals that Kn should be calculated with PA/πR S as the normalizing length scale, and with Kn defined in this manner, traditional relationships for the slip correction factor should apply for arbitrarily shaped particles. Furthermore, with this expression, Kn-dependent parameters, such as the dynamic shape factor, are readily calculable for nonspherical objects. DSMC calculations of the orientationally averaged drag on spheres and test aggregates (dimers, and open and dense 20-mers) in the range Kn = 0.05–10 provide strong support for the proposed method for friction factor calculation in the transition regime. Experimental measurements of the drag on aggregates composed of 2–5 primary particles further agree well with DSMC results, with differences of less than 10% typically between theoretical predictions, numerical calculations, and experimental measurements.

 abstract = { An analytical correlation is developed for stagnation-point heat flux on spherical objects travelling at high velocity which is accurate for conditions ranging from the continuum to the free-molecular flow regime. Theoretical analysis of the Burnett and super-Burnett equations is performed using simplifications from shock-wave and boundary-layer theory to determine the relative contribution of higher-order heat flux terms compared with the Fourier heat flux (assumed in the Navier–Stokes equations). A rarefaction parameter (    $W_{r}\equiv M_{\infty }^{2{\it\omega}}/Re_{\infty }$   ), based on the free-stream Mach number (    $M_{\infty }$   ), the Reynolds number (    $Re_{\infty }$   ) and the viscosity–temperature index (    ${\it\omega}$   ), is identified as a better correlating parameter than the Knudsen number in the transition regime. By studying both the Burnett and super-Burnett equations, a general form for the entire series of higher-order heat flux contributions is obtained. The resulting heat flux expression includes terms with dependence on gas properties, stagnation to wall-temperature ratio and a main dependence on powers of the rarefaction parameter    $W_{r}$   . The expression is applied as a correction to the Fourier heat flux and therefore can be combined with any continuum-based correlation of choice. In the free-molecular limit, a bridging function is used to ensure consistency with well-established free-molecular flow theory. The correlation is then fitted to direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) solutions for stagnation-point heat flux in high-speed nitrogen flows. The correlation is shown to accurately capture the variation in heat flux predicted by the DSMC method in the transition flow regime, while limiting to both continuum and free-molecular values. },

Here, we employ quantum mechanical electronic structure calculations to study an uncoordinated silicon defect, a non-bridging oxygen defect, and a peroxyl defect on the reconstructed (0001) surface of α-quartz. We characterized the spin states and energies of the defects, and calculated the reaction profiles for atomic oxygen recombination at the defects. We elucidated the diradical character by analyzing the low-lying excited states using multireference wave function methods. We show that the diradical defects consist of weakly coupled doublet radicals, and the atomic oxygen recombination can take place through a barrierless process at defects. We have delineated the recombination mechanism and computed the formation energy of the peroxyl and non-bridging oxygen defects. We found that key recombination reaction paths are barrierless. In addition, we characterize the electronically excited states that may play a role in the chemical and physical processes that occur during recombination on these surface defect sites.},

 abstract = {We consider oxygen interactions with realistic silica surfaces, including both experimentally observed nondefective surface reconstructions and experimentally observed surface defects. Nondefective models include clusters representing the site above a fully coordinated surface Si atom and bridging O atoms, and the defective models include clusters representing an under-coordinated Si defect, a nonbridging O defect, and a ring structure. Energies were obtained for the approach of atomic and molecular oxygen to these clusters in various configurations by using explicitly correlated CCSD(T)-F12b electronic structure theory and the Minnesota density functionals, which were found to be in good agreement. The Minnesota functionals were employed in binding energy calculations for all of the clusters, considering the singlet and triplet spin states for nondefective clusters and doublet and quartet spin states for defective clusters. We find that the chosen defects are energetically favorable sites for binding. The density functional energies were used to extend the empirical ReaxFFSiO potential for silica, which was previously parametrized for bulk silica polymorphs (van Duin et al. J. Phys. Chem. A, 2003, 107, 3803–3811), to model the gas–surface interactions represented by the defective and nondefective clusters presented here. Interaction energy predictions from ReaxFFSiO GSI agree very well with the density functional energies. ReaxFFSiO GSI can now be employed in reactive large-scale molecular dynamics simulations involving oxygen–silica gas–surface interactions such as oxide growth and the heterogeneous recombination of oxygen occurring on real silica surfaces.},

 abstract = {Large scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to study the oxidation of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) by hyperthermal atomic oxygen beam (5 eV). Simulations are performed using the ReaxFF classical reactive force field. We present here additional evidence that this method accurately reproduces ab initio derived energies relevant to HOPG oxidation. HOPG is modeled as multilayer graphene and etch-pit formation and evolution is directly simulated through a large number of sequential atomic oxygen collisions. The simulations predict that an oxygen coverage is first established that acts as a precursor to carbon-removal reactions, which ultimately etch wide but shallow pits, as observed in experiments. In quantitative agreement with experiment, the simulations predict the most abundant product species to be O2 (via recombination reactions), followed by CO2, with CO as the least abundant product species. Although recombination occurs all over the graphene sheet, the carbon-removal reactions occur only about the edges of the etch pit. Through isolated defect analysis on small graphene models as well as trajectory analysis performed directly on the predicted etch pit, the activation energies for the dominant reaction mechanisms leading to O2, CO2, and CO product species are determined to be 0.3, 0.52, and 0.67 eV, respectively. Overall, the qualitative and quantitative agreement between MD simulation and experiment is very promising. Thus, the MD simulation approach and C/H/O ReaxFF parametrization may be useful for simulating high-temperature gas interactions with graphitic materials where the microstructure is more complex than HOPG.},

We find that the types of defects occurring on silica surfaces under vacuum and exposed to atomic oxygen at high temperatures are in agreement with previous MD simulations and experimental measurements of silica surfaces. The ReaxFFSiO GSI potential predicts a peroxyl defect that has not been observed in previous MD simulations of silica surfaces, but has been experimentally identified. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to validate the extent to which the ReaxFFSiO GSI potential predicts the structure and binding energy of the oxygen molecule on this defect. Through MD simulation and comparison with experiment, we identify the chemical surface defects that exist on real silica surfaces exposed to atomic oxygen at high temperatures and discuss their role in the catalytic recombination of atomic oxygen.},

Nonperiodic boundary conditions in the flow direction are applied by coupling the MD domain with a two-dimensional finite-volume computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver to correctly generate the inflow and outflow particle reservoirs. Detailed comparisons are made with direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) solutions using the variable-hard-sphere (VHS) collision model. By performing realistic MD simulations of full shock waves, this article presents a more sensitive evaluation of the VHS model parameters (via temperature and velocity distribution functions) than is possible using available experimental density measurements. In the high temperature range (300–8000 K), where the Chapman–Enskog theory supports the VHS model assumptions, near-perfect agreement between MD and DSMC solutions is demonstrated and inverse shock thickness predictions reproduce experimental measurements. In the low temperature range (16–300 K), theory predicts and MD simulation confirms that the VHS collision model becomes less valid.},

 abstract = {The molecular dynamics technique with the ab initio based classical reactive force field ReaxFF is used to study the adsorption dynamics of O(2) on Pt(111) for both normal and oblique impacts. Overall, good quantitative agreement with the experimental data is found at low incident energies. Specifically, our simulations reproduce the characteristic minimum of the trapping probability at kinetic incident energies around 0.1 eV. This feature is determined by the presence of a physisorption well in the ReaxFF potential energy surface (PES) and the progressive suppression of a steering mechanism when increasing the translational kinetic energy (or the molecule's rotational energy) because of steric hindrance. In the energy range between 0.1 and 0.4 eV, the sticking probability increases, similar to molecular beam sticking data. For very energetic impacts (above 0.4 eV), ReaxFF predicts sticking probabilities lower than experimental sticking data by almost a factor of 3 due to an overall less attractive ReaxFF PES compared to experiments and density functional theory. For oblique impacts, the trapping probability is reduced by the nonzero parallel momentum because of the PES corrugation and does not scale with the total incident kinetic energy. Furthermore, our simulations predict quasispecular (slightly supraspecular) distributions of angles of reflection, in accordance with molecular beam experiments. Increasing the beam energy (between 1.2 and 1.7 eV) causes the angular distributions to broaden and to exhibit a tail toward the surface normal because molecules have enough momentum to get very near the surface and thus probe more corrugated repulsive regions of the PES.},

 abstract = {We study the rotational relaxation process in nitrogen using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC). The intermolecular model used in the MD simulations is shown to (i) reproduce very well the shear viscosity of nitrogen over a wide range of temperatures, (ii) predict the near-equilibrium rotational collision number in good agreement with published trajectory calculations done on ab initio potential energy surfaces, and (iii) produce shock wave profiles in excellent accordance with the experimental measurements. We find that the rotational relaxation process is dependent not only on the near-equilibrium temperature (i.e., when systems relax to equilibrium after a small perturbation), but more importantly on both the magnitude and direction of the initial deviation from the equilibrium state. The comparison between MD and DSMC, based on the Borgnakke-Larsen model, for shock waves (both at low and high temperatures) and one-dimensional expansions shows that a judicious choice of a constant Zrot can produce DSMC results which are in relatively good agreement with MD. However, the selection of the rotational collision number is case-specific, depending not only on the temperature range, but more importantly on the type of flow (compression or expansion), with significant limitations for more complex simulations characterized both by expansion and compression zones. Parker's model, parametrized for nitrogen, overpredicts Zrot for temperatures above about 300 K. It is also unable to describe the dependence of the relaxation process on the direction to equilibrium. Finally, we present a demonstrative cell-based formulation of a rotational relaxation model to illustrate how, by including the key physics obtained from the MD data (dependence of the relaxation process on both the rotational and the translational state of the gas), the agreement between MD and DSMC solutions is drastically improved.},

The simulated relaxation process resulting from the selection procedure is analytically proven to be equivalent to the procedures of Haas et al.

 abstract = {Accurate modeling of high-temperature hypersonic flows in the atmosphere requires consideration of collision-induced dissociation of molecular species and energy transfer between the translational and internal modes of the gas molecules. Here, we describe a study of the N2 + N2⟶N2 + 2N and N2 + N2⟶4N nitrogen dissociation reactions using the quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) method. The simulations used a new potential energy surface for the N4 system; the surface is an improved version of one that was presented previously. In the QCT calculations, initial conditions were determined based on a two-temperature model that approximately separates the translational-rotational temperature from the vibrational temperature of the N2 diatoms. Five values from 8000 K to 30,000 K were considered for each of the two temperatures. Over 2.4 × 10(9) trajectories were calculated. We present results for ensemble-averaged dissociation rate constants as functions of the translational-rotational temperature T and the vibrational temperature T(v). The rate constant depends more strongly on T when T(v) is low, and it depends more strongly on T(v) when T is low. Quasibound reactant states contribute significantly to the rate constants, as do exchange processes at higher temperatures. We discuss two sets of runs in detail: an equilibrium test set in which T = T(v) and a nonequilibrium test set in which T(v) < T. In the equilibrium test set, high-v and moderately-low-j molecules contribute most significantly to the overall dissociation rate, and this state specificity becomes stronger as the temperature decreases. Dissociating trajectories tend to result in a major loss of vibrational energy and a minor loss of rotational energy. In the nonequilibrium test set, as T(v) decreases while T is fixed, higher-j molecules contribute more significantly to the dissociation rate, dissociating trajectories tend to result in a greater rotational energy loss, and the dissociation probability's dependence on v weakens. In this way, as T(v) decreases, rotational energy appears to compensate for the decline in average vibrational energy in promoting dissociation. In both the equilibrium and nonequilibrium test sets, in every case, the average total internal energy loss in the dissociating trajectories is between 10.2 and 11.0 eV, slightly larger than the equilibrium potential energy change of N2 dissociation.},

 abstract = {The direct molecular simulation (DMS) approach is used to predict the internal energy relaxation and dissociation dynamics of high-temperature nitrogen. An ab initio potential energy surface (PES) is used to calculate the dynamics of two interacting nitrogen molecules by providing forces between the four atoms. In the near-equilibrium limit, it is shown that DMS reproduces the results obtained from well-established quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) analysis, verifying the validity of the approach. DMS is used to predict the vibrational relaxation time constant for N2–N2 collisions and its temperature dependence, which are in close agreement with existing experiments and theory. Using both QCT and DMS with the same PES, we find that dissociation significantly depletes the upper vibrational energy levels. As a result, across a wide temperature range, the dissociation rate is found to be approximately 4–5 times lower compared to the rates computed using QCT with Boltzmann energy distributions. DMS calculations predict a quasi-steady-state distribution of rotational and vibrational energies in which the rate of depletion of high-energy states due to dissociation is balanced by their rate of repopulation due to collisional processes. The DMS approach simulates the evolution of internal energy distributions and their coupling to dissociation without the need to precompute rates or cross sections for all possible energy transitions. These benchmark results could be used to develop new computational fluid dynamics models for high-enthalpy flow applications.},

 abstract = {We present a molecular-level investigation of nitrogen dissociation at high temperature. The computational technique, called direct molecular simulation (DMS), solely relies on an ab initio potential energy surface and both N2+N2 and N+N2 processes are simulated as they concurrently take place in an evolving nonequilibrium gas system. Quasiclassical trajectory calculations (QCT) reveal that dissociation rate coefficients calculated at thermal equilibrium, i.e., assuming Boltzmann energy distributions, are approximately equal (within less than 15%) for both N2+N2 and N+N2 collisions for the range of temperatures considered. The DMS (nonequilibrium) results indicate, however, that the presence of atomic nitrogen significantly affects the dissociation rate of molecular nitrogen, but indirectly. In fact, the presence of atomic nitrogen causes an important reduction of the vibrational relaxation time of N2, by almost one order of magnitude. This, in turn, speeds up the replenishment of high-v states that are otherwise significantly depleted if only N2+N2 collisions are considered. Because of the strong favoring of dissociation from high-v states, this results in dissociation rates that are 2–3 times higher when significant atomic nitrogen is present compared to systems composed of mainly diatomic nitrogen, such as during the initial onset of dissociation. Specifically, we find that exchange events occur frequently during N+N2 collisions and that such exchange collisions constitute an effective mechanism of scrambling the internal energy states, resulting in multiquantum jumps in vibrational energy levels that effectively promote energy transfers. The resulting vibrational relaxation time constant we calculate for N+N2 collisions is significantly lower than the widely used Millikan-White model. Significant discrepancies are found between predictions of the Park two-temperature model (using the Millikan-White vibrational relaxation model) and the DMS results for dissociating nitrogen systems involving both atomic and molecular nitrogen. Such direct comparisons also illustrate how the DMS method is able to reveal all relevant nonequilibrium physics without the need to compute large numbers of state-transition probabilities. In this manner, DMS presents an accurate and tractable approach to construct models for direct-simulation Monte Carlo and computational fluid dynamics simulations from first principles.},

This implies that the velocity profile in the tube is nearly flat, consistent with volume diffusion, but not with laminar flow, Knudsen diffusion, or slip flow. However, molecular simulation calculations show that under the conditions used, the velocity profile is near parabolic when there is no deposition on the tube wall, inconsistent with volume diffusion, but in agreement with laminar flow. These calculations also show that deposition on the wall does result in velocity which is almost constant with radial position. The result is a laminar flow profile which is nearly flat, and hence a total flux proportional to the square of the tube diameter, which is observed both in these simulations and in physical experiments. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J , 63: 1757–1764, 2017 },

 abstract = {An oxidation model for carbon surfaces has been developed where the gas–surface reaction mechanisms and corresponding rate parameters are based solely on observations from recent molecular beam experiments. In the experiments, a high-energy molecular beam containing atomic and molecular oxygen (93% atoms and 7% molecules) was directed at a high-temperature carbon surface. The measurements revealed that carbon monoxide (CO) is the dominant reaction product and that its formation required a high surface coverage of oxygen atoms. As the temperature of the carbon sample was increased during the experiment, the surface coverage reduced and the production of CO was diminished. Most importantly, the measured time-of-flight distributions of surface reaction products indicated that CO and carbon dioxide (CO2) are predominately formed through thermal reaction mechanisms as opposed to direct abstraction mechanisms. These observations have enabled the formulation of a finite-rate oxidation model that includes surface-coverage dependence, similar to existing finite-rate models used in computational fluid dynamics simulations. However, each reaction mechanism and all rate parameters of the new model are determined individually based on the molecular beam data. The new model is compared to existing models using both zero-dimensional gas–surface simulations and computational fluid dynamics simulations of hypersonic flow over an ablating surface. The new model predicts similar overall mass loss rates compared to existing models; however, the individual species production rates are completely different. The most notable difference is that the new model (based on molecular beam data) predicts CO as the oxidation reaction product with virtually no CO2 production, whereas existing models predict the exact opposite trend.},

 abstract = { Heat flux and drag correlations are developed for high-speed flow over spherical geometries that are accurate for any Knudsen number ranging from continuum to free-molecular conditions. A stagnation point heat flux correlation is derived as a correction to the continuum (Fourier model) heat flux and also reproduces the correct heat flux in the free-molecular limit by use of a bridging function. In this manner, the correlation can be combined with existing continuum correlations based on computational fluid dynamics simulations, yet it can now be used accurately in the transitional and free-molecular regimes. The functional form of the stagnation point heat flux correlation is physics based, and was derived via the Burnett and super-Burnett equations in a recent article, Singh & Schwartzentruber ( J. Fluid Mech. , vol. 792, 2016, pp. 981–996). In addition, correlation parameters from the literature are used to construct simple expressions for the local heat flux around the sphere as well as the integrated drag coefficient. A large number of direct simulation Monte Carlo calculations are performed over a wide range of conditions. The computed heat flux and drag data are used to validate the correlations and also to fit the correlation parameters. Compared to existing continuum-based correlations, the new correlations will enable engineering analysis of flight conditions at higher altitudes and/or smaller geometry radii, useful for a variety of applications including blunt body planetary entry, sharp leading edges, low orbiting satellites, meteorites and space debris. },

In contrast to existing rotational energy models, we found that the rotational relaxation rate depends strongly on the initial degree of nonequilibrium and the direction towards the equilibrium state. Compressing flows involve fast excitation whereas expanding flows involve slow relaxation for the same equilibrium temperature. We developed a new rotation model for both DSMC and CFD simulation. At high temperatures we found clear evidence of rotational-vibrational energy coupling. In contrast to existing models, we propose that a coupled ro-vib relaxation time is required to model direct energy transfer between rotation and vibration at high temperatures and we present a new ro-vibrational model. Finally, we develop a numerical method that replaces the collision model in DSMC with MD trajectories. We verify that the new method exactly reproduces pure MD results. This advancement enables the simulation of axisymmetric and even 3D flows with the accuracy of pure MD.},

 abstract = {Vehicles traveling through an atmosphere at hypersonic speeds generate strong shock waves. These shock waves generate extremely high gas temperatures within the shock layer between the shock itself and the surface of the vehicle. As the gas reaches such high temperatures, its vibrational degrees of freedom become excited and diatomic and polyatomic molecules dissociate into reactive atomic species. At high altitudes characteristic of hypersonic flight where the free-stream density is low, these reactive species diffuse through the boundary layer and may chemically react with the vehicle s thermal protection system (TPS). Many TPS materials act as a catalyst for the heterogeneous recombination of dissociated species back into molecules. Such exothermic surface reactions transfer additional energy to the vehicle surface and thus contribute to the heat flux and overall heat load that the TPS must withstand. For example, studies have shown that surface catalysis can contribute up to 30% of the total heat load for Earth reentry [1].},

The Center combined the world's premiere hypervelocity testing facility at the CUBRC with state-of-the-art computational simulation methods at the University of Minnesota to rapidly advance the field of hypersonics. The Center supported fundamental research in hypersonics, including the development of high-quality experimental databases for code testing and validation of prediction tools. Many of these codes have been transferred to government and industry to enable optimized hypersonic vehicle designs. The Center also supported a rigorous graduate program that transferred technical capabilities from the previous generation of hypersonics experts to new students in the field.

 abstract = {All-atom computational chemistry (molecular dynamics -- MD) simulation of normal shock waves is demonstrated and validated with experimental data for shock structure. The only model input into such simulations is the potential energy surface (PES) that governs individual atomic interaction forces. In contrast to existing rotational energy models, we found that the rotational relaxation rate depends strongly on the initial degree of nonequilibrium and the direction towards the equilibrium state. Compressing flows involve fast excitation whereas expanding flows involve slow relaxation for the same equilibrium temperature. We developed a new rotation model for both DSMC and CFD simulation. At high temperatures we found clear evidence of rotational-vibrational energy coupling. In contrast to existing models, we propose that a coupled ro-vib relaxation time is required to model direct energy transfer between rotation and vibration at high temperatures and we present a new ro-vibrational model. Finally, we develop a numerical method that replaces the collision model in DSMC with MD trajectories. We verify that the new method exactly reproduces pure MD results. This advancement enables the simulation of axisymmetric and even 3D flows with the accuracy of pure MD.},

 abstract = {This paper summarizes research performed over the past decade on the direct molecular simulation of dilute gas flows. Similar to the molecular dynamics method, a potential energy surface is the sole model input to a direct molecular simulation calculation. However, instead of simulating the motion of all atoms in the system deterministically, the direct molecular simulation method uses stochastic techniques and assumptions, adopted from the well-established direct simulation Monte Carlo method, which are accurate for dilute gases. Using the same potential energy surface as input, the direct molecular simulation method is verified to exactly reproduce pure molecular dynamics results for shock-wave flows. The direct molecular simulation method is then used to investigate nonequilibrium flows such as strong shock waves and dissociating nitrogen systems involving rotation–vibration coupling and coupling between internal energy and dissociation. Direct molecular simulation algorithms are detailed, and a number of new results relevant to hypersonic flows are presented along with a summary of other recent results in the literature.},

 abstract = { Numerical methods are developed to simulate high temperature gas flow and coupled surface reactions, relevant to porous thermal protection systems used by hypersonic vehicles. Due to the non-continuum nature of these flows, the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is used, and the computational complexity of the simulations presents a number of unique challenges. Strategies for parallel partitioning, interprocessor communication, complex microstructure geometry representation, cutcell procedures, and parallel file input/output are presented and tested. Algorithms and data structures are developed for a microstructure generation tool called FiberGen that enables realistic microstructures to be constructed based on targeted fiber radius, orientation, and overall porosity, with user defined variations about these values. The data structures and algorithms associated with FiberGen are robust and efficient enough to enable DSMC simulations where the microstructure geometry changes to directly simulate ablation problems. Subsonic boundary conditions are described and validated, and a number of example solutions are presented. The example problems demonstrate the difference between surface ablation and in-depth volume ablation regimes for porous TPS materials.},

 abstract = {We studied adsorption dynamics of O2 on Pt(111) using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations with the ab initio based reactive force field ReaxFF. We found good quantitative agreement with the experimental data at low incident energies. Specifically, our simulations reproduce the characteristic minimum of the trapping probability at kinetic incident energies around 0.1 eV. This feature is determined by the presence of a physisorption well in the ReaxFF Potential Energy Surface (PES) and the progressive suppression of a steering mechanism as the translational kinetic energy (or the molecule’s rotational energy) is increased. In the energy range between 0.1 eV and 0.4 eV, the sticking probability increases, similarly to molecular beam sticking data. For very energetic impacts (above 0.4 eV), ReaxFF predicts sticking probabilities lower than experimental sticking data by almost a factor of 3, due to an overall less attractive ReaxFF PES compared to experiments and DFT.},

 abstract = {Efforts to use molecular dynamics (MD) to develop both non‐equilibrium dissociation models required in the shock layer as well as gas‐surface interaction models specifically for surface catalysis will be summarized. First, an accelerated MD algorithm for dilute gases is presented, called the Event‐Driven/Time‐Driven (ED/TD) MD method. The method detects and moves molecules directly to their impending collision while still integrating each collision, including multi‐body collisions, using conventional Time‐Driven (TD) MD with an arbitrary inter‐atomic potential. The simulation thus proceeds at time steps approaching the mean‐collision‐time. Preliminary nonequilibrium relaxation and normal shock wave simulations are in excellent agreement with direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) results with large speedups over conventional TD MD, especially at low densities. Second, an MD simulation technique to study surface catalysis employing the ReaxFF inter‐atomic potential is detailed. SiO2 surfaces are equilibrated with a dissociated gas mixture at various temperatures and pressures, establishing surface coverage. Rates of dominant reaction mechanisms, including adsorption, desorption, and E‐R/L‐H recombination, are then determined by counting individual events. The experimentally measured exponential dependence of recombination coefficient on temperature is well predicted by the MD simulations.},

 abstract = {The goal of this work is to model the heterogeneous recombination of atomic oxygen on silica surfaces, which is of interest for accurately predicting the heating on vehicles traveling at hypersonic velocities. This is accomplished by creating a finite rate catalytic model, which describes recombination from an atomistic perspective with a set of elementary gas-surface reactions. Fundamental to surface catalytic reactions are the chemical structures on the surface where recombination can occur. Using molecular dynamics simulations with the ReaxFF potential, we find that the chemical sites active in oxygen atom recombination on silica surfaces consist of a small number of specific defects. The individual reactions in our finite rate catalytic model are based on the possible outcomes of oxygen interaction with these defects. The parameters of the functional forms of the rates, including activation energies and pre-exponential factors, are found by carrying out molecular dynamics simulations of individual events. We find that the recombination coefficients predicted by the finite rate catalytic model display an exponential dependence with temperature, in qualitative agreement with experiment at between 1000 K - 1500 K. However, the ReaxFF potential requires reparametrization with new quantum chemical calculations specific to the reaction pathways presented in this work.},

 abstract = {We use Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation to investigate rotational relaxation in nitrogen from a first-principles perspective. The rotational relaxation process is found to be dependent not only on the near-equilibrium temperature, but more importantly on both the magnitude and direction of the initial deviation from the equilibrium state. Although this dependence has been previously recognized, it is here investigated systematically. The comparison between MD and Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), based on the Larsen-Borgnakke model, for shock waves (both at low and high temperatures) and onedimensional expansions shows that a judicious choice of a constant Zrot can produce DSMC results which are in relatively good agreement with MD. However, the selection of the rotational collision number is case-specific, depending not only on the temperature range, but more importantly on the type of flow (compression or expansion). Parker's model, with the commonly used parameters for nitrogen suggested by Lordi and Mates, overpredicts the magnitude of Zrot for temperatures above about 300 K. Finally, based on the MD data, a preliminary formulation for a novel directional rotational relaxation model, which includes a dependence on both the rotational and the translational state of the gas, is presented.},

The model is constructed by using data from direct molecular simulations (DMSs) of rapidly heated nitrogen gas using an ab initio potential energy surface (PES). The surprisal-based model is able to capture the overpopulation of high internal energy levels during the excitation phase and also the depletion of high internal energy levels during the quasi-steady-state (QSS) dissociation phase. Due to strong coupling between internal energy and dissociation chemistry, such non-Boltzmann effects can influence the overall dissociation rate in the gas. Conditions representative of the flow behind strong shockwaves, relevant to hypersonic flight, are analyzed. The surprisal-based model captures important molecular-level nonequilibrium physics, yet the simple functional form leads to a continuum-level expression that now accounts for the underlying energy distributions and their coupling to dissociation.},

@article{pub.1100902034,
 abstract = {This work presents the analysis of non-equilibrium energy transfer and dissociation of nitrogen molecules (N<sub>2</sub>(Σg+1)) using two different approaches: the direct molecular simulation (DMS) method and the coarse-grain quasi-classical trajectory (CG-QCT) method. The two methods are used to study thermochemical relaxation in a zero-dimensional isochoric and isothermal reactor in which the nitrogen molecules are heated to several thousand degrees Kelvin, forcing the system into strong non-equilibrium. The analysis considers thermochemical relaxation for temperatures ranging from 10 000 to 25 000 K. Both methods make use of the same potential energy surface for the N<sub>2</sub>(Σg+1)-N<sub>2</sub>(Σg+1) system taken from the NASA Ames quantum chemistry database. Within the CG-QCT method, the rovibrational energy levels of the electronic ground state of the nitrogen molecule are lumped into a reduced number of bins. Two different grouping strategies are used: the more conventional vibrational-based grouping, widely used in the literature, and energy-based grouping. The analysis of both the internal state populations and concentration profiles show excellent agreement between the energy-based grouping and the DMS solutions. During the energy transfer process, discrepancies arise between the energy-based grouping and DMS solution due to the increased importance of mode separation for low energy states. By contrast, the vibrational grouping, traditionally considered state-of-the-art, captures well the behavior of the energy relaxation but fails to consistently predict the dissociation process. The deficiency of the vibrational grouping model is due to the assumption of strict mode separation and equilibrium of rotational energy states. These assumptions result in errors predicting the energy contribution to dissociation from the rotational and vibrational modes, with rotational energy actually contributing 30%-40% of the energy required to dissociate a molecule. This work confirms the findings discussed in Paper I [R. L. Macdonald et al., J. Chem. Phys. 148, 054309 (2018)], which underlines the importance of rotational energy to the dissociation process, and demonstrates that an accurate non-equilibrium chemistry model must accurately predict the deviation of rovibrational distribution from equilibrium.},

 abstract = {Understanding gas–phase chemical kinetics is important for modeling hypersonic flows. This paper discusses quasiclassical trajectory analysis, in which gas–phase interactions are simulated using ab initio quantum chemistry data. N2+N2, N2+N, and N2+O2 collisions are studied for conditions at thermal equilibrium and nonequilibrium. The nitrogen dissociation rate with all collision partners is found to be similar for a given thermal environment: the largest deviation is 50% at thermal nonequilibrium, and at equilibrium the N2+N2 and N2+N rates are within 15% of each other. The vibrational energy decrease due to nitrogen dissociation, a necessary input to computational fluid dynamics, also behaves similarly for all collision partners and strongly depends on the degree of thermal nonequilibrium. Using data for nitrogen dissociation and oxygen dissociation with partner N2, the effect of each reactant state on dissociation is quantified. The effect of the collision partner’s internal energy on simple dissociation is found to be small and likely negligible.

 abstract = { Aerosol deposition (AD) can lead to the formation of dense coatings via deposition of particles from a gas flow; in AD the aerosol is passed through a converging-diverging nozzle, facilitating inertial particle impaction on a desired substrate at supersonic particle velocities. Unique from thermal spray methods, AD can be applied near room temperature and unique from cold spray, in AD the aerosol is typically at atmospheric pressure upstream of the nozzle. Though AD has been successfully demonstrated previously, a number of aspects related to particle motion in AD systems remain poorly understood. In this work, we simulated compressible flow field profiles and particle trajectories for typical AD working conditions for a slit type converging-diverging nozzle with a planar substrate. In examining the fluid flow profile, we show that the velocity and pressure profiles, as well as the shock structure are sensitive to the upstream and downstream operating pressures of the nozzle. These ultimately affect particle impaction speed. Importantly, in AD, the particle drag regime is dynamic; both particle Knudsen numbers and Mach numbers can vary by orders of magnitude. To aid particle trajectory simulations, we trained a neural network to predict the drag force on the particles based on existing experimental data, theoretical limits, and new direct simulation Monte Carlo (DMSC) results. The neural network based drag law, which depends upon both Mach and Knudsen numbers, shows better agreement with the DSMC simulation data than pre-existing correlations. With it, particle trajectory simulation results reveal that for a given particle density, there exists an optimal particle diameter to maximize particle impaction speed. We also find that in AD particles undergo size dependent inertial focusing, i.e. there is a particular particle diameter where the particle deposition linewidth is minimized. Particles smaller than this diameter are underfocused, and particles larger than this are overfocused, and hence have larger deposition linewidths in both cases. Using trajectory simulations, we additionally developed a framework that can be used to evaluate the position-dependent mass, momentum and kinetic energy fluxes to the deposition substrate for any aerosol size distribution function upstream of the nozzle. It is shown for typical aerosol concentrations achievable in the laboratory, the kinetic energy flux can approach a magnitude normally observed in convective heat transfer with phase change, hence translational kinetic energy to thermal energy transfer in AD is likely a key contributor to the formation of dense coatings.},

 abstract = {This paper presents molecular dynamics calculations of vibrational energy transfer and nonequilibrium dissociation in O2+O collisions. The O2+O interactions are modeled using nine potential energy surfaces corresponding to the 11A′, 21A′, 11A′′, 13A′, 23A′, 13A′′, 15A′, 25A′, and 15A′′ states, which govern electronically adiabatic collisions of ground-electronic-state collisions of diatomic oxygen with atomic oxygen. Characteristic vibrational excitation times are calculated over a temperature range of T=3000 K to T=15,000 K, and nonequilibrium dissociation rate coefficients are calculated over a temperature range of T=6000 K to T=15,000 K. Vibrational relaxation rates, specific to each PES, are found to vary by over an order of magnitude, indicating that all spin couplings and spatial degeneracies must be considered for accurate predictions of O2+O collisions. It has been observed that the characteristic vibrational excitation time for O2+O interactions is weakly dependent on temperature and increases slightly with increasing temperature. Predicted nonequilibrium dissociation rates, during quasi-steady state. Agree well with available experimental data, and the coupling between vibrational energy and dissociation is characterized.},

 abstract = {A variant of the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, referred to as direct molecular simulation (DMS), is used to study oxygen dissociation from first principles. The sole model input to the DMS calculations consists of 12 potential energy surfaces that govern O2 + O2 and O + O2 collisions, including all spin-spatial degenerate configurations, in the ground electronic state. DMS calculations are representative of the gas evolution behind a strong shock wave, where molecular oxygen excites rotationally and vibrationally before ultimately dissociating and reaching a quasi-steady-state (QSS). Vibrational relaxation time constants are presented for both O2 + O2 and O + O2 collisions and are found to agree closely with experimental data. Compared to O2 + O2 collisions, vibrational relaxation due to O + O2 collisions is found to be ten times faster and to have a weak dependence on temperature. Dissociation rate constants in the QSS dissociation phase are presented for both O2 + O2 and O + O2 collisions and agree (within experimental uncertainty) with rates inferred from shock-tube experiments. Both experiments and simulations indicate that the QSS dissociation rate coefficients for O + O2 interactions are about two times greater than the ones for O2 + O2. DMS calculations predict this to be a result of nonequilibrium (non-Boltzmann) internal energy distributions. Specifically, the increased dissociation rate is caused by faster vibrational relaxation, due to O + O2 collisions, which alters the vibrational energy distribution function in the QSS by populating higher energy states that readily dissociate. Although existing experimental data appear to support this prediction, experiments with lower uncertainty are needed for quantitative validation. The DMS data presented for rovibrational relaxation and dissociation in oxygen could be used to formulate models for DSMC and computational fluid dynamics methods.},

 abstract = {The present paper focuses on comparing state-of-the-art CFD and DSMC codes developed at the University of Minnesota; we compare results obtained with US3D, a code routinely used for complex hypersonic CFD simulations with those obtained using MGDS, a code capable of large-scale 3D DSMC simulations. This work is the first part of a long term effort to eventually perform coupled hybrid CFD-DSMC simulations using these codes. First, we compare the codes for canonical 1-D problems using a single species monoatomic gas. The Fourier heat transfer and Couette flow problems are chosen, where a varying Knudsen number is used to investigate non-continuum effects. The variable hard sphere (VHS) cross section model is used in MGDS and the consistent expressions for viscosity and thermal conductivity are used in US3D. For the lowest Knudsen number case (0.001) we observe excellent agreement between US3D and MGDS for both 1-D test cases. As the Knudsen number is increased in MGDS, the behavior gradually departs from the continuum solution. In order to investigate a more relevant 2-dimensional flow field with strong diffusive transport, we compare a shear flow generated by two parallel supersonic jets with different velocities using US3D and MGDS. Although this flow field has a discontinuity at the inflow that creates two oblique shocks, having the entire flow field remain supersonic allows for more consistent treatment of boundary conditions between DSMC and CFD. Comparisons are made at several locations, where the disagreement between peak values of heat flux and shear stress decreases as the distance from the inflow increases. Although the agreement is reasonable between US3D and MGDS, the differences motivate a more consistent comparison involving one-way coupling from CFD to DSMC as future work.},

Using both methods we study a simple zero-dimensional heat bath in which initially cold nitrogen molecules are instantaneously heated to between 5 000 K and 20 000 K. To isolate the effect of the N2-N collision processes, we ignore any reactions due to collisions between two molecules.

 abstract = {Dissociation is strongly coupled to the vibrational energy population of the dissociating gas. High-temperature excitation results in the overpopulation of high-energy states which enhances the dissociation rate as high-vibrational energy states are strongly favored to dissociation. Dissociation then results in the depletion of the high-energy population and consequently, a balance between excitation and dissociation is reached resulting in quasi-steady state (QSS). QSS is characterized by time-invariant non-Boltzmann depleted distributions and therefore reduced dissociation rates relative to the equilibrium estimates. In the kinetics models developed thus far, either the non-Boltzmann effects are ignored or added as pre-factors in an ad-hoc manner to an equilibrium rate constant. Recently, using ab initio potential energy surfaces, direct molecular simulation (DMS) approach has simulated the evolution of air species at the conditions representative of post-shock conditions. Based on the DMS data, a simple physics based model to characterize the non-Boltzmann distributions is developed. The model is compared with zero-dimensional DMS simulations for nitrogen and oxygen at constant temperature (isothermal) and constant energy (adiabatic) conditions. The non-Boltzmann distributions are then used in conjunction with state-specific dissociation rate constants to derive a non-equilibrium continuum dissociation model.},

 abstract = {Direct molecular simulations (DMS) of nitrogen dissociation in adiabatic reservoirs covering a wide enthalpy range are presented. These conditions more realistically reproduce the gas state in a hypersonic shock layer than prior isothermal DMS studies. The Minnesota ab initio potential energy surface is used for nitrogen molecule-molecule (N2−N2) and nitrogen atom-molecule (N−N2) classical trajectory calculations. Profiles of gas parameters (mixture composition, gas temperature, etc.) are reported, and the molecules’ internal energy population distributions during dissociation examined. It is observed that the evolution of the gas mixture under adiabatic conditions can be divided into two phases. Early on, excess translational energy is available for molecules to dissociate, regardless of their internal energy. This causes a sudden drop in the reservoir kinetic temperature and slows down subsequent dissociation. At later stages, the gas settles into a quasi-steady-state (QSS) regime, where dissociation proceeds primarily from higher-lying rovibrational levels near and above the dissociation threshold energy. The dissociation rate becomes limited by depletion of high-lying internal energy levels. Subsequently, adiabatic simulations are compared with prior isothermal DMS calculations performed at similar reservoir temperatures. The same shape is effectively observed for population distributions in both cases. This retroactively justifies the use of isothermal conditions to obtain QSS dissociation rate coefficients.},

 abstract = {In this article, we propose a generalized model for nonequilibrium vibrational energy distribution functions. The model can be used, in place of equilibrium (Boltzmann) distribution functions, when deriving reaction rate constants for high-temperature nonequilibrium flows. The distribution model is derived based on the recent ab initio calculations, carried out using potential energy surfaces developed using accurate computational quantum chemistry techniques for the purpose of studying air chemistry at high temperatures. Immediately behind a strong shock wave, the vibrational energy distribution is non-Boltzmann. Specifically, as the gas internal energy rapidly excites to a high temperature, overpopulation of the high-energy tail (relative to a corresponding Boltzmann distribution) is observed in ab initio simulations. As the gas excites further and begins to dissociate, a depletion of the high-energy tail is observed, during a time-invariant quasi-steady state. Since the probability of dissociation is exponentially related to the vibrational energy of the dissociating molecule, the overall dissociation rate is sensitive to the populations of these high vibrational energy states. The non-Boltzmann effects captured by the new model either enhance or reduce the dissociation rate relative to that obtained assuming a Boltzmann distribution. This article proposes a simple model that is demonstrated to reproduce these non-Boltzmann effects quantitatively when compared to ab initio simulations.},

First, we present a simple cross section model for dissociation that captures recent ab initio data accurately. The cross section model is analytically integrated over Boltzmann distributions and general non-Boltzmann distributions to derive a general non-equilibrium dissociation model. The general non-Boltzmann model systematically incorporates key physics such as dependence on translational energy, rotational energy, vibrational energy, internal energy, centrifugal barrier, and non-Boltzmann effects such as overpopulation and depletion of high energy states. The model is shown to reproduce the rates from quasi-classical trajectory calculations for Boltzmann distributions of internal energy states. The reduced rates in a non-equilibrium steady state due to depletion of high internal energy states are also predicted well by the model. Furthermore, the model predicts the enhanced rates as observed due to significant overpopulation of high vibrational states relative to Boltzmann distributions while the gas is in non-equilibrium in the transient phase. The model provides a computationally inexpensive way of incorporating non-equilibrium chemistry without incurring additional cost in the existing computational tools. Further comparisons of the model are carried out in Paper II, where simplifications to the model are proposed based on the results.},

We study a mixture of nitrogen molecules and atoms forced into strong thermochemical non-equilibrium by sudden exposure of rovibrationally cold gas to a high-temperature heat bath. We observe excellent agreement between the DMS and StS-ME predictions for the transfer rates of translational into rotational and vibrational energy, as well as of dissociation rates across a wide range of temperatures. Both methods agree down to the microscopic scale, where they predict the same non-Boltzmann population distributions during quasi-steady-state dissociation. Beyond establishing the equivalence of both methods, this cross-validation helped in reinterpreting the NASA Ames kinetic database and resolve discrepancies observed in prior studies.

A 120, 5348-5359 (2016)]. These calculations are compared to experimental data in order to further validate Potential Energy Surfaces (PESs) recently developed at the University of Minnesota [Z. Varga, Y. Paukku, and D. G. Truhlar, J. Chem. Phys. 147, 154312 (2017)]. Spin and spatial symmetries allow nine adiabatic PESs to represent the ground state interactions of O<sub>2</sub> + O. We simulate trajectories adiabatically on all nine surfaces and perform analysis on data from each surface separately and the combined set of nine. It is shown that aggregated adiabatic calculations from nine surfaces agree better with the experiment for both inelastic and exchange collisions than a previous study that used a single surface and lie within the reported experimental uncertainty at almost all points. Distributions for exchange reactions using all nine PESs are interpreted using each surface's opacity function and activation energy for exchange. Rovibrationally resolved product distributions are then studied for a better understanding of energy relaxation in exchange collisions and may prove useful for further quasiclassical trajectory study and new experiments that use rovibrational spectroscopy to resolve the internal energy of the scattered products.},

particles moving in a fluid is derived. The proposed correlation incorporates
essential rarefied physics, low-speed hydrodynamics, and shock-wave physics to
accurately model the particle-drag force for a wide range of Mach and Knudsen
numbers (and therefore Reynolds number) a particle may experience. Owing to the
basis of the derivation in physics-based scaling laws, the proposed correlation
embeds gas-specific properties and has explicit dependence on the ratio of
specific heat capacities at constant pressure and constant volume. The
correlation is applicable for arbitrary particle relative velocity, particle
diameter, gas pressure, gas temperature, and surface temperature. Compared to
existing drag models, the correlation is shown to more accurately reproduce a
wide range of experimental data. Finally, the new correlation is applied to
simulate dust particles' trajectories in high-speed flow, relevant to a
spacecraft entering the Martian atmosphere. The enhanced surface heat flux due
to particle impact is found to be sensitive to the particle drag model.},

 abstract = {We present gas-phase recombination rate constants computed using Quasi Classical Trajectory (QCT) data without a direct appeal to detailed balance. The recombination rate constant is the product of a triple collision rate and a probability of recombination from triple collisions. We evaluate the triple collision rate as a binary collision rate between colliding pairs and third particles using the lifetimes of colliding pairs from QCT simulations. The lifetimes of O + O2 collisions are shown to be much longer than for O + O pairs because the O2 internal modes absorb translational energy and trap the particles in their interaction potential. The recombination probabilities are calculated from three body QCT simulations where, per collision, recombination from O + O + O collisions is shown to be more likely than recombination from O + O + O2 collisions by a factor of ≈ 2. Even so, calculated recombination rate constants are shown to be dominated by O + O + O2 collisions because the triple collision rate involving O + O2 pairs is ≈ 10 times larger.},

 abstract = {We present direct molecular simulations (DMS) of rovibrational excitation and dissociation of oxygen in a constant-volume, adiabatic reactor and across a normal shock wave. This setup aims to reproduce the nonequilibrium conditions in the shock tube experiments of Ibraguimova et al. (JChemPhys 2013). We examine internal energy and vibrational population distributions of the O2 ­molecules at several stages of the process and observe overpopulated and depleted populations in the high-energy tail at different stages of dissociation. In the adiabatic simulations we observe how the characteristic length scales for vibrational relaxation and dissociation are affected by lowering the total enthalpy of the upstream gas. We then compare vibrational temperatures from our simulations with those inferred from the shock tube tests and obtain reasonable agreement. Finally, we compare the adiabatic reactor DMS calculations with the equivalent normal shock simulations. Our assessment is that, while the adiabatic reactor does a reasonable job of reproducing the thermo-chemical state of the shocked gas, it actually generates more severe initial nonequilibrium conditions than what is observed in the normal shock.},

We simulate a five species air mixture with different free stream conditions using both US3D, a code routinely used for complex hypersonic computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, and MGDS, a code capable of large-scale 3D Direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) calculations. We study the effect of the reactions through the comparison between the Park model, the Modified Marrone-Treanor chemical kinetics model, available in US3D, and the total collision energy model, available in MGDS. We observed intriguing discrepancies in the near-wall region. Therefore, we quantify the diffusive transport terms and identify the leading diffusive phenomena. Furthermore, we implemented the transport properties derived from the Chapman-Enskog method for a multi-component mixture and repeated the same test case. All the CFD simulations neglect the thermal diffusion term, which we have found are not negligible at these conditions.},

 abstract = {The oxidation of carbon-based ablative thermal protection systems is affected by the diffusion of gas from the boundary layer into the mesostructure and the reactivity of the gas with the microstructure (i.e. carbon fibers). To capture both of these effects, a DSMC approach is used and coupled to the ablating FiberGen code. FiberGen allows for movement of the triangles that make up the microstructure to account for gas surface reactions that remove carbon. A Thiele number analysis is performed based on the Stardust reentry trajectory to examine the diffusion of oxygen into the mesostructure at different trajectory points. In order to closely simulate the physics of a hypersonic boundary layer, a procedure for accurately imposing a CFD boundary layer onto a DSMC domain is presented. Subsequently, realistic boundary layer profiles from two Stardust reentry trajectory points are imposed over a mesostructure with and without ablation. This work provides insight on how in-depth oxidation occurs at flight relevant conditions.},

 abstract = {We present a novel method of Objective Molecular Dynamics (OMD) for the study of air chemistry at high temperatures far-from-equilibrium flows commonly encountered in hypersonic conditions. The method gives a way of simulating a three parameter family of homogeneous incompressible, and a nine parameter family of general compressible, unsteady flows without incurring boundary effects, which is ideal for extracting bulk properties of the system. Besides the usual advantage of molecular dynamics simulations of relying only on a potential energy surface, OMD has an additional advantage. Here, only a finite number of atoms are simulated, and motions of all the other atoms (typically infinitely many) are given by applying an isometry group to the simulated atoms. All atoms, simulated and nonsimulated, satisfy exactly the equations of molecular dynamics for their forces. In this work, we use OMD to simulate an inviscid flow of homoenergetic compression of dissociating nitrogen gas and report the non-Boltzmann effects of overpopulation and underpopulation of the vibrational energy distribution. We also compare evolution of gas in an adiabatic reactor simulated by usingOMD to those simulated by a different modeling approach of Direct Molecular Simulation (DMS) for non-equilibrium initial conditions.},

 abstract = {Velocity-slip and temperature-jump effects on sharp leading-edge geometries are studied for three canonical hypersonic flows: the hollow-cylinder-flare, the double-cone, and the double-wedge. Simulation results are compared between the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method that naturally captures slip effects and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using an appropriate slip model. Only the leading-edge portions of these flow configurations are studied. The simulations are verified to be converged in terms of grid and particle resolution. Overall, excellent agreement is found between DSMC and CFD predictions of the leading-edge boundary layer, the magnitude of velocity-slip and temperature-jump, and surface heat flux for all cases considered, with the exception of the double-cone case due to the relatively high Knudsen number of the flow. The largest discrepancies were found for the double-cone (transitional flow conditions), and near-exact agreement was found for the double-wedge (continuum flow conditions). It was determined that slip effects cannot account for the discrepancy between CFD predictions and experimentally measured heat flux for the hollow-cylinder flare. Furthermore, it was determined that the previously recommended threshold for the continuum breakdown parameter might be overly conservative in the near-wall region if appropriate slip models are used in CFD.},

 abstract = {The environment encountered by space vehicles in very low Earth orbit (VLEO, 180 – 350 km altitude) contains predominantly atomic oxygen (AO) and molecular nitrogen (N2), which collide with ram surfaces at relative velocities of ~7.5 km s-1. Structural, thermal-control, and coating materials containing organic polymers are particularly susceptible to AO attack at these high velocities, resulting in erosion, roughening, and degradation of function. Copolymerization or blending of a polymer with polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) yields a material that can resist AO attack through the formation of a passivating silicon-oxide layer. Still, these hybrid organic/inorganic polymers become rough through AO reactions as the passivating layer is forming. Surface roughness may enhance satellite drag because it promotes energy transfer and scattering angle randomization during gas-surface collisions. As potential low-drag and AO-resistant materials, we have investigated POSS-containing films of clear and Kapton-like polyimides that have an atomically smooth AO-resistant coating of Al2O3 that is grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Coated and uncoated films were exposed to hyperthermal molecular beams containing atomic and molecular oxygen to investigate their AO resistance, and molecular beam-surface scattering studies were conducted to characterize the gas-surface scattering dynamics on pristine and AO-exposed surfaces to inform drag predictions. The AO erosion yield of Al2O3 ALD-coated films is essentially zero. Simulations of drag on a representative satellite structure that are based on the observed scattering dynamics suggest that the use of the Al2O3 ALD-coated POSS-polyimides on external satellite surfaces have the potential to reduce drag to less than half that predicted for diffuse scattering surfaces. These smooth and AO-resistant polymer films thus show promise for use in the extreme oxidizing and high-drag environment in VLEO.},

Previous studies have laid out viable methodologies for estimating the amount of surface recession from a significant dust storm, but they rely on underlying modeling assumptions that are difficult to validate. The current work utilizes the DUST library, which is a Lagrangian particle solver under development at NASA Ames Research Center. DUST includes variable-fidelity fluid-particle coupling and has been tested for a wide range of problem types. The DUST library is used in conjunction with the US3D Navier-Stokes solver. Using these tools, a sensitivity study is performed to determine the influence of the underlying dust modeling (drag coefficient, Nusselt number, and size distribution) on the surface erosion through a hypersonic Martian entry trajectory. The surface erosion was found to be insensitive to the drag and heating models, but was affected significantly by the size distribution parameters. The total recession was comparable to the thermochemical ablation predicted by a material response code, but the lack of a particle erosion model for PICA limits the predictive capability of the current work.},

As a result, material selection and understanding material response to aerothermal loading is important. The presence of particles in the atmosphere and the potential for a vehicle to fly through precipitation at low altitudes may cause substantial damage to leading edges and control surfaces of high-speed flight vehciles. Computational techniques for modeling the physics of particles and droplets, and their interactions with solids in various flow regimes, are investigated, particularly those that might impact thermal protection systems for aircraft at high velocities. A multi-material fluid based approach for modeling problems in this regime is examined. This method combines Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) hydrodynamics with Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) and includes an anisotropic stress tensor and multi-zone physics. The method is tested for small particles (4 $\mu m$ diameter) impacting a material surface at high speeds (500 - 700 m/s).},

We extract characteristic times of rotational and vibrational relaxation over a wide temperature range for the diatom-diatom interactions N2-N2, O2-O2, N2-O2 and O2-N2, as well as for diatom-atom interactions N2-N, O2-O, O2-N, etc. These results rely entirely on first-principles calculations, where a set of potential energy surfaces (PESs) constitute the sole model input. Where possible, we compare our DMS results with experimentally derived relaxation times and the standard correlation-based estimates from Millikan & White and Park. Furthermore, we apply the DMS method to the simulation of coupled internal energy relaxation, molecular dissociation and exchange reactions in 5-species air (N2, N, O2, O, NO) at high temperature. These calculations incorporate the full set of ab initio potentials currently available from the University of Minnesota computational chemistry group. This setup allows us to study the effect of competing reactions in the consumption of molecular oxygen and nitrogen and simultaneous formation of nitric oxide. Special emphasis is placed on extracting the rate coefficients for the two Zel'dovich exchange reactions during the quasi-steady-state (QSS) dissociation phase. These QSS rate coefficients are then compared to thermal rate coefficients for the same reactions obtained via quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) calculations on the same PESs. Our comparisons strongly suggest that both exchange reactions proceed at their thermal rates, without any vibrational biasing. The same is not true for the dissociation reactions during QSS.},

The resulting stress and temperature profiles are compared with corresponding macroscopic profiles derived from Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) continuum mechanics. Agreement between NSF and computational data is found for small shear rates. We also investigate the regime where NSF has limitations in predicting the correct behavior. As an alternative method to achieve better prediction in this regime, we use theory of Rivlin-Ericksen (RE). We propose and calibrate the non-linear RE constitutive model using OMD results. The model is shown to reduce to NSF theory in the limit of low gradient flows and make significant improvement over it under far-from-equilibrium conditions. We also establish the connection between RE and kinetic theory for a gas composed of Maxwellian molecules in simple shear.},

 abstract = {View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-1635.vid The dissociation and recombination of diatomic molecules in shock layers around high speed vehicles have first order effects on the chemical and thermal energy fluxes to those vehicles’ heat shields. The Direct Molecular Simulation (DMS) technique has been used to study the dissociation process in detail, and results have shown the existence of binary collisions that last for very long times. This work studies the recombination process using the Quasi Classical Trajectory (QCT) method to determine the importance of these long-lived collisions. Recombination reactions require the collision of three bodies, which can be broadly grouped into two types: the direct collision of three particles, and the multi-step collision of an interacting pair of particles with a third. Recent work presented triple collision rate constants constructed from binary collision lifetimes without a direct appeal to detailed balance, but found that the lifetime definition used was not adequate to describe both types of triple collisions. This work uses a lifetime based three body collision rate constant that allows any binary collision to result in either type of triple collision. Distributions of binary lifetimes are studied to show that most binary collisions are short, lasting less than 20000 fs, and that while binary collisions lasting longer are very rare, they become more prevalent for O + O2 collisions at low temperatures. The recombination probabilities for three different O2 formation pathways are compared, and the resulting total recombination rate constants are within an order of magnitude of predictions from detailed balance. Our results indicate that very long-lived binary collisions are exceedingly rare, and do not contribute significantly to the recombination process at temperatures ranging from 1000 K - 5000 K in oxygen.},

Many TPS are porous carbon fiber based materials that ablate and often involve material pyrolysis. One current research focus aims to provide uncertainty quantification and ensure reliability of such TPS systems, especially in regards to material failure. Such TPS materials often have complex micro and mesostructure (various fiber arrangements). This article presents numerical simulations (direct simulation Monte Carlo) of flight-relevant boundary layer flow over resolved material meso structure, and presents results for the heat flux, traction forces, and reactive atomic oxygen flux on the fiber surfaces. Instead of predicting single values for these properties at a macroscopic scale on the surface, the simulations predict probability distribution functions for these properties on the fiber surfaces. This information could be used in new stochastic models for material response and failure. This article presents boundary layer flow results that now include convection, diffusion, and simulated pyrolysis blowing effects. It is observed that the addition of a blowing gas slightly reduces the heat flux, traction, and atomic oxygen flux to the fiber surfaces, compared to simulations without a blowing gas. These reductions are quantified and distributions of these properties are analyzed.},

 abstract = {We present direct molecular simulations (DMSs) of rovibrational excitation and dissociation of oxygen across normal shock waves. These are the first atomistic simulations of normal shock waves to rely exclusively on ab initio potential energy surfaces to describe the full collision dynamics (accounting for elastic, inelastic and reactive processes) in a dilute gas mixture of molecular and atomic oxygen. The simulated setup aims to reproduce two of the experimental conditions in the shock tube tests of Ibraguimova et al. (J Chem Phys 139:034317, 2013). We compare mixture composition and vibrational temperatures extracted from our simulations with those inferred from the shock tube tests and observe good agreement. In addition to this, we report macroscopic moments due to dissipative transport across the shock, i.e., species diffusion fluxes, viscous stresses and heat flux. Furthermore, we examine the distributions of vibrational and total internal energy of the O2$$\hbox {O}_{2}$$ molecules at several locations across the shock wave. We are able to follow the gradual transition from pre-shock to post-shock population distributions and, in both cases studied, find depletion of the high-energy tail of the internal energy distributions due to preferential dissociation from states close to the dissociation energy D0$$D_0$$. Finally, we extract molecular velocity distributions functions (VDF) of O2$$\hbox {O}_{2}$$ and O at selected locations across the shock to delimit the region where continuum breakdown occurs.},

@article{pub.1145916203,
 abstract = {A recombination reaction model for high-temperature chemical kinetics is analytically derived from ab initio simulation data. When atoms recombine, the kinetic rate model shows that product molecules favor high vibrational energy states. In this manner, recombination repopulates high vibrational energy states depleted by dissociation, in a high-temperature reacting gas. Coupling of internal energy relaxation, dissociation, and recombination results in depleted or overpopulated (relative to a corresponding Boltzmann distribution) vibrational energy distributions. Through a simple model, we show that non-Boltzmann behavior, in other words, depletion or overpopulation of high-energy states, is not only linked to thermal nonequilibrium but also chemical nonequilibrium. The mathematical derivation also indicates that the conventional approach for modeling recombination rates, where shock-tube dissociation rate measurements are combined with the principle of detailed balance, is incorrect. The complete analytical dissociation/recombination model embeds all relevant kinetic processes, including specific terms for translation/rotation/vibration/chemistry coupling, anharmonic and quasi-bound effects, and non-Boltzmann depletion and overpopulation effects. The model is a multitemperature model that can be used within computational fluid dynamics simulations with no appreciable increase in computational expense. Finally, because the model is analytical, containing separate terms for various physical effects, further model simplification could be performed depending on the flow conditions of interest.},

 abstract = {Simple-to-use damage models are important in predicting the outcome of high speed particle impacts for high speed vehicles traveling in particle laden flows. Such models largely hinge upon experimental data from well-characterized single-impact events. In this study we developed and applied an experimental system to systematically examine surface cratering and particle deposition driven by high speed micrometer particle impacts onto Aluminum 6061-T6 substrates and Inconel 718 substrates. Monodisperse ferrous sulfate particles 1.8 and 6.2 micrometer in diameter were accelerated using a converging-diverging nozzle to achieve varying impact velocities in the range of 0.29–0.84 km s-1 as measured by laser Doppler velocimetry. Post-mortem surface characterization was carried out using a combination of atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. For the aluminum samples, we then utilize traditional non-dimensional groups to develop scaling relationships between crater size, particle size, velocity and incident angle. Measurement results are found to agree with data from previous studies at higher impact velocities, but notably with a sharper slope between dimensionless crater size and dimensionless impact energy, indicative of a non-negligible amount of particle elastic rebound influencing the outcome of the impact process. In addition, in contrast to crater formation observed on aluminum, equivalent impacts onto Inconel 718 led to no discernible crater formation and instead adhesion and deformation of the impacting particles.},

 abstract = {In this study, we propose the use of the novel approach of objective molecular dynamics (OMD) simulating far-from-equilibrium gas dynamics problems with chemical reactions. The OMD method has an exact relation to models in continuum mechanics and can be used to improve those models. We provide a detailed molecular dynamics investigation of chemically reacting nitrogen gas in a space-homogeneous adiabatic reactor. The analysis is based on a first-principles derived reactive ReaxFF potential energy surface, which captures the relevant processes of rovibrational relaxation, dissociation, and exchange as well as recombination in a gas evolving under non-equilibrium conditions. We examine the evolution of the internal mode population distribution of all the molecules as well as the rovibrational probability distribution of the pre-collision dissociating and post-collision recombined N2 molecules to investigate the microscopic selectivity of various reactive processes. Subsequently, we make comparisons with results obtained by means of an alternative modeling approach called direct molecular simulation. The current work illustrates the application of the method of OMD to study the compression and expansion kinetics of dissociation-recombination nitrogen mixture relevant to normal shock wave and nozzle expansion.},

 abstract = {The relationship between gas-surface scattering dynamics and flow through conical systems in the rarefied regime has been explored with experimental and computational tools. Molecular beam-surface scattering experiments were used to characterize the inelastic scattering dynamics of Ar and N2 on a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surface. These data were then used to develop a gas-surface scattering approach for kinetic fluid simulations, which combines the diffuse scattering and Cercignani-Lampis-Lord (CLL) models. The translational energy and angular flux distributions from the beam-surface scattering experiments were used to obtain the normal energy accommodation ( α n ) parameter as well as the effective surface mass (M) in the CLL model. Constant values of α n = 0.9 , M = 40 amu for Ar and α n = 0.75 , M = 28 amu for N2 were found to capture the experimental angular flux scattering distributions over a wide range of incident energies and angles. The gas-surface model was subsequently used in direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) simulations of the flux of directed gas flow through a conical concentrator and compared with measurements of gas concentration with a prototype concentrator in separate molecular beam experiments. Comparisons of predicted concentration pressure ratios (pressure in an accommodation chamber with vs. without concentrator) with measured values for three free-stream velocities of Ar and N2 showed maximum deviations of 4.8% and 9.8% for Ar and N2, respectively. The simulations show that gas-surface collisions resulting in the loss of the normal component of the incident energy while preserving the tangential momentum of the impinging atom or molecule, resulting in super-specular scattering, lead to higher concentration of gases than purely specular, energy conserving gas-surface interactions. For conical concentrators, with inlet-to-outlet area ratios of 133 and 600, specular reflections result in concentration factors (flux through an orifice with vs. without concentrator) of only ∼8, while super-specular scattering results in concentration factors of 64 and 127, respectively.},

 abstract = {We present theory and a simulation framework to model three-body collisions and gas phase recombination in dilute atom/diatom mixtures of pure oxygen (O/O2) and nitrogen (N/N2) using the Quasi-Classical Trajectory method. We formulate a three-body collision rate constant based on the lifetimes of binary collisions and initialize three-body collisions by sampling the arrival time of a third body within the lifetimes of pre-simulated binary collisions. We use this method to calculate distributions of recombined product energies, probabilities of recombination, and recombination rate constants through different collision pathways. Long-lived binary atom-diatom collisions are observed, but are too rare to play a dominant role in the recombination process for shock-heated air near the equilibrium conditions studied. The resulting recombination rate constants are within an order of magnitude of the predictions of detailed balance. Notably, the recombination simulation framework does not appeal to the principle of detailed balance and could be useful for studying conditions far from equilibrium.},

 abstract = { We propose a constitutive equation for flows of gases in high-rate regimes where the Navier–Stokes theory breaks down. The model generalizes the Navier–Stokes relation and agrees well with that model in all lower rate flows examined. Our proposed constitutive relation is calibrated with the method of objective molecular dynamics (OMD) using families of compressible and incompressible flows of Lennard-Jones argon. The constitutive relation makes use of the higher-order objective strain rates due to Rivlin and Ericksen ( J. Rat. Mech. Anal. , vol. 4, 1955, pp. 323–425). The constitutive relation is fully frame-indifferent, and the macroscopic flows corresponding to the OMD simulations are exact solutions for the proposed model. The model is shown to agree with atomistic results much better than the Navier–Stokes equations in the transition regime. The success of our model indicates that it is not higher gradients that become important in the high-rate regime, but rather higher rates of change of the strain rate tensor. While somewhat more complicated to implement than the Navier–Stokes relation, the proposed model is expected to be compatible with existing methods of computational fluid dynamics and may extend those methods to higher rate regimes, while preserving their ability to handle large spatial scales. },

 abstract = {This study utilizes in-situ data of stratospheric particle size distributions to understand particle-surface impacts at hypersonic flight conditions. Particle diameters range from 0.2 to [Formula: see text]. Simulations are performed to track Lagrangian particles through the flowfield and statistically gather the characteristics of particles that impact the surface. Probability density functions in terms of surface-impact locations, particle sizes, velocities, incident angles, and kinetic energies are presented. The results indicate that sub-micrometer-diameter particles most frequently impact the nosetip of the vehicle at a range of velocities that tend toward the freestream velocity at higher altitudes. However, it does not appear that sub-micrometer particles significantly contribute to the net surface-impact kinetic energy. It is shown that larger particles between 6 and [Formula: see text] are responsible for the majority of net surface-impact kinetic energy, despite these surface-impact events being infrequent.},

 abstract = {We present first-principles calculations for chemically reacting five-species air ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]) over a range of gas temperatures ([Formula: see text]), relying exclusively on ab initio potential energy surfaces (PESs) from the University of Minnesota Computational Chemistry group to describe the forces between atoms. We use these PESs within direct molecular simulations (DMSs) and quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) calculations to determine the coupling of internal energy relaxation to chemical reactions. From DMS we extract the internal energy populations of diatomic species during the quasi-steady-state (QSS) dissociation phase and, for all diatomic species, observe depleted high-energy tails relative to corresponding Boltzmann distributions. A comparison of thermochemical equilibrium rate coefficients (from QCT) with those during QSS (from DMS) helps quantify the macroscopic effects of vibrationally depleted distributions on dissociation. In contrast, Zeldovich exchange reactions are almost unaffected by these vibrationally depleted distributions. Unlike dissociation, they do not exhibit significant vibrational bias and take place at near-thermal rates at all temperatures studied. Furthermore, we quantify the amount of vibrational and rotational energy removed and/or gained in exchange and dissociation reactions. Such macroscopic quantities are of interest for enhancing the fidelity of multitemperature nonequilibrium chemistry models used in computational fluid dynamics codes.},

@article{pub.1171380084,
 abstract = {The deposition pattern or “linewidth” of an inertial particle deposit from acceleration of an aerosol through a high aspect ratio slit nozzle-substrate system is influenced by particle size-dependent aerodynamic focusing. In addition to this, high aspect ratio jets will eventually undergo downstream “jet-axis switching”, wherein the jet profile shrinks along its major axis and elongates in the direction of the minor axis. Jet axis switching in an aerosol may also lead to “rotated” particle deposits. In this study, we use a converging–diverging slit nozzle system with a major axis length of 8 mm and a throat width (minor axis) of 200 μ m to examine the deposition patterns of monodisperse particles in the 100 nm–5 μ m diameter range, in air with an upstream pressure of 252 Torr and variable downstream pressure in the 3–50 Torr range. The nozzle-to-substrate distance L ∗ is varied from 90 to 248 times longer than the throat width. We find deposition patterns that are strongly dependent on particle size, downstream pressure, and L ∗ . Depending on particle diameter and operating conditions, we obtain deposits resembling the nozzle dimensions and orientation, deposits which are completely switched (perpendicular to the nozzle), or deposits which are relatively symmetric and focused at a center point. The latter appear to be the result of the combined effects of jet axis switching and aerodynamic focusing. In general, the influence of jet axis switching is more pronounced on smaller particles at higher downstream pressures, and with larger distances to the substrate. The extent of switching and area of the deposit are also both inversely related to the particle Stokes number.},

 abstract = {With regard to the thermal protection system, the thermal–structural responses of modern ablative materials are of primary importance in many aspects, including material selection and sizing. Due to the intricate nature of their porous structure and complicated thermal conditions they are subjected to, ablative materials may exhibit unexpected behavior, which can potentially lead to material failure. In this study, two solvers—a direct simulation Monte Carlo solver and a finite-volume-based material response solver—are coupled together to predict the microscale thermal–structural performance of a thermal protection system material like phenolic impregnated carbon ablator. In this approach, individual fibers are modeled at the microscale, which provides valuable knowledge of porous media behavior. Nonuniform boundary conditions, including the heat flux and external force, are captured by the direct simulation Monte Carlo solver, and the detailed thermal and structural performance of the fiber is captured by the material response solver. The results show that individual fibers do not fail based on the temperature gradient and applied aerodynamic forces. However, it is shown that the attachment points of the fibers are the most vulnerable. This vulnerability can potentially lead to a breakdown of the binders, which would separate fibers and cause material failure.},
