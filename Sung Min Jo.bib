 abstract = {In the present study, the narrow-band k-distribution (NBK) model parameters for mixtures of H2O, CO2, and CO are proposed by utilizing the line-by-line (LBL) calculations with a single mixture gas assumption. For the application of the NBK model to radiative flows, a radiative transfer equation (RTE) solver based on a finite-volume method on unstructured meshes was developed. The NBK model and the RTE solver were verified by solving two benchmark problems including the spectral radiance distribution emitted from one-dimensional slabs and the radiative heat transfer in a truncated conical enclosure. It was shown that the results are accurate and physically reliable by comparing with available data. To examine the applicability of the methods to realistic multi-dimensional problems in non-isothermal and non-homogeneous conditions, radiation in an axisymmetric combustion chamber was analyzed, and then the infrared signature emitted from an aircraft exhaust plume was predicted. For modeling the plume flow involving radiative cooling, a flow-radiation coupled procedure was devised in a loosely coupled manner by adopting a Navier-Stokes flow solver based on unstructured meshes. It was shown that the predicted radiative cooling for the combustion chamber is physically more accurate than other predictions, and is as accurate as that by the LBL calculations. It was found that the infrared signature of aircraft exhaust plume can also be obtained accurately, equivalent to the LBL calculations, by using the present narrow-band approach with a much improved numerical efficiency.},

 abstract = {In the present study, a CFD-based database is proposed to predict surficial pressure loading. To evaluate flow properties, a three-dimensional multi-phase Navier–Stokes flow solver based on unstructured meshes was utilized. Relative motion between a platform and a projectile was described using six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) equations of motion and an overset mesh technique. Accuracy of the 6-DOF module in the flow solver was validated by solving a benchmark problem. Four major parameters related to the surficial pressure loading were selected, which are escaping velocity, pressure of compressed gas flows, freestream velocity, and depth of water. Initial sample points were estimated by applying an improved Latin hypercube sampling method. To evaluate a flow condition with the maximum surficial pressure loading in a given database, a genetic algorithm and an artificial neural network were utilized. Then, accuracy of the database was iteratively evaluated by comparing the maximum pressure loading with those by the CFD prediction. It was found that the relative errors are less than 0.1% for both the projectile and the platform with 24 resultant sample points. It was also found that the escaping velocity and the freestream velocity significantly affect the characteristics of the surficial pressure loading due to the rotational disturbance around the projectile.},

In the present study, the reservoir temperature determination in a shock tube using the ultraviolet emission spectra of hydroxyl radical (OH) A-X band was carried out. A radiation model for the OH A-X transition was developed, and it was validated using the benchmark data. Curve fit parameters, such as a peak-to-peak ratio and the absolute peak intensity of the P-branch, are proposed to evaluate the rotational temperature and the OH number density from the measured emission spectra. In the shock tube experiments, humid air from the atmosphere was employed as a test gas, and a small amount of the ultraviolet OH emission was measured behind the reflected shock wave. The measured spectrum was converted to the rotational temperature and the number density using the present model of the OH A-X emission. Then, the evaluated rotational temperature was compared with the calculated values of the reservoir condition behind the reflected shock wave. A good agreement was detected between the measured and the calculated temperatures, which are 4020 ± 290 K and 4110 ± 220 K, respectively. It was recognized that the reservoir temperature behind the reflected shock wave is well described by the present model of the OH A-X ultraviolet emission.},

In the radiation calculations, a line-by-line method with the non-Boltzmann electronic populations is employed by adopting the quasi-steady state approach of the electronic master equation calculations. In constructing the electronic master equation, the best set of the electron and heavy-particle impact excitation rates is proposed to achieve better agreement with the measured radiative heating flight data. In the flow-radiation coupling procedure, the effect of the non-local absorption is modeled by devising an iterative process between the quasi-steady state electronic master equation and the radiative transfer equation calculations. Escape factors of the strongest atomic lines and the diatomic nitrogen vacuum ultraviolet systems with the non-local absorption effect are also proposed to more efficiently consider the non-local nature of the radiative transition.

The ν 3 band emission at 4.3 µm is detected using an optical band-pass filter and a mercury cadmium telluride detector. A conversion methodology is introduced that calculates the detector voltage from the spectral radiance considering the spectral sensitivities of the optical components and the non-linear characteristics of the detector. Two radiation models, a line-by-line model and a random statistical narrow band model, are employed to calculate the spectral radiance at given flow conditions. Black body radiation is considered for radiance calculation for optically thick conditions. Temperatures under test conditions in a shock tube are determined using the proposed conversion methodology and are compared with the temperatures obtained from a computational fluid dynamics simulation. The accuracy and efficiency of the temperature measurement using the two radiation models and the black body curve are compared. It is confirmed that the proposed method is a reliable way to determine the temperature while using a relatively simple experimental setup. Detector voltages are presented for a wide range of temperature, pressure, and beam path length for applications under different test conditions.},

 abstract = {Owing to its superior chemical stability at high temperatures, carbon is attractive as a candidate for ablation thermal protection system (TPS) materials for hypersonic re-entry vehicles. The catalytic recombination behavior is crucial to the ablation process during atmospheric entry because it provokes considerable heat flux at the surface. In the present study, catalytic efficiency values for oxygen and nitrogen recombination on carbon material have been determined by reflected shock experiments that can replicate the flow behavior of a hypersonic stagnation-point blunt body. Dissociated oxygen and nitrogen atoms were adequately produced adjacent to the shock tube endwall. Typical thin-film gauges coated with carbon are used for the stagnation heat-transfer measurements at the endwall. Before and after the tests, the properties of carbon were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Surface heat-transfer data were analyzed with catalytic heat-transfer theories. The role of recombination efficiency on the species mass fraction is also investigated by solving the governing equation for species conservation. The recombination efficiencies of carbon are found to be 0.0023 and 0.00075 for oxygen and nitrogen, respectively. It has been shown that the carbon surface is more catalytically active towards oxygen atoms than nitrogen atoms.},

A novel atomistic quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) method with a modified approach is devised to drastically reduce computational cost, and rigorously model the rotational relaxation time of N2 in N2–N and N2–N2 collisions. The calculated full sets of rotational state-to-state transition rates obtained by the QCT method are fed into the rotational state-resolved master equations to determine the rotational relaxation time of N2. Clear discrepancies are observed when the present rotational relaxation time is compared with existing empirical data for N2. The existing empirical model is utilized to determine the rotational relaxation time of other atmospheric gas species. Then the present set of rotational relaxation times for the air mixture is employed to predict the hypersonic shock standoff distance over a blunt body of the ground and flight experiments. Compared with the results from the two-temperature model, the rotational nonequilibrium enlarges the hypersonic shock standoff distance. This increase in shock standoff distance by the rotational nonequilibrium is attributed to the delay in chemical reactions inside the shock layers. The accuracy of the predicted measured shock standoff distance is improved by considering the present rotational relaxation time of the air mixture.},

To discretize a solid angle as uniformly as possible, mutually repulsive particles on the unit sphere were introduced and directly used as radiation directions. To assess the uniformity of the radiation direction distributions of the RPAD and the other angular discretization methods, the minimum distances between control angles were compared. The assessment shows that the radiation direction distribution of the RPAD is the most uniform. The RPAD also achieved the most accurate first moment integral over the half solid angle. To assess various angular discretization methods including the RPAD in the three-dimensional spatial domain, they were adopted to solve two benchmark problems. The first benchmark problem is analysis of a cylindrical enclosure fill with a purely absorbing and emitting medium. In this problem, although the maximum radiative flux errors from the FTn$$_n$$ FVM, IUSD, and RPAD were relatively similar, it was observed that the flux by the RPAD exhibits the least fluctuation for the varying surface direction with respect to the coordinate system. As a second benchmark problem, the rocket plume base heating was analyzed to assess the angular discretization methods in terms of pure scattering. It was observed that the maximum errors were smallest for the IUSD or RPAD, followed by the FTn$$_n$$ FVM. However, the IUSD shows a relatively inaccurate radiative flux for a particular number of radiation directions. It was found that the RPAD proposed in the present study provides comparable or more accurate solutions for the three-dimensional RTE than the other angular discretization methods tested.},

As a preliminary approach, generic multi-temperature model is employed by decomposing vibrational energy modes of polyatomic species from the electron-electronic-vibration energy pool. The sample radiation spectra from mixture are presented to show a possibility of strong contribution from vacuum ultraviolet regime, in addition to the well-known contributions from CN Violet and Red. As a future investigation, results from a self-consistent CR model coupled with flow field and radiative transport will be presented. Based on the modeling framework, detailed sensitivity analysis will also be carried out to quantify level of uncertainty relevant to aerothermodynamic heating around Titan atmospheric entry vehicles.},

 abstract = {Understanding the kinetics of the HCN system is critical to several disciplines in science and engineering, including interstellar chemistry, atmospheric reentry, and combustion, to name a few. This paper constructs a rovibrational state-specific kinetic mechanism for the HCN system, leveraging electronic structure calculations, classical scattering dynamics, and state-to-state kinetics. To this aim, three accurate potential energy surfaces (PESs), <sup>1</sup><i>A</i>', <sup>3</sup><i>A</i>', and <sup>3</sup><i>A</i>″, are constructed using multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) calculations for a comprehensive arrangement of the nuclei. Quasi-classical scattering calculations provide elementary reaction rate constants resulting from the interaction between the CN, CH, and NH molecules with H, N, and C atoms, respectively. The rovibrational collisional model developed comprises 50 million bound-bound and free-bound collisional processes. This model is used to study the dynamics of energy transfer and dissociation in an isochoric and isothermal chemical reactor <i>via</i> the solution of the master equation for a wide temperature range from 1000 to 10,000 K. This study unravels the dynamics of dissociation of the molecules in the HCN system, which the PESs primarily control <i>via</i> the formation of short-lived intermediates that shortcut the dissociation pathway. The exchange processes in CH and NH enhance the dissociation by over 80%. The importance of exchange processes is also highlighted in comparing the quasi-steady state and thermal dissociation rates with state-of-the-art rate models and experimental fits.},

bimolecular collisions, the internal states of the collision partner are
assumed to follow a Boltzmann distribution at a prescribed internal
temperature. This procedure makes the problem tractable, reducing the
computational cost to a comparable scale with the $\text{O}_2$+O system. The
constructed rovibrational-specific kinetic database covers the temperature
range of 7500-20000 K. The analysis of the energy transfer and dissociation
process in isochoric and isothermal conditions reveals that significant
departures from the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution occur during the energy
transfer and dissociation phase. Comparing the population distribution of the
$\text{O}_2$ molecules against the $\text{O}_2$+O demonstrates a more
significant extent of non-equilibrium characterized by a more diffuse
distribution whereby the vibrational strands are more clearly identifiable.
This is partly due to a less efficient mixing of the rovibrational states,
which results in more diffuse rovibrational distributions in the
quasi-steady-state distribution. The master equation analysis for the combined
$\text{O}_3$+$\text{O}_4$ system reveals that the $\text{O}_2$+$\text{O}_2$

control of the dissociation dynamics. The findings will provide strong physical
foundations for future development of oxygen chemistry.},

@article{pub.1164676156,
 abstract = {This work presents a vibrational and electronic state-to-state model for
nitrogen plasma implemented within a multi-physics modular computational
framework to study non-equilibrium effects in inductively coupled plasma (ICP)
discharges. Within the computational framework, the set of vibronic (i.e.,
vibrational and electronic) master equations are solved in a tightly coupled
fashion with the flow governing equations. This tight coupling eliminates the
need for invoking any simplifying assumptions when computing the state of the
plasma, thereby ensuring a higher degree of physical fidelity. To mitigate
computational complexity, a maximum entropy coarse-graining strategy is
deployed, effectively truncating the internal state space. The efficacy of this
reduced StS model is empirically substantiated through zero-dimensional
isochoric simulations. In these simulations, the results obtained from the
reduced-order model are rigorously compared against those obtained from the
full StS model, thereby confirming the accuracy of the reduced StS framework.
The developed Coarse-grained StS model was employed to study the plasma
discharge within the VKI Plasmatron facility. Our results reveal pronounced
discrepancies between the plasma flow fields obtained from StS simulations and
those derived from Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) models, which are
conventionally used in the simulation of such facilities. The analysis
demonstrates a substantial departure of the internal state populations of atoms
and molecules from the Boltzmann distribution. These nonequilibrium effects
have important consequences on the energy coupling dynamics, thereby impacting
the overall morphology of the plasma discharge. A deeper analysis of the
results demonstrates that the population distribution is in a
Quasi-Steady-State in the hot plasma core.},

 abstract = {This paper provides a comparison between the vibrational-specific
state-to-state (StS) model for nitrogen plasma elaborated in Part I of this
work and conventional two-temperature (2-T) models for simulating inductively
coupled plasma (ICP) discharges under non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium
(NLTE) conditions. Simulations are performed within the multi-physics
computational framework established for ICP in Part I. Based on the findings of
Part I, the quasi-steady-state (QSS) assumption is validated in the plasma
core, thereby enabling the calculation of global rate coefficients under this
assumption. This facilitates the reduction of the StS model to a "consistent"
macroscopic 2-T model. Results from the StS model for nitrogen ICP torch
exhibit considerable discrepancies when compared against predictions from the
widely utilized Park 2-T model. On the contrary, the comparison between the
newly proposed 2-T model, consistently derived from the original vibronic StS
model, and the full StS results demonstrate excellent agreement in terms of
plasma core location, morphology, and peak temperature distributions. This
demonstrates the ability of the proposed 2-T model to capture the energy
transfer and reactive processes predicted by the comprehensive StS model.
Additionally, the study identifies the vibrational-translational (VT) energy
transfer term in the 2-T model as the predominant factor in dictating plasma
core morphology. This suggests a strong sensitivity of the ICP flow field to
heavy-impact vibrational excitations and dissociative events.},
