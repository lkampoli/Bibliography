 abstract = {We study the process of resonant charge exchange involving excited helium atoms with the principal quantum number n = 5 colliding with the helium ion in the ground state in the collision energy range from thermal up to 10 eV. This information may be important for the analysis of planet atmospheres containing helium, in particular, for Jupiter’s atmosphere, but our basic interest is the transition from the quantum to classical description of this process, where, due to large cross sections, evaluations of the cross sections are possible. For the chosen process, quantum theory allows determining the cross section as a result of a tunnel electron transition, while classical theory accounts for over-barrier electron transitions. The classical theory additionally requires effective transitions between states with close energies. The analysis of these transitions for helium with n = 5 shows that electron momenta and their projections are mixed for a part of the states, while for other states, the mixing is absent. A simple criterion to separate such states is given. In addition, the main contribution to the cross section of resonant charge exchange follows from tunnel electron transitions. As a result, the quantum theory is better for calculating the cross sections of resonant charge exchange than the classical one and also allows finding the partial cross sections of resonant charge exchange, while the classical approach gives the cross section of resonant charge exchange in a simple manner with the accuracy of 20%.},

It is shown that the plasma optical thickness plays a major role on the evolution of macroscopic quantities and internal distributions along the nozzle axis. Structured electron energy distribution functions, characterized by long plateaux and humps, are created due to superelastic collisions of cold electrons and electronically excited atomic hydrogen. The magnitudes of the plateaux are orders of magnitude higher in an optically thick plasma compared with a thin plasma, while the electron-electron collisions play a role in smoothing the peaks created by superelastic collisions between cold electrons and H(n>2).},

 abstract = {IntroductionThe research on high-energy shock wave is a field of large interest including nuclear explosion, hypersonic flows as well as laser forming plasmas. During the relevant interaction a high-temperature, high-pressure plasma is formed, which in some cases can be ascribed to the family of thermal plasmas, characterized by equilibrium between the different degrees of freedom, including chemical and internal ones. Thermal plasmas can be described by equilibrium chemical thermodynamics, in particular statistical thermodynamics is used in this field to get information about the input data (entropy, enthalpy and specific heat of single species). Thermal plasmas are usually characterized by a single temperature for all species, including the vibrationally, rotationally and electronically distributions among the excited states, while dissociation and ionization (Saha) equilibria characterize them. On the other hand thermal plasmas with different temperatures are still accepted in this kind of literature, the different temperatures characterizing the corresponding reservoirs of energy. The internal distributions are still Boltzmann at a given (different) temperature; chemical equilibrium thermodynamics again characterizes the plasma properties even though caution must be exercised in using it. Typical conditions for thermal plasmas are temperatures in the range of 5 000-50 000 K, pressure in the 10− 2-103 atm. range and ionization degree larger than 10− 5.},

Superelastic vibrational collisions play an important role in affecting the electron energy distribution function (eedf) in a wide range of the reduced electric field E/N and of vibrational temperatures characterizing the vibrational modes of CO2. An important result is the dependence of fractional power losses and of the relevant rate coefficients on the vibrational temperatures of the system. Superelastic electronic collisions, on the other hand, are the main processes affecting eedf and related quantities in the post discharge conditions (i.e., E/N = 0). In particular at low vibrational temperatures, the superelastic electronic collisions form an important plateau in the eedf, largely influencing the rate coefficients and the fractional power transfer.},

Thermodynamic functions have been calculated modelling in different ways the electronic levels of atomic species (ground-state, Debye–Hückel and confined-atom approximations). Frozen and reactive specific heats as well as isentropic coefficients are strongly affected by the electronic excitation whereas compensation effects smooth its influence on the total specific heat, i.e. the sum of frozen and reactive contributions. Higher-order approximations of the Chapman–Enskog method have been used to evaluate transport coefficients, including electronically excited states as separate species. The importance of a state-to-state approach to calculate transport coefficients is presented taking into account the strong dependence of transport cross sections on the principal quantum number.

 abstract = {The modeling of atmospheric gas, interacting with the space vehicles in re-entry conditions in planetary exploration missions, requires a large set of scattering data for all those elementary processes occurring in the system. A fundamental aspect of re-entry problems is represented by the strong non-equilibrium conditions met in the atmospheric plasma close to the surface of the thermal shield, where numerous interconnected relaxation processes determine the evolution of the gaseous system towards equilibrium conditions. A central role is played by the vibrational exchanges of energy, so that collisional processes involving vibrationally excited molecules assume a particular importance. In the present paper, theoretical calculations of complete sets of vibrationally state-resolved cross sections and rate coefficients are reviewed, focusing on the relevant classes of collisional processes: resonant and non-resonant electron-impact excitation of molecules, atom–diatom and molecule–molecule collisions as well as gas-surface interaction. In particular, collisional processes involving atomic and molecular species, relevant to Earth (N2, O2, NO), Mars (CO2, CO, N2) and Jupiter (H2, He) atmospheres are considered.},

 abstract = {Abstract
The evolution of atmospheric pressure hydrogen plasma under the action of repetitively ns electrical pulse has been investigated using a 0D state-to-state kinetic model that self-consistently couples the master equation of heavy particles and the Boltzmann equation for free electrons. The kinetic model includes, together with atomic hydrogen states and the vibrational kinetics of H2 ground state, vibrational levels of singlet states, accounting for the collisional quenching, having a relevant role because of the high pressure. The mechanisms of excitations, radiative decay and collisional quenching involving the excited H2 states and the corresponding cross sections, integrated over the non-equilibrium electron energy distribution function (EEDF) to obtain kinetic rates, are discussed in the light of the kinetic simulation results, i.e. the time evolution during the pulse of the plasma composition, of the EEDF and of the vibrational distributions of ground and singlet excited states.

 abstract = {The non-equilibrium vibrational distributions and electron energy distributions of CO in nanosecond repetitively pulsed discharges and afterglows have been determined from a coupled solution of the time-dependent Boltzmann equation for the electron energy distribution function (eedf) of free electrons, the master equations for vibrational levels of CO and the electronic excited states of CO, O and C atoms. The optically thick plasma conditions have been investigated in a companion paper (part I), while in the present paper we also show the results obtained by allowing radiative emission processes (optically thin plasma) as well as electronic excited state collisional quenching processes. Two case studies, which differ for the duration of the afterglow following each pulse (1 μs and 25 μs case studies) are discussed, and each pulse is characterized by a time-dependent electric field profile in the range 0–20 ns. The results, which depend on the number of pulses considered in the discharge and the corresponding afterglow duration, show several peaks in the eedf due to super-elastic electronic collisions. On the other hand, the quenching process of the a 3Π electronic state of CO determines the pumping of vibrational quanta in the v = 27 level, which in turn largely modifies the vibrational distribution function (vdf) of CO. As a consequence, the quenching of the a 3Π state increases the reactivity of CO through the Boudouard reaction, and under given conditions, this channel can become more important than the dissociation rates by electron impact collisions.},

Maxwellian rate coefficients for the corresponding bound−to−bound and bound−to−continuum transitions are presented in the temperature range of 0.1–10 000 eV.

The virtual experiments reproduce the conditions of an experiment in the literature, showing the predictive character of the present approach and validating the model. The sensitivity of the results to the selected database of cross-sections for the electron impact-induced processes is investigated, clarifying the impact of more accurate datasets for specific processes in the mechanisms of negative ion production.},

@article{pub.1165706231,
 abstract = {This study concerns the importance of the precursor (or pre-reactive) state of elementary physicochemical processes whose basic features, as structure, stability, and trapping effect of reagents, are controlled by the balance of intermolecular forces that arise at long range and operate at intermediate and short separation distances. The detailed formulation of such forces, determining formation probability and dynamical evolution of the precursor state, is of relevance in molecular science and difficult to be treated by quantum chemistry. Such a problem has been tackled by us exploiting the phenomenological approach, which employs semi-empirical and empirical formulas to represent strength, range and angular dependence of the leading interaction components involved. In addition to the study of transport phenomena, part of the attention is addressed to chemi-ionization (or Penning ionization) reactions for which neutral reagents lead to atomic and/or molecular ions plus electrons as products. Chemi-ionizations are bimolecular processes occurring in several environments of interest, where a reagent is a species, formed in excited-metastable electronic states by collisions with energetic electrons or cosmic rays. For such reactions all crucial electronic rearrangements, affecting stability and evolution of the weakly bound precursor state, here coincident with the reaction transition state, are characterized with a high detail. The results of the present study are of interest for many other processes, whose precursor states and their relevant features are difficult to characterize, often masked by several other effects.Graphical abstract},
