 abstract = {Recent advances in fullerene science and technology suggest that it may be possible, in the distant future, to design and build atomically precise programmable machines composed largely of functionalized fullerenes. Large numbers of such machines with appropriate interconnections could conceivably create a material able to react to the environment and repair itself. This paper reviews some of the experimental and theoretical work relating to these materials, sometimes called machine phase, including the fullerene gears and high-density memory recently designed and simulated in our laboratory.},

 abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of water droplets on graphite are carried out to determine the contact angle for different water–carbon potential functions. Following the procedure of Werder et al. [J. Phys. Chem. B, 107 (2003) 1345], the C–O Lennard–Jones well depth is varied to recover the experimental value for the contact angle using a 2000-molecule water droplet and compensating for the line tension effect that lowers the contact angle for increasing droplet size. For the discrete graphite surface model studied by Werder et al., the effects of adding C–H Lennard–Jones interactions and changing the long-range cut-off distance are considered. In addition, a continuum graphite surface model is studied for which the water–graphite interaction energy depends only on the normal distance (z) from the water oxygen to the surface. This new model, with z -10 repulsion and z -4 attraction, is formulated in terms of the standard Lennard–Jones parameters, for which the recommended values are sgr CO=3.19 Å and ε CO=0.3651 kJ/mol.},

 abstract = {The relaxation of N₂(X¹Σg⁺) molecules in a background gas composed of N((4)S(u)) atoms and free electrons is studied by using an ideal isochoric and isothermic chemical reactor. A rovibrational state-to-state model is developed to study energy transfer process induced by free electron and atomic collisions. The required cross sections and the corresponding rate coefficients are taken from two well-known kinetic databases: NASA Ames kinetic mechanism for the description of the N₂(X¹Σg⁺)-N((4)S(u)) processes and the Phys4Entry database for the electron driven processes, N₂(X¹Σg⁺)-e(-). The evolution of the population densities of each individual rovibrational level is explicitly determined via the numerical solution of the master equation for temperatures ranging from 10000 to 30,000 K. It was found that the distribution of the rovibrational energy levels of N₂(X¹Σg⁺) is strongly influenced by the electron driven collisional processes, which promote the excitation of the low lying vibrational levels. The macroscopic vibrational energy relaxation is governed by the molecule-atom collisions, when free electrons, initially cold are relaxing to the final heat-bath temperature. Thus, the main role of the free electrons is to ensure the equilibration of vibrational and free electron excitation, thus validating the existence of the local equilibrium T(V)-T(e). However, if electrons and heavy particles are assumed to be in equilibrium at the heat bath temperature, electron driven processes dominate the vibrational relaxation. Finally, we have assessed the validity of the Landau-Teller model for the description of the inelastic energy transfer between molecules and free electrons. In the case of free-electron temperatures lower than 10,000 K, Landau-Teller relaxation model gives an accurate description of the vibrational relaxation, while at higher temperatures the error in the predictions can be significant and the model should not be used.},

 abstract = {We perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the hydrophobic–hydrophilic behavior of pairs of C60 fullerene molecules and single wall carbon nanotubes in water. The interaction potentials involve a fully atomistic description of the fullerenes or carbon nanotubes and the water is modeled using the flexible SPC model. Both unconstrained and constrained MD simulations are carried out. We find that these systems display drying, as evidenced by expulsion of the interstitial water, when the C60 and carbon nanotubes are separated by less than 12, and 9–10 Å, respectively. From the constrained simulations, the computed mean force between two carbon nanotubes in water exhibits a maximum at a tube spacing of 5.0 Å which corresponds to approximately one unstable layer of interstitial water molecules. The main contribution to the force stems from the van der Waals attraction between the carbon surfaces. The minimum in the potential of mean force has a value of −17 kJmol−1Å−1 at a tube spacing of 3.5 Å.},

 abstract = {A rovibrational collisional coarse-grain model has been developed to reduce a detailed mechanism for the internal energy excitation and dissociation processes behind a strong shockwave in a nitrogen flow. The rovibrational energy levels of the electronic ground state of the nitrogen molecule were lumped into a smaller number of bins. The reaction rate coefficients of an ab initio database developed at NASA Ames Research Center were averaged for each bin based on a uniform distribution of the energy levels within the bin. The results were obtained by coupling the Master equation for the reduced mechanism with a one-dimensional flow solver for conditions expected for reentry into Earth’s atmosphere at 10km/s. The coarse-grain collisional model developed allow us to describe accurately the internal energy relaxation and dissociation processes based on a smaller number of equations, as opposed to existing reduced models assuming thermal equilibrium between the rotational and translational energy modes.},

Brenner's reactive hydrocarbon potential is used to model interatomic forces within each molecular gear. A Lennard - Jones 6 - 12 potential or the Buckingham  potential plus electrostatic interaction terms are used for intermolecular interactions between gears. A number of gear and gear/shaft configurations are simulated on parallel computers. One gear is powered by forcing the atoms near the end of the nanotube to rotate, and a second gear is allowed to rotate by keeping the atoms near the end of its nanotube constrained to a cylinder. The meshing aromatic gear teeth transfer angular momentum from the powered gear to the driven gear. Results suggest that these gears can operate at up to 50 - 100 GHz in a vacuum at room temperature. The failure mode involves tooth slip, not bond breaking, so failed gears can be returned to operation by lowering the temperature and/or rotation rate.},

 abstract = {Abstract  Ab initio and molecular mechanics studies of LiPF 6 and the interaction of the salt with the poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) oligomer dimethylether have been performed. Optimized geometries and energies of Li + /PF 6 − complexes obtained from quantum chemistry revealed a preference for C 3V symmetry structures for Li + –P separations under 2.8 Å, C 2V symmetry for Li + –P in the range of 2.8–3.3 Å and C 4V symmetry for Li + –P separations larger than 3.3 Å. Electron correlation effects were found to make an insignificant contribution to binding in the Li + /PF 6 − complex. By contrast, analogous studies of PF 6 − /PF 6 − and PF 6 − /dimethyl ether complexes revealed important contributions of electron correlation to the complex interaction energy. A molecular mechanics force field for simulations of PEO/LiPF 6 melts was parameterized to reproduce the geometries and energies of Li + /PF 6 − , PF 6 − /PF 6 − , PF 6 − /dimethylether complexes. Molecular dynamics simulations of PEO/LiPF 6 melts were performed to validate this quantum chemistry‐based force field. Accurate reproduction of the increase in solution density with addition of salt was found while the electrical conductivity of PEO/LiPF 6 solutions was found to be within an order of magnitude of the experimental values. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

@article{pub.1024680602,
 abstract = {We have re-examined the prospects of HOCl as an inert reservoir for atmospheric chlorine in the light of new theoretical calculations and available experimental measurements of its photodissociation cross-sections. The theoretical calculations and most recent laboratory studies imply that the broad maxima 3200 Å observed in two other experimental spectra may not belong to HOCl. On the basis of this implication HOCl could have a long lifetime against photodissociation in the stratosphere, and could, thereby, become a reservoir for atmospheric chlorine comparable to ClONO2 or even HCl. In this capacity HOCl could reduce the predicted ozone destruction due to any given level of total chlorine burden. We have also examined the difficulties in laboratory measurements of the HOCl absorption spectrum with particular emphasis on identifying the impurities which may be present in the experimental system. It appears that specialized new experiments are needed to clearly establish the nature and strength of HOCl absorption in the neighbourhood of 3200 Å. Some refinements in the theoretical calculations also seem desirable. In view of the difficulties involved in the laboratory determination of HOCl photodissociation cross-sections, it is suggested that a search for possible stratospheric HOCl by atmospheric spectroscopists would be worthwhile.},

The rate coefficients for rovibrational dissociation and excitation are provided by two chemical databases for the N + N2 system recently developed at NASA Ames Research Center and the University of Bari. Vibrationally averaged rate coefficients for N + N2 collisions are computed based on the hypothesis of equilibrium between translational and rotational modes. N2 + N2 collisions are also considered based on literature data. Inviscid and quasi 1D governing equations are discretized in space by means of a finite volume method. A fully implicit time integration method is applied to obtain steady state solutions. Results show that, for both N + N2 and N2 + N2 collision dominated flows, the populations of vibrational levels deviate from a Boltzmann distribution. An accurate investigation of vibrational level dynamics shows the different behavior of low and high-lying states. Comparison against experimental data acquired at the EAST facility of NASA Ames Research Center demonstrate good agreement between the computed and experimental results.},

 abstract = {A systematic molecular dynamics study shows that the contact angle of a water droplet on graphite changes significantly as a function of the water−carbon interaction energy. Together with the observation that a linear relationship can be established between the contact angle and the water monomer binding energy on graphite, a new route to calibrate interaction potential parameters is presented. Through a variation of the droplet size in the range from 1000 to 17 500 water molecules, we determine the line tension to be positive and on the order of 2 × 10-10 J/m. To recover a macroscopic contact angle of 86°, a water monomer binding energy of −6.33 kJ mol-1 is required, which is obtained by applying a carbon−oxygen Lennard-Jones potential with the parameters εCO = 0.392 kJ mol-1 and σCO = 3.19 Å. For this new water−carbon interaction potential, we present density profiles and hydrogen bond distributions for a water droplet on graphite.},

 abstract = {Results are presented from theoretical and experimental infrared (IR) spectroscopy studies of the microstructures of poly(silsesquioxane)s (PSSQs) of varying chemical composition. The calculated IR spectra show two distinct asymmetric Si−O−Si stretch vibration bands for models of complete polyhedral cages, incomplete open cages, and short ladder structures. Close analyses of the calculated results indicate that the higher frequency IR band at about 1150 cm−1 is derived from the parallel asymmetric Si−O−Si stretch vibration mode in the (Si−O) n ring subunit while the lower frequency band at about 1050 cm−1 is due to the asymmetric Si−O−Si stretch symmetric with respect to the inversion point at the center of the (Si−O) n ring and is absent in highly symmetric cage structures. Experimentally, poly(methylsilsesquioxane) (PMSQ), poly(isobutylsilsesquioxane) (PiBSQ), and poly(phenylsilsesquioxane) (PPhSQ) exhibit a varying tendency of cage-like structures, rather than ladder structures, in as-polymerized samples. When the thermal conversion (curing) temperature is increased to 400 °C, the microstructure of PMSQ in thin solid films transforms from open cage-like structure toward a random network with lower symmetry. This change in microstructure is caused by the secondary condensation reaction and the evaporation of cage structures, and the effect of cage evaporation becomes most pronounced for PiBSQ films, which are mostly comprised of cage-like structures that evaporate around 280 °C. In comparison, PPhSQ films retain cage-like structure upon curing to 400 °C as a result of the high evaporation temperature (ca. 500 °C) of the cages.},

As model fluid impurities we consider aqueous solutions of potassium–chloride with molar concentrations up to 1.8 M. Quantum chemistry calculations are performed to derive pair potentials for the ion–graphite interactions. The contact angle is found to decrease weakly with increasing ionic concentration, from 90° at 0 M to 81° at 1.8 M concentration. The influence of solid impurities is found to be more significant.

Using the calibrated force field, we conduct MD simulations to study the interface between a hydrophilic silica substrate and water surrounded by air at different pressures. We find that the static water contact angle is independent of the air pressure imposed on the system. Our simulations reveal the presence of a nanometer thick layer of gas at the water–silica interface.

This reaction is an important step in the chlorine-catalyzed destruction of ozone which is thought to occur in the stratosphere. Rate constants have been calculated for temperatures between 220 and 1000 K. The calculated rate constant is 4.36 × 10−11 exp(−191/T) cm3 molecule−1s−1. Its value at 300 K is(2.3 ± 0.2) × 1011 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, which is within a factor of two of the recent experimental measurements. The calculated activation energy of 0.38 kcal/mole is in excellent agreement with the experimental value of 0.44 kcal/mole determined by Clyne and Nip and provides support for their measurements. The calculations were performed using both the quasi-classical and phase space trajectory sampling methods. The empirical potential energy surface used in the calculations was constructed to fit experimental data for ClO, O2 and ClOO molecules. Other important features of this potential surface, such as the barrier to reaction, were varied systematically and calculations were performed for a range of conditions to determine the “best” theoretical rate constants. The present results demonstrate how classical trajectory methods can be applied to the determination of activation energies and other kinetic data for important atmospheric reactions.},

When the 300°K cross sections are convolved with a Gaussian function of 2 Å bandwidth, a maximum of 10.6 mb is observed at 277.4 nm, corresponding to the band head of the v″ = 0 to v′ = 11 transition. To calculate effective rate constants for predissociation of the A2Π32 state of ClO at altitudes ranging from 20 to 50km, the absorption cross sections were combined with estimates of the solar flux that penetrates to each altitude. The rate of predissociation is calculated to be much greater than the rate of direct photodissociation, but the former is still small compared to the loss rate of ClO caused by reactions with NO and O. Therefore, the contribution of predissociation to the destruction of ClO accounts for at most 2% of the total ClO loss. Further, calculations with a simplified chemical model indicate that the effect of ClO predissociation is to lower the rate of ozone depletion at all altitudes by a maximum of only 1%.},

 abstract = {Dielectric insulator materials containing nanometer-scale closed-cell pores with low dielectric constants (k < 2.2), good mechanical properties, and high dielectric breakdown strengths are required for future semiconductor devices. In this paper we present a novel method for preparing nanoporous polyorganosilicate films, which promise to satisfy the key requirements, via inorganic/organic polymer hybrid templating. The nanometer-scale inorganic/organic polymer hybrids are generated in situ upon heating mixtures of methylsilsesquioxane (MSSQ) prepolymer with star-shaped hydroxy-terminated poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) to ∼250 °C, causing chain extension and cross-linking of MSSQ. Subsequent heating to 430 °C results in the thermal decomposition and volatilization of PCL components from the vitrified poly(methylsilsesquioxane) (PMSSQ) matrix, leaving behind porous PMSSQ films with pores with the size and shape of the original hybrid morphology. A dielectric constant as low as 2.1 has been achieved for closed-cell nanoporous PMSSQ films with hydrophobic surfaces and excellent breakdown strengths close to that of SiO2. Moreover, conductance measurements on inorganic/organic polymer hybrids offer insight into the development of interconnected PCL domains as the PCL content is increased above ∼25%.},

The impetus for this work is to help resolve large discrepancies existing between literature measurements of the formation enthalpy Delta(f)H degrees (298) for exo-THDCPD. We find that use of the isodesmic bond separation reaction C(10)H(16) + 14CH(4) --> 12C(2)H(6) yields results for the exo isomer (JP10) in between the two experimentally accepted values, for the composite methods G3(MP2), G3(MP2)//B3LYP, and CBS-QB3. Application of this same isodesmic bond separation scheme to gas-phase adamantane yields a value for Delta(f)H degrees (298) within 5 kJ/mol of experiment. Isodesmic bond separation calculations for the endo isomer give a heat of formation in excellent agreement with the experimental measurement. Combining our calculated values for the gas-phase heat of formation with recent measurements of the heat of vaporization yields recommended values for Delta(f)H degrees (298)liq of -126.4 and -114.7 kJ/mol for the exo and endo isomers, respectively.},

 abstract = {We have conducted a density functional theory (DFT) investigation of zincate species. The accuracy of the DFT/B3LYP method and the adequacy of the atomic basis sets employed were established through investigation of the ionization potentials of Zn, the geometry and bond energy of ZnO, and the geometries and energies of selected Zn−OH and Zn−H2O complexes. Our investigation revealed that the [Zn(OH)]+, Zn(OH)2, and [Zn(OH)3]- zincate complexes are stable in the gas phase. However, we found that dissociated [Zn(OH)3]- + OH- is more stable than [Zn(OH)4]2- in the gas phase and that the gas-phase geometry of [Zn(OH)4]2- differs significantly from that gleaned from experimental studies of aqueous KOH/zincate solutions. We also investigated zincate complexes involving molecular water and K+ cations in order to better understand the influence of condensed phase effects in aqueous KOH solutions on the stability and geometry of the zincate complexes. We found that water does not significantly influence complex binding energies or the geometries of the underlying [Zn(OH) n ]2-n complexes for n = 1, 2, and 3. In contrast, for [Zn(OH)4]2- the introduction of water strongly stabilizes the complex relative to the gas phase and results in a structure close to that observed experimentally. We were unable to find a stable [Zn(OH)4(H2O)2]2- complex with a planar Zn(OH)4 arrangement and close Zn−H2O coordination, corresponding to a Zn−O coordination of number of six, as has been suggested in some interpretations of experiments. We found through investigation of the K2Zn(OH)4 complex that K+ cations are also effective in engendering a structure that is very close to experiment and that K+ ions are even more strongly bound to the [Zn(OH)4]2- complex than water. Finally, we determined the structure and stability of [ZnO(OH)2]2-(oxodihydroxozincate), a species that has been hypothesized to be important in water-poor zincates solutions.},

 abstract = {We study the structural properties of water surrounding a carbon nanotube using molecular dynamics simulations. The interaction potentials involve a description of the carbon nanotube using Morse, harmonic bending, torsion, and Lennard-Jones potentials. The water is described by the flexible Simple Point Charge (SPC) model by Teleman et al., and the carbon−water interactions include a carbon−oxygen Lennard-Jones potential, and an electrostatic quadrupole moment acting between the carbon atoms and the charge sites of the water. Vibration of the breathing mode of the carbon nanotube in water is inferred from the oscillations in carbon−carbon van der Waals energy, and the inverse proportionality between the radius of the carbon nanotube and the breathing frequency is in good agreement with experimental values. The results indicate, that under the present conditions, the presence of the water has a negligible influence on the breathing frequency. The water at the carbon−water interface is found to have a HOH plane nearly tangential to the interface, and the water radial density profile exhibits the characteristic layering also found in the graphite−water system. The average number of hydrogen bonds decreases from a value of 3.73 in the bulk phase to a value of 2.89 at the carbon−water interface. The inclusion of the carbon quadrupole moment is found to have a negligible influence on the structural properties of the water. Energy changes that occur by the process of introducing a carbon nanotube in water are calculated. The creation of a cavity in the bulk water to accommodate the nanotube constitutes the largest energy contribution. Results include an analysis of surface structure and energy values for planar and for concave cylindrical surfaces of water.},

 abstract = {The reaction of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes with molecular fluorine has been studied using B3LYP calculations. The nanotube substrates are represented by model polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that are constrained to have nonplanar geometries with curvatures corresponding to (10,10), (5,5), and (16,0) nanotubes. Most of the calculations for fullerenes are carried out for C60. The calculations are focused on the addition of one to four F-atoms to the fullerene or nanotube substrate. The preferred binding sites for sequential fluorine addition are studied along with the geometry deformations experienced by the substrate. For C60, a strong preference exists for pairwise addition to the C−C double bonds between pentagons (denoted 6/6 addition). Subsequent addition to neighboring 6/6 bonds is also favored. These results are in agreement with recent experimental data. For addition of F2 to armchair nanotubes, the favored product has the fluorine atoms bonded to adjacent carbons with an orientation perpendicular to the tube axis, whereas for zigzag nanotubes the favored orientation is parallel to the tube axis. However, in the latter case a second product with the fluorine atoms at the 1−4 positions of a hexagon, but still parallel to the tube axis, is less than 0.8 kcal/mol higher in energy. The binding energy of a pair of fluorine atoms to C60 is 115 kcal/mol, which is greater than the value found for any of the nanotube model molecules. Zigzag nanotubes are found to form more stable fluorination products than armchair tubes of comparable diameter (83 kcal/mol for (16,0) compared to 76 kcal/mol for (10,10) for addition of F2). However, smaller diameter nanotubes such as the (5,5) armchair tube have even higher binding energies (91 kcal/mol for addition of F2). For C60 and (10,10) nanotubes, addition of a second F-atom pair results in higher binding energies per F-atom than is found for the first pair. Limited calculations have been carried out to estimate the energy barriers for the fluorination process.},

The conformational energies and geometries of the important conformers of the model molecule 1,3-dimethoxypropane (DMP) were determined from ab initio electronic structure calculations. Predicted NMR vicinal coupling constants in DMP, using conformational populations determined from quantum chemical energies calculated at the MP2 level with a D95+(2df,p) basis set, are in good agreement with experimental gas phase values. The conformer energies and geometries of DMP from quantum chemistry calculations have been utilized in developing a second-order rotational isomeric state (RIS) model for poly(oxytrimethylene) (POM3). Values obtained for the first-order O−CC−C gauche energy E σ‘ (−1.0 kcal/mol) and the second-order O−CCC−O g ± g ∓ energy E ω‘‘ (4.0 kcal/mol) differ significantly from values in previous RIS models that were parametrized to reproduce experimental data on POM3 and DMP in solutions. Our model yields values for the characteristic ratio in fair agreement with experiment, but its temperature coefficient and mean-square dipole moment values are in poorer agreement than those obtained from quantum chemistry based RIS models derived for other polyethers. This discrepancy is attributed mainly to significant contributions from polymer−solvent interactions which depend on local chain conformations and the temperature dependence of such condensed phase effects in POM3 solutions.},

The force fields investigated were a united atom Lennard-Jones potential, a united atom Lennard-Jones potential with a point quadrupole, an anisotropic united atom model, and explicit (all) atom force fields with partial atomic charges and without partial atomic charges. These force fields which do not include electrostatic interactions predicted the planar sandwich structure (D 6 h ) to be the most stable dimer structure, in contrast to quantum chemistry calculations that indicate that the planar sandwich structure is a saddle point between stable parallel displaced (C 2 h ) geometries. Only the explicit atom + partial charge model predicted benzene dimer structures and energies that are in qualitative agreement with those from quantum chemistry calculations. A force field of this form for benzene is presented that accurately reproduces the gas-phase second virial coefficient of benzene and the thermodynamic properties of liquid benzene and does a reasonable job in reproducing the structure of liquid benzene and properties of benzene dimer as determined from quantum chemistry calculations.},

CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ//MP2/6-311G(2df,p) calculations yield a gauche energy in n-butane of 0.59 kcal/mol, which after correction for zero-point and thermal vibrational effects is within 0.05 kcal/mol of the values obtained from recent experiments. Calculations at the same level yield t - g and cis barrier energies in n-butane of 3.31 and 5.48 kcal/mol, respectively, supporting the traditional view that the cis barrier in n-butane is much higher than the t - g barrier. We found that torsional potential functions previously parametrized to reproduce the measured low-lying torsional vibrational transitions in the trans and gauche conformers of n-butane and which yield only a small energy difference between the barriers can be modified to reproduce both the spectroscopic data and the large quantum chemistry energy difference between barriers. For the central bond in n-hexane, the gauche energy is about 0.07 kcal/mol lower than the gauche energy in n-butane at the same level of theory. The chain length effect is greater on the barriers, with the t - g and cis barriers being about 0.5 and 0.3 kcal/mol lower, respectively, for the central bond in n-hexane compared to n-butane at the same level of theory.},

 abstract = {The geometries and energies of complexes of Li+, Cl-, and I- with methane and model ether molecules have been studied using ab initio electronic structure calculations. For Li+, a [5s3p2d] basis set which accurately describes core electrons was derived. For Cl-, basis sets as large as [8s7p4d1f] were considered, while for I- an 2sp1d ECP basis set augmented by a set of diffuse functions as large as [5sp4d1f] was employed. Calculations were performed at the SCF and MP2 levels of theory, and the effects of basis set superposition error on binding energies were considered. For the methane and ether molecules both D95** and cc-pVTZ basis sets with additional diffuse s and p functions were employed. The binding energies of Li+ to methane, dimethyl ether, and ttt 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) are found to be around 10, 40, and 40 kcal/mol, respectively. The binding energy of Li+ to tgt DME is approximately 60 kcal/mol due to the favorable interaction of Li+ with both DME oxygen atoms. The binding of Cl- and I- to dimethyl ether is much weaker, around 5−7 kcal/mol. A simple atomistic force field with two-body potential functions representing polarization effects is found to reproduce the ab initio complex energies quite well for the single ligand complexes. Polarization effects contribute significantly to the binding of Li+ to the neutral molecules, while the polarization effects in Cl- and I- complexes with dimethyl ether are relatively weak. The two-body force field accounts only partially for the decrease in binding per ligand in Li+−[O(CH3)2] n complexes with the number of ligands as observed in the quantum chemistry calculations.},

Results of these calculations are compared with those of our recent study of Li+−1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) complexes. Because of a chiral center, conformation space is more complex for DMP than for the structurally similar but achiral DME. Qualitatively similar behavior to that seen previously in studies of DME is found, however, including the presence of low-energy conformers containing consecutive gauche dihedrals of opposite sense and stronger interactions of the Li+ ion with conformers containing O-C−C-O gauche conformations. The former is a result of stabilization of conformers by attractive 1,5 CH3 ...O electrostatic interactions, while the latter reflects the ability of the ion to interact with both ether oxygen atoms. The calculated Li+−DMP complex energies and geometries reveal that favorable interactions of the α methyl group with the ion result in a Li+−t ḡt complex energy comparable that of the Li+−tgt complex. Comparison of calculated Raman spectra with experimental measurements on DMP/LiClO4 solutions indicates an increasingly high population of the t ḡt conformer with increasing salt content.},

Furthermore, basis set superposition contributions to the phenyl−phenyl interactions, estimated by extracting the phenyl rings from the optimized DPP geometries and computing the basis set superposition error for the resulting benzene dimer configurations, are significant. An atomistic molecular mechanics force field is parametrized to reproduce our best values for the conformational energies and rotational energy barriers in DPP obtained from ab initio calculations.

Surface tension was calculated from the virial equation of the pressure tensor, taking into full account of the long-range correction terms, in good agreement with experimental data. Compared with polymethylenes of the same chain length, PTFEs have larger vacuum/liquid interface thicknesses concomitant with lower surface tensions. In the surface region, the chain conformations remain unperturbed, but the chain backbone segments tend to be oriented parallel to the surface whereas the chain-end segments tend to be perpendicular to the surface. As compared with polymethylenes, the orientation of PTFE segments in the surface is found to persist deeper into the film due to the larger intermolecular orientational correlation length in PTFE melts than in polymethylene melts.},

 abstract = {An ensemble of H(CH2OCH2)12H chains has been studied by molecular dynamics simulations as both melt chains and unperturbed phantom chains as a model system to investigate condensed phase effects on chain conformations of poly(oxyethylene) (POE). In addition, conformations of high molecular weight POE chains in the melt have been determined by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments over a temperature range of 347−459 K. Our simulations show that POE chains in the melt are more extended than the phantom chains which represent the unperturbed chains in ϑ solution. Moreover, the melt chains exhibit a negative temperature coefficient of chain dimensions in contrast to a positive value for the phantom chains. The difference in chain dimensions and the difference in the temperature dependence of chain dimensions between melt and phantom chains are corroborated by the results of our SANS measurements when they are compared with experimental results for POE chains in ϑ solution. We attribute these significant deviations in conformational properties of POE chains in the melt from those of unperturbed ideal chains to condensed phase effects, similar to those found in 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), a dimer molecule of POE, from both experiments and simulations. That is, simulations show that the population of the C−C−O gt conformation is greater in melt chains than in the phantom chains, while the C−C−O g ± g ∓ populations are much smaller in the melt, the latter effect largely accounting for the more extended dimensions of the melt chains. As in DME, the conformation-dependent intermolecular polar attractions (O···H interactions, for example) account for these condensed phase effects, which become more pronounced at lower temperatures. Such intermolecular polar attractions in POE melts also result in increased interatomic packing order, but do not appear to enhance the intermolecular orientational order when compared to simulation results for polymethylene melts.},

The specific volume−temperature properties of the simulated melt systems are in excellent agreement with experiments. Conformational characteristics of PM chains in melts are identical to those of 1,5 phantom chains, characterized by short-range intramolecular interactions between the atoms separated by up to four skeletal bonds, which correspond to unperturbed chains in ϑ solvents according to recent implicit solvent model results of Sariban et al. and Destrée et al. Moreover, a Gaussian approximation of end-to-end distance distributions is found to be valid only for long PM chains with n greater than 100. According to our simulation results, the characteristic ratio C ∞ for unperturbed polyethylene chains is found to be ca. 7.9 at 413 K. This value is larger than the generally accepted value, 6.8 (derived from intrinsic viscosity data for relatively polydisperse polyethylene samples), but is corroborated by recent small angle neutron scattering results (7.8 ± 0.4) for melt chains of nearly monodisperse samples. The fact that PM chains exhibit identical conformational characteristics in melts, 1,5 phantom chains, and ϑ solvents is attributed to the lack of any correlation between local chain conformations and (polymer−polymer or polymer−solvent) intermolecular attractions. Departures from such an ideal behavior seen for other polymers are also discussed.},

In this interfacial region, a slight preference for chain segments to orient along the direction parallel to the surface is observed with practically no difference in the chain conformation from the bulk value.

The simulations find large terminal velocities of 100-400 nm/ns for imposed thermal gradients in the range of 1-3 K/nm. Moreover, the results indicate that the thermophoretic force is velocity dependent and its magnitude decreases for increasing velocity.},

A simplified theoretical model, based on the reaction coordinate concept and the calculated potential energy characteristics, was used to discuss the mechanism of the singlet–triplet transition and the energy disposal in the collision. The results obtained were that: (a) the quenching process proceeds via a collision complex mechanism; and that (b) the triplet–singlet transition occurs near the collinear geometry.

 abstract = {We have examined the structure, torsional potentials, vibrational spectra, and harmonic force fields for the s-cis and s-trans isomers of methacryloyl fluoride with the aim of understanding some of the conformational properties of these molecules and their relationship to macroscopic polymer properties. The calculations have been performed at the SCF level with a split valence basis set. We find the structure to be in reasonably good agreement with experiment and as expected find the structural variations between the two isomers to be slight. However, we do suggest a reexamination of the carbonyl geometry in light of our studies. Our calculations show the energy difference between the s-cis and the s-trans isomers to be less than 1 kcal/mol at both the split valence and the split valence polarized levels, favoring the s-trans form. An examination of the torsional potential reveals that a rigid rotor approximation provides an adequate description of the motion of either the methyl group, or of the COF moiety. For the methyl group we find a barrier of 1.5 kcal/mol, with the preferred conformation having the hydrogen atom eclipsed with respect to the carbon–carbon double bond. Our best calculations show that the torsional barrier to interconvert the s-trans to the s-cis form is 7.0 kcal/mol, somewhat higher than the recent experimental values of 6.5 and 5.1 kcal/mol. This study also points out the need to include the difference in zero point energies between reactants and the transition state when evaluating torsional potentials. Our calculated vibrational spectra show the similarities and differences between these two isomers, and suggest areas where the assignments should be further examined. In particular, we suggest that some of the low frequency torsional modes deserve further scrutiny. A fit of our data to a three term Fourier series shows that we are able to reproduce the experimentally derived barrier, even though a direct determination shows that the predicted barrier lies higher.},

 abstract = {A comprehensive first principles theoretical investigation of the gas phase reaction Ca+HF→CaF+H is reported. The overall study involves three distinct elements: (a) generation of an accurate ab initio potential energy surface for the ground electronic state of the Ca–F–H system, (b) careful fitting of the computed surface to an analytical form suitable for three-dimensional reactive scattering calculations, and (c) execution of classical trajectory calculations for Ca+HF collisions using the fitted potential surface. Ab initio potential energy calculations were performed for 175 Ca–F–H geometries using an MCSCF-CI method with a large Gaussian orbital basis set. The error in the computed endothermicity for the reaction of Ca and HF is less than 1 kcal/mol and the errors in the computed saddle point energies are believed to be less than 3 kcal/mol. The potential energy surface is dominated by a deep well corresponding to a stable linear H–Ca–F intermediate with an extremely small bending force constant. The calculations clearly demonstrate that the preferred geometry for Ca attack on HF is markedly noncollinear. The saddle point for both fluorine exchange reaction and insertion into the H–Ca–F well occurs for a Ca–F–H angle of 75° and has an energy of 16.1 kcal/mol relative to Ca+HF. The energy barrier for collinear reaction, 30.0 kcal/mol, is nearly twice as high. The analytical representation of the ab initio potential energy surface is based on a polynomial expansion in the three diatomic bond lengths that reproduces the values of the computed energies to within a root mean square deviation of 1.2 kcal/mol and reduces to the appropriate diatomic potentials in the asymptotic limits. Classical trajectory calculations for Ca+HF(v=1) utilizing the fitted surface establish the fact that the H–Ca–F potential well dominates the collision dynamics thus qualifying Ca+HF as a bona fide example of a chemical insertion reaction. Because of the extensive sampling of the H–Ca–F well, many trajectories formed rather long-lived intermediate complexes before reaching diatomic end products. A significant number of these trajectories were not converged with respect to changes in the integration time step. Despite uncertainties associated with the ultimate fates of the nonconverged trajectories, the results obtained support a number of generalizations relating to microscopic features of Ca+HF collisions. Among these are: (1) at fixed total collision energy, excitation of HF to v=1 is much more effective in promoting reaction than is placing the corresponding amount of energy in Ca,HF translation, (2) at fixed initial translational energy, reaction cross sections increase with increasing HF rotational quantum number J, (3) for trajectories which enter the H–Ca–F well, escape to form products is favored by increasing initial HF rotation and escape back to reactants is favored by increasing the initial relative translational energy, and (4) the CaF fractional product energy disposals are remarkably independent of initial collision conditions. These conclusions are compatible with the observation that significant intermode vibrational energy transfer does not occur in the H–Ca–F intermediate on the collision time scale (1–2 ps).},

Using a large [5s 5p 3d 2f 1g/4s 3p 2d] atomic natural orbital basis set, we obtain a classical barrier height of 1.86 kcal/mol at the CASSCF/multireference CI level (MRCI) after correcting for basis set superposition error and including a Davidson correction (+Q) for higher excitations. Based upon an analysis of the computed results, the true classical barrier is estimated to be about 1.4 kcal/mol. We also compute the location of the bottleneck on the lowest vibrationally adiabatic potential curve, and determine the translational energy threshold from a one-dimensional tunneling calculation. Using the difference between the calculated and experimental threshold to adjust the classical barrier height on the computed surface yields a classical barrier in the range of 1.0–1.5 kcal/mol. Combining the results of our direct estimates of the classical barrier height with the empirical values obtained from our approximate calculations of the dynamical threshold, we predict that the true classical barrier height is 1.4±0.4 kcal/mol. Arguments are presented in favor of including the relatively large (≈1 kcal/mol)+Q correction obtained when nine electrons are correlated at the CASSCF/MRCI level.},

Similar agreement is seen for the dielectric relaxation strength and maximum dielectric loss frequency as a function of temperature. Non-Arrhenius behavior is seen for the correlation times of the P2CH orientational autocorrelation function (OACF), the molecular dipole moment OACF, and the torsional autocorrelation function (ACF). Very close correspondence between the torsional ACF and the molecular dipole moment OACF indicates that dielectric relaxation in POE melts is due almost exclusively to local conformational motions.},

 abstract = {A rovibrational collisional model is developed to study energy transfer and dissociation of N(2)((1)Σ(g)(+)) molecules interacting with N((4)S(u)) atoms in an ideal isochoric and isothermal chemical reactor. The system examined is a mixture of molecular nitrogen and a small amount of atomic nitrogen. This mixture, initially at room temperature, is heated by several thousands of degrees Kelvin, driving the system toward a strong non-equilibrium condition. The evolution of the population densities of each individual rovibrational level is explicitly determined via the numerical solution of the master equation for temperatures ranging from 5000 to 50,000 K. The reaction rate coefficients are taken from an ab initio database developed at NASA Ames Research Center. The macroscopic relaxation times, energy transfer rates, and dissociation rate coefficients are extracted from the solution of the master equation. The computed rotational-translational (RT) and vibrational-translational (VT) relaxation times are different at low heat bath temperatures (e.g., RT is about two orders of magnitude faster than VT at T = 5000 K), but they converge to a common limiting value at high temperature. This is contrary to the conventional interpretation of thermal relaxation in which translational and rotational relaxation timescales are assumed comparable with vibrational relaxation being considerable slower. Thus, this assumption is questionable under high temperature non-equilibrium conditions. The exchange reaction plays a very significant role in determining the dynamics of the population densities. The macroscopic energy transfer and dissociation rates are found to be slower when exchange processes are neglected. A macroscopic dissociation rate coefficient based on the quasi-stationary distribution, exhibits excellent agreement with experimental data of Appleton et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 48, 599-608 (1968)]. However, at higher temperatures, only about 50% of dissociation is found to take place under quasi-stationary state conditions. This suggest the necessity of explicitly including some rovibrational levels, when solving a global kinetic rate equation.},

Insight into the importance of relativistic effects is obtained by performing all-electron non-relativistic calculations with an extended Slater basis set as well as relativistic-core potential calculations with ten electrons treated explicitly in an extended valence Gaussian basis set. Relativistic effects are observed not only to change the spatial extent of the orbitals, but also to alter substantially the configurational character of the wavefunctions. Core-valence correlation is explicitly included within a configuration-interaction treatment. Since there is a synergistic effect between correlations and relativistic effects, both must be included for consistently reliable results.

The algorithm is used to predict the tube helicities and defect configurations for bend junctions using the observed tube diameters and bend angles. The number and arrangement of the defects at the junction interfaces are found to depend on the tube helicities and bend angle. The structural and energetic calculations using the Brenner potential show a number of stable junction configurations for each bend angle with the 34° bends being more stable than the others.

 abstract = {A rovibrational collisional model is developed to study the internal energy excitation and dissociation processes behind a strong shock wave in a nitrogen flow. The reaction rate coefficients are obtained from the ab initio database of the NASA Ames Research Center. The master equation is coupled with a one-dimensional flow solver to study the nonequilibrium phenomena encountered in the gas during a hyperbolic reentry into Earth's atmosphere. The analysis of the populations of the rovibrational levels demonstrates how rotational and vibrational relaxation proceed at the same rate. This contrasts with the common misconception that translational and rotational relaxation occur concurrently. A significant part of the relaxation process occurs in non-quasi-steady-state conditions. Exchange processes are found to have a significant impact on the relaxation of the gas, while predissociation has a negligible effect. The results obtained by means of the full rovibrational collisional model are used to assess the validity of reduced order models (vibrational collisional and multitemperature) which are based on the same kinetic database. It is found that thermalization and dissociation are drastically overestimated by the reduced order models. The reasons of the failure differ in the two cases. In the vibrational collisional model the overestimation of the dissociation is a consequence of the assumption of equilibrium between the rotational energy and the translational energy. The multitemperature model fails to predict the correct thermochemical relaxation due to the failure of the quasi-steady-state assumption, used to derive the phenomenological rate coefficient for dissociation. },

IR spectroscopy in combination with results from quantum chemistry calculations shows that the initial hydrido-silsesquioxane films (cured to 250 °C) exhibit more symmetric ring structures than those for methyl-silsesquioxanes. Moreover, IR spectra indicate that increasing the cure temperature above a critical value, which varies with the Si-R moiety, causes extensive three-dimensional cross-linking in silsesquioxanes via breakage of the Si-R bond and formation of networks of O-Si-O structures with a lower ring symmetry than the initial materials. Dielectric properties do not appear to vary with the structural symmetry about the O-Si-O moiety nor with the R substituents, but rather depend on the extent of three-dimensional cross-linking as seen by the loss of Si-R absorbance. Highly cross-linked silsesquioxanes show a higher dielectric value and no variation with temperature from −100 °C to 150°C range, whereas a lower value and a negative temperature dependence are seen for dielectric constants of silsesquioxane samples with little loss of Si-R absorbance. },

A review of available thermodynamic data for species found in mixtures of carbon–phenolic pyrolysis and ablation gases and atmospheres rich with C, H, O, and N such as those of Earth, Mars, Titan, and Venus, is performed. Over 1200 unique chemical species are identified from four widely used thermodynamic databases and a systematic procedure is described for combining these data into a comprehensive model. The detailed dataset is then compared with the Chemical Equilibrium with Applications thermodynamic database developed by NASA in order to quantify the differences in equilibrium thermodynamic properties obtained with the two databases. In addition, a consistent reduction methodology using the mixture thermodynamic properties as an objective function is developed to generate reduced species sets for a variety of temperature, pressure, and elemental composition spaces. It is found that 32 and 23 species are required to model carbon–phenolic pyrolysis gases mixed with air and CO2, respectively, to maintain a maximum error in thermodynamic quantities below 10%.},

 abstract = {This work aims to construct a reduced order model for energy transfer and dissociation in non-equilibrium nitrogen mixtures. The objective is twofold: to present the Coarse-Grain Quasi-Classical Trajectory (CG-QCT) method, a novel framework for constructing a reduced order model for diatom-diatom systems; and to analyze the physics of non-equilibrium relaxation of the nitrogen molecules undergoing dissociation in an ideal chemical reactor. The CG-QCT method couples the construction of the reduced order model under the coarse-grain model framework with the quasi-classical trajectory calculations to directly construct the reduced model without the need for computing the individual rovibrational specific kinetic data. In the coarse-grain model, the energy states are lumped together into groups containing states with similar properties, and the distribution of states within each of these groups is prescribed by a Boltzmann distribution at the local translational temperature. The required grouped kinetic properties are obtained directly by the QCT calculations. Two grouping strategies are considered: energy-based grouping, in which states of similar internal energy are lumped together, and vibrational grouping, in which states with the same vibrational quantum number are grouped together. A zero-dimensional chemical reactor simulation, in which the molecules are instantaneously heated, forcing the system into strong non-equilibrium, is used to study the differences between the two grouping strategies. The comparison of the numerical results against available experimental data demonstrates that the energy-based grouping is more suitable to capture dissociation, while the energy transfer process is better described with a vibrational grouping scheme. The dissociation process is found to be strongly dependent on the behavior of the high energy states, which contribute up to 50% of the dissociating molecules. Furthermore, up to 40% of the energy required to dissociate the molecules comes from the rotational mode, underscoring the importance of accounting for this mode when constructing non-equilibrium kinetic models. In contrast, the relaxation process is governed primarily by low energy states, which exhibit significantly slower transitions in the vibrational binning model due to the prevalence of mode separation in these states.},

Quasi-stationary state (QSS) rate coefficients using both PESs have been computed at these temperatures using the Direct Molecular Simulation of Schwartzentruber and coworkers. The QSS rate coefficients are up to a factor of 5 lower than the thermal ones and the thermal and QSS values bracket the results of shock-tube experiments.

 abstract = {In this paper, we present a method to generate state-resolved reaction cross
sections in analytical form for rovibrational energy excitation and
dissociation of a molecular gas. The method is applied to an ab initio database
for the N2-N system devel- oped at NASA Ames Research Center. The detailed
information on N2 +N collisions contained in this database has been reduced by
adapting a Uniform RoVibrational- Collisional bin model originally developed
for rate coefficients. Using a 10-bin system as an example, a comparison is
made between two sets of coarse-grain cross sections, obtained by analytical
inversion and direct binning respectively. The analytical in- version approach
is especially powerful, because it manages to compress the entire set of
rovibrational-level-specific data from the Ames database into a much smaller
set of numerical parameters, sufficient to reconstruct all coarse-grain cross
sections for any particular N2 +N-collision pair. As a result of this approach,
the computational cost in in large-scale Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)
flow simulations is sig- nificantly reduced, both in terms of memory
requirements and execution time. The intended application is the simulation of
high-temperature gas-dynamics phenomena in shock-heated flows via the DSMC
method. Such conditions are typically encoun- tered in high-altitude,
high-speed atmospheric entry, or in shock-tube experiments. Using this
coarse-grain model together with ab initio rate data will enable more accu-
rate modeling nonequilibrium phenomena, such as vibrationally-favored
dissociation, an effect that is not well-captured by the conventional models
prevalent in DSMC (i.e. Larsen-Borgnakke and Total Collision Energy).},

 abstract = {This work presents a general framework for model reduction of non-equilibrium energy transfer and dissociation processes. The multi-group maximum-entropy method is coupled with the quasi-classical trajectory method to directly construct a reduced order model for chemical non-equilibrium. Kinetic data is calculated by applying detailed balance at a microscopic level, overcoming the limitation of calculating recombination kinetic data. This approach enables the construction of a reduced order model for kinetics which bypasses the need to compute state-to-state kinetic data. This physics based reduced order model ensures that an equilibrium distribution is reached given infinite time, while allowing for non-equilibrium distributions during the relaxation and dissociation processes. A proof-of-concept test case demonstrates the applicability of this model by comparison with state-to-state kinetic data for the N2(X1Σg+)−N(4Su) system with excellent agreement.},

@article{pub.1127942175,
 abstract = {This work introduces a novel methodology for the quantification of uncertainties associated with potential energy surfaces (PESs) computed from first-principles quantum mechanical calculations. The methodology relies on Bayesian inference and machine learning techniques to construct a stochastic PES and to express the inadequacies associated with the ab initio data points and their fit. By combining high fidelity calculations and reduced-order modeling, the resulting stochastic surface is efficiently forward propagated via quasi-classical trajectory and master equation calculations. In this way, the PES contribution to the uncertainty on predefined quantities of interest (QoIs) is explicitly determined. This study is done at both microscopic (e.g., rovibrational-specific rate coefficients) and macroscopic (e.g., thermal and chemical relaxation properties) levels. A correlation analysis is finally applied to identify the PES regions that require further refinement, based on their effects on the QoI reliability. The methodology is applied to the study of singlet (1<sup>1</sup>A') and quintet (2<sup>5</sup>A') PESs describing the interaction between O<sub>2</sub> molecules and O atoms in their ground electronic state. The investigation of the singlet surface reveals a negligible uncertainty on the kinetic properties and relaxation times, which are found to be in excellent agreement with the ones previously published in the literature. On the other hand, the methodology demonstrated significant uncertainty on the quintet surface, due to inaccuracies in the description of the exchange barrier and the repulsive wall. When forward propagated, this uncertainty is responsible for the variability of 1 order of magnitude in the vibrational relaxation time and of factor four in the exchange reaction rate coefficient, both at 2500 K.},

@article{pub.1132540312,
 abstract = {There has been a growing interest in implementing state-resolved models for flowfield calculations of high-speed reentry applications that are characterized by regions of strong nonequilibrium. To this end, the present work provides a technique to rigorously compute transport collision integrals for vibrationally excited molecules. Collision dynamics calculations are extended to include state-to-state (StS) effects, and vibrationally resolved transport collisional quantities including scattering angles, cross sections, and collision integrals are computed for the O+O2 system using potential energy surfaces (PESs) by Varga et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 147, 154312 (2017)JCPSA60021-960610.1063/1.4997169]. From the nine surfaces provided by Varga et al., the “surface-averaged” collision integrals are computed for the oxygen system, and Gupta-Yos-style fits to the data are provided. It is found that the StS collision integrals depend not only on the vibrational state of the molecule, but also on the spin and spatial degeneracy associated with the PES that governs the interaction. Comparison of the collision integrals from the Varga et al. surfaces with those generated from the Varandas and Pais PES [Mol. Phys. 65, 843 (1988)MOPHAM0026-897610.1080/00268978800101451] shows significant differences at highly excited vibrational states. The highly attractive nature of the Varandas and Pais surface leads to a monotonic increase in the collision integral values with vibrational excitation of O2, while the surface-averaged state-based collision integral values computed from the comparatively repulsive Varga et al. set of surfaces generally increase with vibrational excitation for temperatures up to 6000 K, and decrease with vibrational excitation at higher temperatures. Additionally, due to this nontrivial dependence of the collision integrals on the vibrational state of O2, simple empirical models are found to be unable to correctly estimate vibrational state-based collision integrals. Differences as high as 80% are obtained between the model predictions and values computed directly from the underlying PES. Evaluation of vibrationally resolved viscosity and translational thermal conductivity for the O+O2 system under equilibrium conditions indicate that both these transport coefficients depend on the vibrational excitation of O2, with the contribution of the excited vibrational states increasing with rising temperature.},

This paper presents the construction of the ground state singlet HCN potential energy surface (PES), $^1A'$ and state-to-state (StS) kinetics of the molecule-atom systems associated with HCN. The ground state HCN surface is associated to the ground state of CN ($^2\Sigma^+$) and NH ($^3\Sigma^-$) and the first excited state of CH ($^4\Sigma^-$). Multi-reference configuration interaction calculations are used to compute the ab-initio points on a grid of geometries for the diatomic potentials and the full PES. A total of 11688 ab-initio points are used to construct the potential energy surface.The diatomic potentials are fit to the Modified Morse functional form and the potential energy surface fit is obtained using a permutationally invariant polynomial neural network (PIP-NN). The RMS error in the potential energy surface fit are is upto 0.2 eV in the 0-25 eV energy range. The PES constructed highlights some important topological features. Firstly, the exchange of CH and NH to CN is barrier-less and second, the potential energy surface is characterized by two deep wells corresponding to HCN and HNC molecules in their ground singlet states. The considerably larger depth of the CN molecule diatomic potential and the barrier-less exchange pathway make exchange reactions and exchange assisted dissociation important kinetic features of the system. The potential energy surface constructed is used to carry out quasi-classical trajectory calculations followed by state-to-state isothermal heat bath simulations to study macroscopic quantities of interest to atmospheric entry. Furthermore, the exchange associated dissociation in CH and NH causes the dissociation to happen an order of magnitude faster in time when compared to only direct dissociation with the contribution due to exchange being $84.7\%$ and $82.5\%$ in the dissociation source terms, respectively.},
