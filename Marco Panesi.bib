 abstract = {This work addresses the modeling of non-equilibrium phenomena in inductively coupled plasma discharges. In the proposed computational model, the electromagnetic induction equation is solved together with the set of Navier-Stokes equations in order to compute the electromagnetic and flow fields, accounting for their mutual interaction. Semi-classical statistical thermodynamics is used to determine the plasma thermodynamic properties, while transport properties are obtained from kinetic principles, with the method of Chapman and Enskog. Particle ambipolar diffusive fluxes are found by solving the Stefan-Maxwell equations with a simple iterative method. Two physico-mathematical formulations are used to model the chemical reaction processes: (1) A Local Thermodynamics Equilibrium (LTE) formulation and (2) a thermo-chemical non-equilibrium (TCNEQ) formulation. In the TCNEQ model, thermal non-equilibrium between the translational energy mode of the gas and the vibrational energy mode of individual molecules is accounted for. The electronic states of the chemical species are assumed in equilibrium with the vibrational temperature, whereas the rotational energy mode is assumed to be equilibrated with translation. Three different physical models are used to account for the coupling of chemistry and energy transfer processes. Numerical simulations obtained with the LTE and TCNEQ formulations are used to characterize the extent of non-equilibrium of the flow inside the Plasmatron facility at the von Karman Institute. Each model was tested using different kinetic mechanisms to assess the sensitivity of the results to variations in the reaction parameters. A comparison of temperatures and composition profiles at the outlet of the torch demonstrates that the flow is in non-equilibrium for operating conditions characterized by pressures below 30 000 Pa, frequency 0.37 MHz, input power 80 kW, and mass flow 8 g/s.},

 abstract = {5 ConclusionsA numerical model for all speed ICP flows has been presented and applied to the VKI pilot ICP facility equipped with a converging-diverging nozzle producing a Mach 2.5 plasma jet. The main features of the model are the following:
thermodynamic properties computed using a statistical mechanics formulation,transport properties evaluated from a perturbative Chapman-Enskog analyis, and computed using modern linear algebra algorithms,multiblock cell-centered finite volume formulation, with preconditioned AUSM+ flux formula for the convective terms in the Navier-Stokes equations,implicit time stepping/damped quasi-Newton iterative solution strategy with loose coupling of the electromagnetic and flow problems.The numerical simulations demonstrate the ability of the solver to handle plasma flows with a combination of (extended) low speed regions and supersonic regions. It now remains to validate these encouraging preliminary results against other numerical simulations and experiments.},

 abstract = {The objective in this paper is to analyze some stochastic models for estimating the ionization reaction rate constant of atomic Nitrogen (N+e−→N++2e−). Parameters of the models are identified by means of Bayesian inference using spatially resolved absolute radiance data obtained from the Electric Arc Shock Tube (EAST) wind-tunnel. The proposed methodology accounts for uncertainties in the model parameters as well as physical model inadequacies, providing estimates of the rate constant that reflect both types of uncertainties. We present four different probabilistic models by varying the error structure (either additive or multiplicative) and by choosing different descriptions of the statistical correlation among data points. In order to assess the validity of our methodology, we first present some calibration results obtained with manufactured data and then proceed by using experimental data collected at EAST experimental facility. In order to simulate the radiative signature emitted in the shock-heated air plasma, we use a one-dimensional flow solver with Park’s two-temperature model that simulates non-equilibrium effects. We also discuss the implications of the choice of the stochastic model on the estimation of the reaction rate and its uncertainties. Our analysis shows that the stochastic models based on correlated multiplicative errors are the most plausible models among the four models proposed in this study. The rate of the atomic Nitrogen ionization is found to be (6.2±3.3)×1011cm3mol−1s−1 at 10,000K.},

 abstract = {The relaxation of N₂(X¹Σg⁺) molecules in a background gas composed of N((4)S(u)) atoms and free electrons is studied by using an ideal isochoric and isothermic chemical reactor. A rovibrational state-to-state model is developed to study energy transfer process induced by free electron and atomic collisions. The required cross sections and the corresponding rate coefficients are taken from two well-known kinetic databases: NASA Ames kinetic mechanism for the description of the N₂(X¹Σg⁺)-N((4)S(u)) processes and the Phys4Entry database for the electron driven processes, N₂(X¹Σg⁺)-e(-). The evolution of the population densities of each individual rovibrational level is explicitly determined via the numerical solution of the master equation for temperatures ranging from 10000 to 30,000 K. It was found that the distribution of the rovibrational energy levels of N₂(X¹Σg⁺) is strongly influenced by the electron driven collisional processes, which promote the excitation of the low lying vibrational levels. The macroscopic vibrational energy relaxation is governed by the molecule-atom collisions, when free electrons, initially cold are relaxing to the final heat-bath temperature. Thus, the main role of the free electrons is to ensure the equilibration of vibrational and free electron excitation, thus validating the existence of the local equilibrium T(V)-T(e). However, if electrons and heavy particles are assumed to be in equilibrium at the heat bath temperature, electron driven processes dominate the vibrational relaxation. Finally, we have assessed the validity of the Landau-Teller model for the description of the inelastic energy transfer between molecules and free electrons. In the case of free-electron temperatures lower than 10,000 K, Landau-Teller relaxation model gives an accurate description of the vibrational relaxation, while at higher temperatures the error in the predictions can be significant and the model should not be used.},

 abstract = {A rovibrational collisional coarse-grain model has been developed to reduce a detailed mechanism for the internal energy excitation and dissociation processes behind a strong shockwave in a nitrogen flow. The rovibrational energy levels of the electronic ground state of the nitrogen molecule were lumped into a smaller number of bins. The reaction rate coefficients of an ab initio database developed at NASA Ames Research Center were averaged for each bin based on a uniform distribution of the energy levels within the bin. The results were obtained by coupling the Master equation for the reduced mechanism with a one-dimensional flow solver for conditions expected for reentry into Earth’s atmosphere at 10km/s. The coarse-grain collisional model developed allow us to describe accurately the internal energy relaxation and dissociation processes based on a smaller number of equations, as opposed to existing reduced models assuming thermal equilibrium between the rotational and translational energy modes.},

These processes usually employ mathematical models that have to be properly calibrated and rigorously validated so that their reliability can be clearly assessed. A validation procedure based on a Bayesian approach is applied here to a data reduction model used in shock tube experiments. In these experiments, the raw data, given in terms of photon counts received by an ICCD camera, are post-processed into radiative intensities. Simple mathematical models describing the nonlinear behavior associated with very short opening times (gate widths) of the camera are developed, calibrated, and not invalidated, or invalidated, in this study. The main objective here is to determine the feasibility of the methodology to precisely quantify the uncertainties emanating from the raw data and from the choice of the reduction model. In this analysis of the methodology, shortcomings, suggested improvements, and future research areas are also highlighted.

The rate coefficients for rovibrational dissociation and excitation are provided by two chemical databases for the N + N2 system recently developed at NASA Ames Research Center and the University of Bari. Vibrationally averaged rate coefficients for N + N2 collisions are computed based on the hypothesis of equilibrium between translational and rotational modes. N2 + N2 collisions are also considered based on literature data. Inviscid and quasi 1D governing equations are discretized in space by means of a finite volume method. A fully implicit time integration method is applied to obtain steady state solutions. Results show that, for both N + N2 and N2 + N2 collision dominated flows, the populations of vibrational levels deviate from a Boltzmann distribution. An accurate investigation of vibrational level dynamics shows the different behavior of low and high-lying states.

 abstract = {A review is made of the computational models of high-enthalpy flows developed over the past few years at the von Karman Institute and Université Libre de Bruxelles, for the modelling of high-enthalpy hypersonic (re-)entry flows. Both flows in local thermo-chemical equilibrium (LTE) and flows in thermo-chemical non-equilibrium (TCNEQ) are considered. First, the physico-chemical models are described, i.e. the set of conservation laws, the thermodynamics, transport phenomena and chemical kinetics models. Particular attention is given to the correct modelling of elemental (LTE flows) and species (chemical non-equilibrium—CNEQ—flows) transport. The numerical algorithm, based on a state-of-the-art finite volume discretization, is then briefly described. Finally, selected examples are included to illustrate the capabilities of the developed solver.},

 abstract = {This work addresses the modeling of dissociation and energy transfer processes in shock heated nitrogen flows by means of the maximum entropy linear model and a newly proposed hybrid bin vibrational collisional model. Both models aim at overcoming two of the main limitations of the state of the art non-equilibrium models: (i) the assumption of equilibrium between rotational and translational energy modes of the molecules and (ii) the reliance on the quasi-steady-state distribution for the description of the population of the internal levels. The formulation of the coarse-grained models is based on grouping the energy levels into bins, where the population is assumed to follow a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at its own temperature. Different grouping strategies are investigated. Following the maximum entropy principle, the governing equations are obtained by taking the zeroth and first-order moments of the rovibrational master equations. The accuracy of the proposed models is tested against the rovibrational master equation solution for both flow quantities and population distributions. Calculations performed for free-stream velocities ranging from 5 km/s to 10 km/s demonstrate that dissociation can be accurately predicted by using only 2-3 bins. It is also shown that a multi-temperature approach leads to an under-prediction of dissociation, due to the inability of the former to account for the faster excitation of high-lying vibrational states.},

 abstract = {The validation process proposed by Babuška et al. [1] is applied to thermochemical models describing post-shock flow conditions. In this validation approach, experimental data is involved only in the calibration of the models, and the decision process is based on quantities of interest (QoIs) predicted on scenarios that are not necessarily amenable experimentally. Moreover, uncertainties present in the experimental data, as well as those resulting from an incomplete physical model description, are propagated to the QoIs. We investigate four commonly used thermochemical models: a one-temperature model (which assumes thermal equilibrium among all inner modes), and two-temperature models developed by Macheret et al. [2], Marrone and Treanor [3], and Park [4]. Up to 16 uncertain parameters are estimated using Bayesian updating based on the latest absolute volumetric radiance data collected at the Electric Arc Shock Tube (EAST) installed inside the NASA Ames Research Center. Following the solution of the inverse problems, the forward problems are solved in order to predict the radiative heat flux, QoI, and examine the validity of these models. Our results show that all four models are invalid, but for different reasons: the one-temperature model simply fails to reproduce the data while the two-temperature models exhibit unacceptably large uncertainties in the QoI predictions.},

 abstract = {This paper opens a new door to macroscopic modeling for thermal and chemical non-equilibrium. In a game-changing approach, we discard conventional theories and practices stemming from the separation of internal energy modes and the Landau-Teller relaxation equation. Instead, we solve the fundamental microscopic equations in their moment forms but seek only optimum representations for the microscopic state distribution function that provides converged and time accurate solutions for certain macroscopic quantities at all times. The modeling makes no ad hoc assumptions or simplifications at the microscopic level and includes all possible collisional and radiative processes; it therefore retains all non-equilibrium fluid physics. We formulate the thermal and chemical non-equilibrium macroscopic equations and rate coefficients in a coupled and unified fashion for gases undergoing completely general transitions. All collisional partners can have internal structures and can change their internal energy states after transitions. The model is based on the reconstruction of the state distribution function. The internal energy space is subdivided into multiple groups in order to better describe non-equilibrium state distributions. The logarithm of the distribution function in each group is expressed as a power series in internal energy based on the maximum entropy principle. The method of weighted residuals is applied to the microscopic equations to obtain macroscopic moment equations and rate coefficients succinctly to any order. The model's accuracy depends only on the assumed expression of the state distribution function and the number of groups used and can be self-checked for accuracy and convergence. We show that the macroscopic internal energy transfer, similar to mass and momentum transfers, occurs through nonlinear collisional processes and is not a simple relaxation process described by, e.g., the Landau-Teller equation. Unlike the classical vibrational energy relaxation model, which can only be applied to molecules, the new model is applicable to atoms, molecules, ions, and their mixtures. Numerical examples and model validations are carried out with two gas mixtures using the maximum entropy linear model: one mixture consists of nitrogen molecules undergoing internal excitation and dissociation and the other consists of nitrogen atoms undergoing internal excitation and ionization. Results show that the original hundreds to thousands of microscopic equations can be reduced to two macroscopic equations with almost perfect agreement for the total number density and total internal energy using only one or two groups. We also obtain good prediction of the microscopic state populations using 5-10 groups in the macroscopic equations. },

 abstract = {The goal of this study is to gain some physical insights and an understanding of the computational challenges for the simulations related to the hypersonic nonequilibrium multi-species and multi-reaction experiments on the NASA Electric Arc Shock Tube (EAST). While experimental measurement does not provide any information about the radial structure of this type of flow, accurate and reliable numerical simulations can provide more insight into the physical structure of the flow to aid the design of atmospheric entry spacecrafts. The paper focuses on the spurious numerics which take place in numerical simulations of the subject physics containing stiff source terms and discontinuities. This paper is based on the knowledge gained from Yee et al. on simple reacting test cases (Yee et al. 2013, [9]) as a guide to reveal the computational challenges involved for such an extreme flow type. The results of the 1D and 2D EAST viscous and inviscid simulations using a simplified physical model are presented. The computation reveals, for the first time, that the 2D viscous model which contains both shocks and shears exhibits Tollmien–Schlichting-like instability complex patterns at the boundary layer. In addition to exhibiting spurious numerical behavior of wrong propagation speed of discontinuities by typical shock-capturing methods, there is improved understanding on the cause of numerical difficulties by previous investigators. One example is that the relative distance between the shocks and shear/contact is different from one grid spacing to another for each considered high order shock-capturing scheme. The results presented can provide insight on the numerical instability observed by previous investigations and future algorithm development for this type of extreme flow.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we apply a Bayesian analysis to calibrate the parameters of a model for atomic nitrogen ionization using experimental data from the electric arc shock tube (EAST) wind-tunnel at NASA. We use a one-dimensional plasma flow solver coupled with a radiation solver for the simulation of the radiative signature emitted in the shock-heated air plasma as well as a Park’s two-temperature model for the thermal and chemical non-equilibrium effects. We simultaneously quantify model parameter uncertainties and physical model inadequacies when solving the statistical inverse problem. Prior to the solution of such a problem, we perform a sensitivity analysis of the radiative heat flux in order to identify important sources of uncertainty. This analysis clearly shows the importance of the direct ionization of atomic nitrogen as it mostly influences the radiative heating. We then solve the statistical inverse problem and compare the calibrated reaction rates against values available in the literature. Our calculations estimate the reaction rate of the atomic nitrogen ionization to be (3.7 ± 1.5) × 1011 cm3 mol−1 s−1 at 10 000 K, a range consistent with Park’s estimation. Finally, in order to assess the validity of the estimated parameters, we propagate their uncertainties through a statistical forward problem defined on a prediction scenario different from the calibration scenarios and compare the model predictions against other experimental data.},

 abstract = {A rovibrational collisional model is developed to study energy transfer and dissociation of N(2)((1)Σ(g)(+)) molecules interacting with N((4)S(u)) atoms in an ideal isochoric and isothermal chemical reactor. The system examined is a mixture of molecular nitrogen and a small amount of atomic nitrogen. This mixture, initially at room temperature, is heated by several thousands of degrees Kelvin, driving the system toward a strong non-equilibrium condition. The evolution of the population densities of each individual rovibrational level is explicitly determined via the numerical solution of the master equation for temperatures ranging from 5000 to 50,000 K. The reaction rate coefficients are taken from an ab initio database developed at NASA Ames Research Center. The macroscopic relaxation times, energy transfer rates, and dissociation rate coefficients are extracted from the solution of the master equation. The computed rotational-translational (RT) and vibrational-translational (VT) relaxation times are different at low heat bath temperatures (e.g., RT is about two orders of magnitude faster than VT at T = 5000 K), but they converge to a common limiting value at high temperature. This is contrary to the conventional interpretation of thermal relaxation in which translational and rotational relaxation timescales are assumed comparable with vibrational relaxation being considerable slower. Thus, this assumption is questionable under high temperature non-equilibrium conditions. The exchange reaction plays a very significant role in determining the dynamics of the population densities. The macroscopic energy transfer and dissociation rates are found to be slower when exchange processes are neglected. A macroscopic dissociation rate coefficient based on the quasi-stationary distribution, exhibits excellent agreement with experimental data of Appleton et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 48, 599-608 (1968)]. However, at higher temperatures, only about 50% of dissociation is found to take place under quasi-stationary state conditions. This suggest the necessity of explicitly including some rovibrational levels, when solving a global kinetic rate equation.},

 abstract = {We present a reduced kinetic mechanism for the modeling of the behavior of the electronic states of the atomic species in air mixtures. The model is built by lumping the electronically excited states of the atomic species and by performing Maxwell-Boltzmann averages of the rate constants describing the elementary kinetic processes of the individual states within each group. The necessary reaction rate coefficients are taken from the model compiled by Bultel et al. [“Collisional-radiative model in air for earth re-entry problems,” Phys. Plasmas 13, 043502 (2006)10.1063/1.2194827]. The reduced number of pseudo-states considered leads to a significant reduction of the computational cost, thus enabling the application of the state of the art collisional radiative models to bi-dimensional and three-dimensional problems. The internal states of the molecular species are assumed to be in equilibrium. The rotational energy mode is assumed to quickly equilibrate with the translational energy mode at the kinetic temperature of the heavy species as opposed to the electronic and the vibrational modes, assumed to be in Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium at a common temperature TV. In a first step we validate the model by using simple zero- and one-dimensional test cases for which the full kinetic mechanism can be run efficiently. Finally, the reduced kinetic model is used to analyze the strong non-equilibrium flow surrounding the FIRE II flight experiment during the early part of its re-entry trajectory. It is found that the reduced kinetic mechanism is capable of reproducing the ionizational non-equilibrium phenomena, responsible for the drastic reduction of the radiative heat loads on the space capsules during the re-entry phase.},

In the present analysis, the electronic excited states of atomic and molecular species are treated as separate pseudo-species. Rotational and vibrational energy modes are assumed to be populated according to Boltzmann distributions. The coupling between radiation and gas dynamics is accounted for, in simplified manner, by using escape factors. The flow governing equations for the steady quasi-one-dimensional flow are written in conservative form and discretized in space by means of a finite volume method. Steady-state solutions are obtained by using a fully implicit time integration scheme. The analysis of the evolution of the electronic distribution functions reveals a substantial over-population of the high-lying excited levels of atoms and molecules in correspondence of the nozzle exit. The influence of optical thickness is also studied.

We find that the preferential Ni-C bonding over C-C bonding induces a repulsive interaction between C atoms located at diagonal octahedral voids in Ni substrates. This C-C interaction accelerates C atom diffusion in Ni with a reduced barrier energy of ∼1 eV, compared to ∼1.4-1.6 eV for the diffusion of isolated C atoms. The diffusion barrier energy of isolated C atoms in Cu is lower than in Ni. However, bulk diffusion of interacting C atoms in Cu is not possible due to the preferential C-C bonding over C-Cu bonding, which results in C-C dimer pair formation near the surface. The dramatically different C-C interaction effects within the different substrates explain the contrasting growth mechanisms of graphene on Ni(111) and Cu(111) during chemical vapor deposition. },

 abstract = {The objective of the present work is the development of a tightly coupled magneto-hydrodynamic model for inductively coupled radio-frequency plasmas. Non Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) effects are described based on a hybrid State-to-State approach. A multi-temperature formulation is used to account for thermal non-equilibrium between translation of heavy-particles and vibration of molecules. Excited electronic states of atoms are instead treated as separate pseudo-species, allowing for non-Boltzmann distributions of their populations. Free-electrons are assumed Maxwellian at their own temperature. The governing equations for the electro-magnetic field and the gas properties (e.g., chemical composition and temperatures) are written as a coupled system of time-dependent conservation laws. Steady-state solutions are obtained by means of an implicit Finite Volume method. The results obtained in both LTE and NLTE conditions over a broad spectrum of operating conditions demonstrate the robustness of the proposed coupled numerical method. The analysis of chemical composition and temperature distributions along the torch radius shows that: (i) the use of the LTE assumption may lead to an inaccurate prediction of the thermo-chemical state of the gas, and (ii) non-equilibrium phenomena play a significant role close the walls, due to the combined effects of Ohmic heating and macroscopic gradients.},

 abstract = {Scalable and precise nanopatterning of graphene is an essential step for graphene-based device fabrication. Hydrogen-plasma reactions have been shown to narrow graphene only from the edges, or to selectively produce circular or hexagonal holes in the basal plane of graphene, but the underlying plasma-graphene chemistry is unknown. Here, we study the hydrogen-plasma etching of monolayer graphene supported on SiO2 substrates across the range of plasma ion energies using scale-bridging molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on reactive force-field potential. Our results uncover distinct etching mechanisms, operative within narrow ion energy windows, which fully explain the differing plasma-graphene reactions observed experimentally. Specific ion energy ranges are demonstrated for stable isotropic (∼2eV) versus anisotropic hole growth (∼20–30eV) within the basal plane of graphene, as well as for pure edge etching of graphene (∼1eV). Understanding the complex plasma-graphene chemistry opens up a means for controlled patterning of graphene nanostructures.},

 abstract = {A Boltzmann rovibrational collisional coarse-grained model is proposed to reduce a detailed kinetic mechanism database developed at NASA Ames Research Center for internal energy transfer and dissociation in N(2)-N interactions. The coarse-grained model is constructed by lumping the rovibrational energy levels of the N(2) molecule into energy bins. The population of the levels within each bin is assumed to follow a Boltzmann distribution at the local translational temperature. Excitation and dissociation rate coefficients for the energy bins are obtained by averaging the elementary rate coefficients. The energy bins are treated as separate species, thus allowing for non-Boltzmann distributions of their populations. The proposed coarse-grained model is applied to the study of nonequilibrium flows behind normal shock waves and within converging-diverging nozzles. In both cases, the flow is assumed inviscid and steady. Computational results are compared with those obtained by direct solution of the master equation for the rovibrational collisional model and a more conventional multitemperature model. It is found that the proposed coarse-grained model is able to accurately resolve the nonequilibrium dynamics of internal energy excitation and dissociation-recombination processes with only 20 energy bins. Furthermore, the proposed coarse-grained model provides a superior description of the nonequilibrium phenomena occurring in shock heated and nozzle flows when compared with the conventional multitemperature models.},

 abstract = {A rovibrational collisional model is developed to study the internal energy excitation and dissociation processes behind a strong shock wave in a nitrogen flow. The reaction rate coefficients are obtained from the ab initio database of the NASA Ames Research Center. The master equation is coupled with a one-dimensional flow solver to study the nonequilibrium phenomena encountered in the gas during a hyperbolic reentry into Earth's atmosphere. The analysis of the populations of the rovibrational levels demonstrates how rotational and vibrational relaxation proceed at the same rate. This contrasts with the common misconception that translational and rotational relaxation occur concurrently. A significant part of the relaxation process occurs in non-quasi-steady-state conditions. Exchange processes are found to have a significant impact on the relaxation of the gas, while predissociation has a negligible effect. The results obtained by means of the full rovibrational collisional model are used to assess the validity of reduced order models (vibrational collisional and multitemperature) which are based on the same kinetic database. It is found that thermalization and dissociation are drastically overestimated by the reduced order models. The reasons of the failure differ in the two cases. In the vibrational collisional model the overestimation of the dissociation is a consequence of the assumption of equilibrium between the rotational energy and the translational energy. The multitemperature model fails to predict the correct thermochemical relaxation due to the failure of the quasi-steady-state assumption, used to derive the phenomenological rate coefficient for dissociation. },

 abstract = {This work addresses the study of the behavior of the excited electronic states of CO molecules in the nonequilibrium relaxation zone behind a normal shock for a CO2-N2 mixture representative of the Mars atmosphere. The hybrid state-to-state (StS) model developed accounts for thermal nonequilibrium between the translational energy mode of the gas and the vibrational energy mode of individual molecules. The electronic states of CO molecules are treated as separate species, allowing for non-Boltzmann distributions of their populations. The StS model is coupled with a nonequilibrium radiation solver, hpc-rad, allowing for the calculation of the radiation signature from the molecular and atomic species in the gas. This study focuses on the radiation from the fourth positive system of CO, which dominates the radiation heating on the forebody for higher speed Mars entry applications. In the rapidly dissociating regime behind strong shock waves, the population of the ground electronic state of CO [CO(X1Σ)], departs from Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions, owing to the efficient collisional excitation to the electronically excited CO(A1Π) state. In general the assumption of the equilibrium between electronic and vibration fails when the excitation of electronic states is driven by heavy particles. The comparison of the radiation heating predictions obtained using the conventional quasi-steady-state (QSS) approach and the physics-based StS approach revealed differences in radiative heating predictions of up to 50%. These results demonstrate that the choice of nonequilibrium model can have a significant impact on radiative heating simulations, and more importantly, they cast serious doubts on the validity of the QSS assumption for the condition of interest to this work.},

 abstract = {This work addresses the modeling of high pressure electric discharge in an arc-heated wind tunnel. The combined numerical solution of Poisson's equation, radiative transfer equations, and the set of Favre-averaged thermochemical nonequilibrium Navier–Stokes equations allows for the determination of the electric, radiation, and flow fields, accounting for their mutual interaction. Semi-classical statistical thermodynamics is used to determine the plasma thermodynamic properties, while transport properties are obtained from kinetic principles with the Chapman–Enskog method. A multi-temperature formulation is used to account for thermal non-equilibrium. Finally, the turbulence closure of the flow equations is obtained by means of the Spalart–Allmaras model, which requires the solution of an additional scalar transport equation. A Streamline upwind Petrov–Galerkin stabilized finite element formulation is employed to solve the Navier–Stokes equation. The electric field equation is solved using the standard Galerkin formulation. A stable formulation for the radiative transfer equations is obtained using the least-squares finite element method. The developed simulation framework has been applied to investigate turbulent plasma flows in the 20 MW Aerodynamic Heating Facility at NASA Ames Research Center. The current model is able to predict the process of energy addition and re-distribution due to Joule heating and thermal radiation, resulting in a hot central core surrounded by colder flow. The use of an unsteady three-dimensional treatment also allows the asymmetry due to a dynamic electric arc attachment point in the cathode chamber to be captured accurately. The current work paves the way for detailed estimation of operating characteristics for arc-heated wind tunnels which are critical in testing thermal protection systems.},

 abstract = {The present work proposes a self-consistent reduced-order NLTE kinetic model for radiating plasmas found in the outer layers of stellar atmospheres. A detailed collisional-radiative kinetic mechanism is constructed by leveraging the most up-to-date set of ab initio and experimental data available in the literature. This constitutes the starting point for the derivation of a reduced-order model, obtained by lumping the bound energy states into groups. In order to determine the needed thermo-physical group properties, uniform and Maxwell–Boltzmann energy distributions are used to reconstruct the energy population of each group. Finally, the reduced set of governing equations for the material gas and the radiation field is obtained based on the moment method. Applications consider the steady flow across a shock wave in partially ionized hydrogen. The results clearly demonstrate that adopting a Maxwell–Boltzmann grouping allows, on the one hand, for a substantial reduction of the number of unknowns and, on the other, to maintain accuracy for both gas and radiation quantities. Also, it is observed that, when neglecting line radiation, the use of two groups already leads to a very accurate resolution of the photo-ionization precursor, internal relaxation, and radiative cooling regions. The inclusion of line radiation requires adopting just one additional group to account for optically thin losses in the α, β, and γ lines of the Balmer and Paschen series. This trend has been observed for a wide range of shock wave velocities.},

 abstract = {A novel reduced-order method is presented for modeling reacting flows characterized by strong non-equilibrium of the internal energy level distribution of chemical species in the gas. The approach seeks for a reduced-order representation of the distribution function by grouping individual energy states into macroscopic bins, and then reconstructing state population using the maximum entropy principle. This work introduces an adaptive grouping methodology to identify and lump together groups of states that are likely to equilibrate faster with respect to each other. To this aim, two algorithms have been considered: the modified island algorithm and the spectral clustering method. Both methods require a measure of dissimilarity between internal energy states. This is achieved by defining "metrics" based on the strength of the elementary rate coefficients included in the state-specific kinetic mechanism. Penalty terms are used to avoid grouping together states characterized by distinctively different energies. The two methods are used to investigate excitation and dissociation of N<sub>2</sub> (Σg+1) molecules due to interaction with N(Su4) atoms in an ideal chemical reactor. The results are compared with a direct numerical simulation of the state-specific kinetics obtained by solving the master equations for the complete set of energy levels. It is found that adaptive grouping techniques outperform the more conventional uniform energy grouping algorithm by providing a more accurate description of the distribution function, mole fraction and energy profiles during non-equilibrium relaxation.},

 abstract = {A hypersonic flowfield model that treats electronic levels of the dominant afterbody radiator N as individual species is presented. This model allows electron-ion recombination rate and two-temperature modeling improvements, the latter which are shown to decrease afterbody radiative heating by up to 30%. This decrease is primarily due to the addition of the electron-impact excitation energy-exchange term to the energy equation governing the vibrational-electronic electron temperature. This model also allows the validity of the often applied quasi-steady-state (QSS) approximation to be assessed. The QSS approximation is shown to fail throughout most of the afterbody region for lower electronic states, although this impacts the radiative intensity reaching the surface by less than 15%. By computing the electronic-state populations of N within the flowfield solver, instead of through the QSS approximation in the radiation solver, the coupling of nonlocal radiative transition rates to the species continuity equations becomes feasible. Implementation of this higher-fidelity level of coupling between the flowfield and radiation solvers is shown to increase the afterbody radiation by up to 50% relative to the conventional model.},

The CG-QCT method couples the construction of the reduced order model under the coarse-grain model framework with the quasi-classical trajectory calculations to directly construct the reduced model without the need for computing the individual rovibrational specific kinetic data. In the coarse-grain model, the energy states are lumped together into groups containing states with similar properties, and the distribution of states within each of these groups is prescribed by a Boltzmann distribution at the local translational temperature. The required grouped kinetic properties are obtained directly by the QCT calculations. Two grouping strategies are considered: energy-based grouping, in which states of similar internal energy are lumped together, and vibrational grouping, in which states with the same vibrational quantum number are grouped together. A zero-dimensional chemical reactor simulation, in which the molecules are instantaneously heated, forcing the system into strong non-equilibrium, is used to study the differences between the two grouping strategies. The comparison of the numerical results against available experimental data demonstrates that the energy-based grouping is more suitable to capture dissociation, while the energy transfer process is better described with a vibrational grouping scheme. The dissociation process is found to be strongly dependent on the behavior of the high energy states, which contribute up to 50% of the dissociating molecules. Furthermore, up to 40% of the energy required to dissociate the molecules comes from the rotational mode, underscoring the importance of accounting for this mode when constructing non-equilibrium kinetic models. In contrast, the relaxation process is governed primarily by low energy states, which exhibit significantly slower transitions in the vibrational binning model due to the prevalence of mode separation in these states.},

 abstract = {This work presents the analysis of non-equilibrium energy transfer and dissociation of nitrogen molecules (N<sub>2</sub>(Σg+1)) using two different approaches: the direct molecular simulation (DMS) method and the coarse-grain quasi-classical trajectory (CG-QCT) method. The two methods are used to study thermochemical relaxation in a zero-dimensional isochoric and isothermal reactor in which the nitrogen molecules are heated to several thousand degrees Kelvin, forcing the system into strong non-equilibrium. The analysis considers thermochemical relaxation for temperatures ranging from 10 000 to 25 000 K. Both methods make use of the same potential energy surface for the N<sub>2</sub>(Σg+1)-N<sub>2</sub>(Σg+1) system taken from the NASA Ames quantum chemistry database. Within the CG-QCT method, the rovibrational energy levels of the electronic ground state of the nitrogen molecule are lumped into a reduced number of bins. Two different grouping strategies are used: the more conventional vibrational-based grouping, widely used in the literature, and energy-based grouping. The analysis of both the internal state populations and concentration profiles show excellent agreement between the energy-based grouping and the DMS solutions. During the energy transfer process, discrepancies arise between the energy-based grouping and DMS solution due to the increased importance of mode separation for low energy states. By contrast, the vibrational grouping, traditionally considered state-of-the-art, captures well the behavior of the energy relaxation but fails to consistently predict the dissociation process. The deficiency of the vibrational grouping model is due to the assumption of strict mode separation and equilibrium of rotational energy states. These assumptions result in errors predicting the energy contribution to dissociation from the rotational and vibrational modes, with rotational energy actually contributing 30%-40% of the energy required to dissociate a molecule. This work confirms the findings discussed in Paper I [R. L. Macdonald et al., J. Chem. Phys. 148, 054309 (2018)], which underlines the importance of rotational energy to the dissociation process, and demonstrates that an accurate non-equilibrium chemistry model must accurately predict the deviation of rovibrational distribution from equilibrium.},

Quasi-stationary state (QSS) rate coefficients using both PESs have been computed at these temperatures using the Direct Molecular Simulation of Schwartzentruber and coworkers. The QSS rate coefficients are up to a factor of 5 lower than the thermal ones and the thermal and QSS values bracket the results of shock-tube experiments.

However, restrictions placed on the export of experimental data concerning its performance make collaborative efforts aimed at improving existing heat-shield design tools difficult to establish. The material model dubbed VISTA provides an alternative open-source platform upon which the physics of ablation can be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, calibration of a material model through Bayesian inference is demonstrated with VISTA and open-source Apollo-era AVCOAT flight data. A sensitivity analysis is first carried out using Pearson correlation coefficients and method of Sobol where the results of both approaches are compared. The calibration methodology used in this paper is then demonstrated first with the use of manufactured data. Following, the parameters of VISTA are calibrated using material temperature data recorded during the Apollo 4 test flight and uncertainties due to parametric, modeling, and data inaccuracy sources are simultaneously quantified. Uncertainty quantification of model output in this work is done by forward propagating quantified uncertainties onto model output where a large reduction in total uncertainty is observed.},

 abstract = {The present work proposes a self-consistent reduced-order NLTE kinetic model
for radiating plasmas such as are found in the outer layers of stellar
atmospheres. Starting from the most up-to-date set of ab-initio and
experimental data, the highly complex collisional-radiative kinetic mechanism
is simplified by lumping the bound energy states in groups. Different grouping
strategies are investigated, such as uniform and Maxwell-Boltzmann. The reduced
set of governing equations for the material gas and the radiation field is
obtained based on a moment method. Applications consider the steady flow across
a shock wave in partially ionized hydrogen. The results show that adopting a
Maxwell-Boltzmann grouping allows, on the one hand, for a substantial reduction
of the number of unknowns and, on the other, to maintain accuracy for both gas
and radiation quantities. It is observed that, when neglecting line radiation,
the use of two groups already leads to a very accurate resolution of the
photo-ionization precursor, internal relaxation and radiative cooling regions.
The inclusion of line radiation requires adopting just one additional group to
account for optically thin losses in the alpha, beta and gamma lines of the
Balmer and Paschen series. This trend has been observed for a wide range of
shock wave velocities.},

 abstract = {This work proposes a general framework for developing reduced-order models (including both kinetics and transport) for hypersonic flows in thermo-chemical non-equilibrium. Reduced-order modeling is achieved by lumping energy states in groups and by prescribing withing each group a local representation which maximizes the entropy under constraints of mass and energy conservation (Maximum Entropy Linear model; MEL). The governing equations for the group parameters are obtained by taking energy moments of the master equations. Applications consider the complexity reduction of the O2 molecule vibrational kinetics. The accuracy of the MEL model is assessed via comparison with State-to-State predictions in two cases: (i) isothermal chemical reactor (dissociating case) and (ii) Lagrangian nozzle flow (recombining case). In both circumstances results show an excellent agreement with the master equation solution. The MEL is then applied to simulate the steady axi-symmetric viscous flow within a nozzle. Results underline the importance of a proper characterization of non-equilibrium re-combination within nozzles in high-enthalpy wind tunnels. To the author’s best knowledge, this case marks the first attempt of integration of a self-consistent reduced-order model (i.e., MEL model) in a CFD solver for non-equilibrium flows.},

The use of the coarse grain approach, which entails grouping individual internal states together into macroscopic bins, allows a dramatic reduction in computational costs while retaining key information from the full state-to-state model. The accuracy of the current model reduction methodology is further improved by utilizing state-specific kinetics to determine an optimal strategy for dividing states into bins. The time-evolution of CO2 under strong thermal and chemical non-equilibrium in an ideal chemical reactor is studied using both the full vibrational state-to-state model and the resultant coarse grain-based reduced-order models. The developed reduced-order model successfully reproduces the internal population distribution and other macroscopic quantities of interest while providing a nearly three order of magnitude speedup. The new modeling framework is used to investigate the flowfield and radiative heating during atmo-spheric entry for the Mars 2020 mission. Predictions for the forebody region match results obtained using conventional multi-temperature models.

 abstract = {The current work presents a computationally tractable simulation methodology combining different model-reduction techniques for resolving non-Boltzmann thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, and radiative transfer in complex three-dimensional flows. The empiricism associated with conventional multitemperature nonequilibrium models is abandoned in favor of the multigroup maximum entropy method combined with kinetics-informed adaptive binning. This group-based approach allows for time-varying optimal reduced-order representation of the internal state population distribution while accounting for all collisional processes included in the state-to-state model. Similarly, radiative transfer calculations are performed efficiently by discretization in the spectral, angular, and spatial spaces using the smeared band, discrete ordinate, and finite-volume methods, respectively. This reduction in computational overhead allows truly non-Boltzmann simulations with two-way coupling between the flow and radiation fields to be realized without simplifying approximations based on the tangent-slab method or local escape-factors. The simulation procedure is used in conjunction with the US3D flow solver to investigate the impact of vibrational nonequilibrium on CO2 wake flows and resultant infrared radiation around the Mars 2020 vehicle. This involves comparing predictions for flow-field properties and radiative transfer obtained using the conventional two-temperature model, the multigroup non-Boltzmann model, and for decoupled/coupled flow-radiation calculations. Conventional two-temperature models overestimate the rate of thermal equilibration in the near-wake region resulting in the population of midlying and upper CO2 vibrational levels being underpredicted by multiple orders of magnitude. Additionally, the two-temperature approach (in comparison to bin-based StS) overpredicts the rate of CO2 dissociation thereby leading to erroneous estimates for flow properties in the postshock region (primary source of afterbody radiative emission). This results in inflated values for surface radiative heat flux with two-temperature modeling, although overall differences in radiative behavior are tempered by the fast characteristic relaxation times for ground vibrational levels.},

 abstract = {A non-equilibrium model for laser generated plasmas is validated and used to investigate plasma kernel dynamics. Breakdowns in quiescent air at different ambient conditions (e.g. pressure) for different laser parameters (e.g. power density and beam wavelength) are considered. The hydrodynamics is described based on the chemically reactive Navier–Stokes equations where non-equilibrium effects are accounted for using a three-temperature model. Laser-plasma interactions over nano-second time-scales are modeled with a radiative transfer equation (RTE), including both multiphoton ionization (MPI) and inverse Bremsstrahlung (IB). Validation is conducted by comparing absorbed energy and plasma emission with the corresponding experimental measurements, and by observations of the structure of the breakdown. The laser generated plasma exhibits a two-lobe structure, developing both in the forward and backward directions. An analysis of the dynamics suggests that the kernel evolution results from a radiation-driven wave that is: (i) triggered by MPI, (ii) sustained by energy deposition in IB interactions, which compensates for the energy lost by free-electrons in ionizing collisions, and (iii) guided by both MPI and ionization by electron impact (IE).},

@article{pub.1122553238,
 abstract = {Radiative transfer calculations in complex three-dimensional domains are plagued by computational bottlenecks due to the combined cost of resolving spectral, angular, and spatial dependence. The current work presents a systematic study into the efficacy of three commonly used reduced-order wide-band models, Planck-averaging, and statistics-based k-distribution and theory of homogenization, for modeling non-equilibrium radiation. A reinterpretation of Planck-averaging based on the maximum entropy principle combined with the commonly used multi-band opacity binning allows a direct equivalence to be drawn with the two statistics-based approaches. Additionally, the three seemingly distinct methods are shown to be strictly derived only for local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions which limits their accuracy when simulating non-equilibrium radiation. This shortcoming is addressed through the development of a novel grouping strategy for defining larger groups of individual frequencies from detailed radiation databases (based on line-by-line or narrow-band models) while accounting for variation in all radiative properties under non-equilibrium. Radiative transfer calculations for different Earth and Jupiter entry problems are performed using the different spectral models. Conventional reduced-order wide-band approaches converge slowly to the solution obtained using detailed spectral models. However, the new non-equilibrium grouping strategy allows both total quantities-of-interest and their detailed spectral variation to be predicted accurately while employing fewer reduced-order groups. The current model-reduction methodology provides nearly two orders-of-magnitude decrease in required spectral evaluations along a given line-of-sight with respect to narrow-band methods (and three to four orders with respect to original LBL databases) and is ideal for coupled flow-radiation calculations.},

The gas is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, with non-equilibrium effects taken into account by means of a two-temperature model. The space-time dependence of the laser beam is modeled with a flux-tube formulation for the Radiative Transfer Equation. The flow governing equations are discretized in space using a second-order finite volume method. The semi-discrete equations are marched in time using an implicit-explicit (IMEX) dual time-stepping strategy, where diffusion and chemistry are solved implicitly, whereas convection is explicit. Application to a 20 ns long 50 mJ pulse laser-induced breakdown in quiescent O2 shows the advantages of this temporal discretization during and just after the laser pulse, while a less-expensive symmetric Strang splitting (with implicit chemistry) is sufficient for the post-breakdown gas dynamics after ≃ 0.1 μs.

 abstract = {This work deals with the development and application of reduced-order models for non-equilibrium hypersonic air flows. Starting from a State-to-State formulation, the reduction of kinetics mechanism to a more tractable form for Computational-Fluid-Dynamics (CFD) applications is realized by grouping the atom/molecule internal states within bins with prescribed population distributions. The group/bin-averaged kinetic parameters (e.g., rate coefficients) are computed in conjunction with Quasi-Classical-Trajectory (QCT) calculations. This allows for treating diatom-diatom systems (e.g., N2-N2) for which a State-to-State method is simply impractical. The proposed physico-chemical models are first compared against State-to-State formulations in zero and one-dimensional configurations to assess their accuracy, and later applied to realistic multi-dimensional simulations to demonstrate their maturity and predictive capabilities.},

The StS method is a deterministic method, which relies on pre-computed kinetic data used in the master equation for each rovibrational energy state. The DMS method is a stochastic interpretation of molecular dynamics, directly tracking the changes in energy of particles due to collisions. Using both methods we study a simple zero-dimensional heat bath in which initially cold nitrogen molecules are instantaneously heated to between 5 000 K and 20 000 K. To isolate the effect of the N2-N collision processes, we ignore any reactions due to collisions between two molecules. We find that both methods are in excellent agreement in the temperature range studied, with both macroscopic (composition and average internal energies) and microscopic (distribution of internal energy states) properties matching throughout the energy transfer and dissociation processes.},

 abstract = {Reliable computational prediction and modeling of high-enthalpy, hypersonic flows for certain aerospace applications are challenging due to coupling of multiphysics phenomena. The goal is to address some of the major gaps in existing hypersonic flow solvers, specifically the coupling of thermochemical nonequilibrium processes and turbulence. The primary issues considered with this coupling are the reliability of predictions over realistic geometries and the computational costs for its role in the design cycle. We extend the capability for aero-optical applications that is currently lacking in the existing hypersonic flow solvers. The authors are currently developing a computational tool for analysis of laminar and turbulent hypersonic external flow fields in non-equilibrium for a desired fidelity (high/low) using criteria driven by considerations of computational efficiency and accuracy of prediction, often provided by the design team. The paper describes the main features of the code, viz. numerical schemes (such as high-order accurate schemes), physical models (such as libraries for state-to-state kinetics solving master equation, lumped vibrational relaxation models and transport coefficients) and pre/post-processing modules. Validation tests and illustrative examples are presented to show its current state in the development.},

 abstract = {This work addresses the construction of a reduced-order model based on a multigroup maximum entropy formulation for application to high-enthalpy nonequilibrium flows. The method seeks a piecewise quadratic representation of the internal energy-state populations by lumping internal energy levels into groups and by applying the maximum entropy principle in conjunction with the method of moments. The use of higher-order polynomials allows for an accurate representation of the logarithm of the distribution of the low-lying energy states, while preserving an accurate description of the linear portions of the logarithm of the distribution function that characterize the intermediate- and high-energy states. A comparison of the quadratic and the linear reconstructions clearly demonstrates how the higher-order reconstruction provides a more accurate representation of the internal population distribution function at a modest increase in the computational cost. Numerical simulations carried out under conditions relevant to hypersonic flight reveal that the proposed model is able to capture the dynamics of the nonequilibrium distribution function using as few as three groups, thereby reducing the computational costs for simulations of nonequilibrium flows.},

 abstract = {A non-equilibrium model for laser-generated plasmas is used to represent collinear dual nano-second-pulse interactions. In the specific case considered, the breakdown is initiated with an ultraviolet (UV) laser pulse at 266 nm, which pre-ionizes the gas, and it is followed by a near-infrared (NIR) pulse at 1064 nm, which deposits significant energy into the ionized mixture. The model is validated against corresponding experiments, and simulation results are interrogated to understand key features of the plasma-kernel dynamics and the post-discharge hydrodynamics. The hydrodynamics of the non-equilibrium plasma is governed by the two-temperature NavierStokes equations accounting for both multiphoton ionization and inverse bremsstrahlung. The interaction between the laser beam and the plasma is modeled based on the radiative transfer equation. The temporal and spatial offsets of the two pulses can generate ionization kernels with different topology and dynamics. It is shown that the UV pre-ionization pulse can tailor the plasma region, leading to a larger ionized volume than would occur for a single-pulse breakdown, and it increases the efficiency of the energy deposition for the following NIR discharge. Vorticity in the early post-discharge phase is generated via baroclinic torque from the misalignment of the radial gradient of density (sudden gas expansion) and the strong pressure gradient (initiated by energy deposition from the laser beam). It is predicted that the collinear dual pulse can be designed to specify the plasma kernel size, shape, and maximum temperature in the breakdown phase, and the initial post-breakdown vorticity and plasma-core decay.},

 abstract = {This work introduces a novel methodology for the quantification of uncertainties associated with potential energy surfaces (PESs) computed from first-principles quantum mechanical calculations. The methodology relies on Bayesian inference and machine learning techniques to construct a stochastic PES and to express the inadequacies associated with the ab initio data points and their fit. By combining high fidelity calculations and reduced-order modeling, the resulting stochastic surface is efficiently forward propagated via quasi-classical trajectory and master equation calculations. In this way, the PES contribution to the uncertainty on predefined quantities of interest (QoIs) is explicitly determined. This study is done at both microscopic (e.g., rovibrational-specific rate coefficients) and macroscopic (e.g., thermal and chemical relaxation properties) levels. A correlation analysis is finally applied to identify the PES regions that require further refinement, based on their effects on the QoI reliability. The methodology is applied to the study of singlet (1<sup>1</sup>A') and quintet (2<sup>5</sup>A') PESs describing the interaction between O<sub>2</sub> molecules and O atoms in their ground electronic state. The investigation of the singlet surface reveals a negligible uncertainty on the kinetic properties and relaxation times, which are found to be in excellent agreement with the ones previously published in the literature. On the other hand, the methodology demonstrated significant uncertainty on the quintet surface, due to inaccuracies in the description of the exchange barrier and the repulsive wall. When forward propagated, this uncertainty is responsible for the variability of 1 order of magnitude in the vibrational relaxation time and of factor four in the exchange reaction rate coefficient, both at 2500 K.},

 abstract = {We present a detailed comparison of two high-fidelity approaches for simulating non-equilibrium chemical processes in gases: the state-to-state master equation (StS-ME) and the direct molecular simulation (DMS) methods. The former is a deterministic method, which relies on the pre-computed kinetic database for the N<sub>2</sub>-N system based on the NASA Ames <i>ab initio</i> potential energy surface (PES) to describe the evolution of the molecules' internal energy states through a system of master equations. The latter is a stochastic interpretation of molecular dynamics relying exclusively on the same <i>ab initio</i> PES. It directly tracks the microscopic gas state through a particle ensemble undergoing a sequence of collisions. We study a mixture of nitrogen molecules and atoms forced into strong thermochemical non-equilibrium by sudden exposure of rovibrationally cold gas to a high-temperature heat bath. We observe excellent agreement between the DMS and StS-ME predictions for the transfer rates of translational into rotational and vibrational energy, as well as of dissociation rates across a wide range of temperatures. Both methods agree down to the microscopic scale, where they predict the same non-Boltzmann population distributions during quasi-steady-state dissociation. Beyond establishing the equivalence of both methods, this cross-validation helped in reinterpreting the NASA Ames kinetic database and resolve discrepancies observed in prior studies. The close agreement found between the StS-ME and DMS methods, whose sole model inputs are the PESs, lends confidence to their use as benchmark tools for studying high-temperature air chemistry.},

 abstract = {This work presents an in-depth discussion on the nonequilibrium dissociation of O<sub>2</sub> molecules colliding with O atoms, combining quasi-classical trajectory calculations, master equation, and dimensionality reduction. A rovibrationally resolved database for all of the elementary collisional processes is constructed by including all nine adiabatic electronic states of O<sub>3</sub> in the QCT calculations. A detailed analysis of the <i>ab initio</i> data set reveals that for a rovibrational level, the probability of dissociating is mostly dictated by its deficit in internal energy compared to the centrifugal barrier. Because of the assumption of rotational equilibrium, the conventional vibrational-specific calculations fail to characterize such a dependence. Based on this observation, a new physics-based grouping strategy for application to coarse-grained models is proposed. By relying on a hybrid technique made of rovibrationally resolved excitation coupled to coarse-grained dissociation, the new approach is compared to the vibrational-specific model and the direct solution of the rovibrational state-to-state master equation. Simulations are performed in a zero-dimensional isothermal and isochoric chemical reactor for a wide range of temperatures (1500-20,000 K). The study shows that the main contribution to the model inadequacy of vibrational-specific approaches originates from the incapability of characterizing dissociation, rather than the energy transfers. Even when constructed with only twenty groups, the new reduced-order model outperforms the vibrational-specific one in predicting all of the QoIs related to dissociation kinetics. At the highest temperature, the accuracy in the mole fraction is improved by 2000%.},

 abstract = {We present applications of laser-energy deposition for drag reduction in supersonic flow. The system of chemically reactive Navier–Stokes equations describes the hydrodynamics where nonequilibrium effects are accounted for by means of a two-temperature model. The propagation and attenuation of the laser beam are modeled based on a kinetic approach for photons (radiative transfer equation). Multiphoton ionization, inverse bremsstrahlung (free-free radiation), cascade ionization, and shock hydrodynamics are coupled self-consistently without imposing an initial plasma seed to initiate the breakdown, as is often done in the literature. Simulations are conducted in supersonic airflow over a spherical blunt body to study the control of aerodynamic forces. Results confirm that the laser-induced thermal spot can be effectively used to control the shock structures with beneficial effects in terms of aerodynamic loads. As a matter of fact, the interaction of the downstream advected hot spot with the bow shock distorts the latter (the lensing effect) and leads to toroidal vortices due to baroclinic torque. Drag is momentarily decreased due to the formation of an expansion fan (related to the upstream movement of the bow shock) that generates a load reduction on the wall, as well as to the advection of the vortex region that remains attached to the wall. The results also demonstrate that the self-consistent computational framework is able to handle complex multiscale multiphysics flow control problems for predictive applications without the assistance of tuning parameters and/or simplifying assumptions inferred from the experiments.},

A novel atomistic quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) method with a modified approach is devised to drastically reduce computational cost, and rigorously model the rotational relaxation time of N2 in N2–N and N2–N2 collisions. The calculated full sets of rotational state-to-state transition rates obtained by the QCT method are fed into the rotational state-resolved master equations to determine the rotational relaxation time of N2. Clear discrepancies are observed when the present rotational relaxation time is compared with existing empirical data for N2. The existing empirical model is utilized to determine the rotational relaxation time of other atmospheric gas species. Then the present set of rotational relaxation times for the air mixture is employed to predict the hypersonic shock standoff distance over a blunt body of the ground and flight experiments. Compared with the results from the two-temperature model, the rotational nonequilibrium enlarges the hypersonic shock standoff distance. This increase in shock standoff distance by the rotational nonequilibrium is attributed to the delay in chemical reactions inside the shock layers. The accuracy of the predicted measured shock standoff distance is improved by considering the present rotational relaxation time of the air mixture.},

Time scales for electron recombination, thermal relaxation, and diffusion are compared to that of the plasma expansion to anticipate conditions in which these mechanisms might affect the vorticity generation that leads to the ultimate flow pattern. The effect of these mechanisms are analyzed through comparison with corresponding inert-gas and equilibrium models. Thermal-nonequilibrium effects are found to be weak due to rapid relaxation of the heavy-particle and electronic temperatures. In contrast, chemical equilibration occurs at a rate comparable to the expansion and thereby enhance both it and subsequent hydrodynamic mechanisms as the energy stored in ion formation during the preceding breakdown is released by electron recombination.

The state-to-state kinetic database utilized for the master equation analysis includes N2+N2, N2+N, N2+O, O2+O2, O2+O, and NO+N systems. A novel investigation is done to calculate the rovibrational-specific rate coefficients of diatom+diatom collisional systems by means of the coarse-grain quasi-classical trajectory method. In the integration of the set of master equations, all of the considered kinetic processes are included together. The analysis in the present study reveals that the coupling phenomena between the dissociation reaction and internal energy transfer is governed by different chemical systems in the beginning of a molecular quasi-steady state period, and in its end region. In addition, the chemistry-internal energy coupling represents significantly different behavior along with rotational states for a given vibrational level for both the dissociation and heterogeneous exchange reactions. This observation implies the importance of rotational nonequilibrium in modeling of high-temperature air mixture. Finally, comparison of the present result with existing numerical models reveals significant level of discrepancy in species concentration evolution that motivates extension of the present work to wider range of temperatures as future investigation.},

This paper presents the construction of the ground state singlet HCN potential energy surface (PES), $^1A'$ and state-to-state (StS) kinetics of the molecule-atom systems associated with HCN. The ground state HCN surface is associated to the ground state of CN ($^2\Sigma^+$) and NH ($^3\Sigma^-$) and the first excited state of CH ($^4\Sigma^-$). Multi-reference configuration interaction calculations are used to compute the ab-initio points on a grid of geometries for the diatomic potentials and the full PES. A total of 11688 ab-initio points are used to construct the potential energy surface.The diatomic potentials are fit to the Modified Morse functional form and the potential energy surface fit is obtained using a permutationally invariant polynomial neural network (PIP-NN). The RMS error in the potential energy surface fit are is upto 0.2 eV in the 0-25 eV energy range. The PES constructed highlights some important topological features. Firstly, the exchange of CH and NH to CN is barrier-less and second, the potential energy surface is characterized by two deep wells corresponding to HCN and HNC molecules in their ground singlet states. The considerably larger depth of the CN molecule diatomic potential and the barrier-less exchange pathway make exchange reactions and exchange assisted dissociation important kinetic features of the system. The potential energy surface constructed is used to carry out quasi-classical trajectory calculations followed by state-to-state isothermal heat bath simulations to study macroscopic quantities of interest to atmospheric entry. Furthermore, the exchange associated dissociation in CH and NH causes the dissociation to happen an order of magnitude faster in time when compared to only direct dissociation with the contribution due to exchange being $84.7\%$ and $82.5\%$ in the dissociation source terms, respectively.},

Simulating the response of a thermal protection system to different flight conditions provides time dependent, spatial information for all regions of the material, but such simulations are difficult to perform accurately and can incur large computational expense for geometrically and thermochemically complex materials.

 abstract = {View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-1639.vid Simulating non-equilibrium hypersonic flows by relying on high fidelity state-to-state kinetics is computationally intensive. The cost is determined by the high computational load associated with the solution of underlying master equations, which predict the evolution of the species mass fractions and the rovibrational distribution functions by considering energy exchange and dissociation processes. In this work, a machine learning (ML)-based approach is developed for accelerating numerical simulations of such computationally expensive flows. A physics-informed DeepONet (PI-DeepONet), i.e. a deep operator network (DeepONet) trained in the physics-informed (PI) fashion, is constructed to learn the solution operator of coarse-grained (CG) kinetic master equations. Based on this approach, the coarse-grained description reduces the dimensionality of the stiff master equations, while the ML-based surrogation bypasses their numerical integration. Simultaneously, the physics-informed attribute of the ML model, given by appropriate choices of loss functions, constraints, and inference algorithms, enforces predictions that respect the underlying non-equilibrium physics. The proposed framework is meant to investigate rovibrational relaxations and dissociation of gas mixtures, and it is here tested on the O₂-O mixture. The novel ML tool outperforms the numerical integrators by two orders of magnitude in speedup with an error smaller than 2%. This work lays the foundation for an efficient ML- and CG-based surrogation to be coupled with CFD simulations for accurately characterizing the thermochemical non-equilibrium.},

 abstract = {View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-1703.vid The predictive accuracy of the Navier–Stokes equations is known to degrade at the limits of the continuum assumption, for example, in rarefied and/or nonequilibrium gases, thereby necessitating expensive and often highly approximate solutions to the Boltzmann equation. While tractable in one spatial dimension, their high dimensionality (n physical plus three phase-space) makes multidimensional Boltzmann calculations impractical for all but canonical configurations. It is therefore desirable to augment the accuracy of the Navier–Stokes equations in these regimes. We present an application of a deep learning (DL) method to extend the validity of the Navier–Stokes equations to the transitional flow regime. It works by encoding the “missing” (i.e., sub-continuum) physics in the Navier–Stokes equations via a neural network, which is trained by targeting density, velocity, and energy profiles obtained from direct Boltzmann solutions. While standard DL methods (e.g., those developed for image recognition, language processing, etc.) can be considered ad-hoc due to the absence of underlying physical laws, at least in the sense that the systems are not governed by known partial differential equations (PDEs), the DL framework applied here leverages the a priori-known Boltzmann physics while ensuring that the trained model is consistent with the Navier–Stokes PDEs. The online training procedure solves adjoint PDEs, which efficiently provide the gradient of the loss function with respect to the forward PDE solution. The adjoint PDEs are automatically constructed using algorithmic differentiation (AD). The model is trained and applied to predict shock thickness in low-pressure argon. The resulting DL-augmented Navier–Stokes equations have comparable accuracy to the target Boltzmann solutions. Extensions to other regimes and gas flows are discussed for future work.},

Results of the investigation show that propagated quantified parametric uncertainty extracted from test facility data, as is typically done, underestimate total uncertainty quantified using flight data and additional modeling uncertainty extrapolation approaches must be developed. Moreover, uncertainty in extrapolated model predictions for flight conditions is insufficient and does not adequately capture recorded flight data without the use of ad hoc solutions.},

Chemically reactive Navier–Stokes equations are used to describe the hydrodynamics, and non-equilibrium effects are taken into account with a two-temperature model. Inverse Bremsstrahlung and multiphoton ionization are included self-consistently in the model via a coupled solution of the plasma governing equations and the radiative transfer equation (that describes the laser beam propagation and attenuation). A self-consistent approach (despite carrying additional challenges) minimizes the empiricism and it allows for a more accurate description since it prevents both the utilization of artificial plasma seeds to trigger the breakdown and the implementation of tuning parameters to simulate the laser-energy deposition. The advantages of this approach are confirmed by the good agreement between the numerically predicted and the experimentally measured plasma boundary evolution and absorbed energy. This also holds true for the periodic plasma kernel structures that, as suggested by the experiments and confirmed by the simulations presented here, are connected to the modulating frequency.},

Additionally, in-situ scanning electron microscopy was carried out on spin-coated RTV samples to observe in-situ the microstructure change as a function of temperature.

In it, we solve the transport equation for radiation leveraging a low order spherical harmonic expansion, P1, to describe the angular dependence of the radiative intensity. This radiation model is tightly coupled with CHyPS, a material response solver developed within the CHESS that can simulate the heat and mass transfer in porous materials. CHyPS solves volume-averaged governing conservation equations for solid mass, gas mass, species (finite-rate chemistry), momentum, and energy. Model predictions are compared against several test cases published in literature demonstrating excellent agreement in the predictions. Finally, we present a demonstrative simulation of the heat shield used for the Dragonfly mission's entry capsule.},

 abstract = {Understanding the kinetics of the HCN system is critical to several disciplines in science and engineering, including interstellar chemistry, atmospheric reentry, and combustion, to name a few. This paper constructs a rovibrational state-specific kinetic mechanism for the HCN system, leveraging electronic structure calculations, classical scattering dynamics, and state-to-state kinetics. To this aim, three accurate potential energy surfaces (PESs), <sup>1</sup><i>A</i>', <sup>3</sup><i>A</i>', and <sup>3</sup><i>A</i>″, are constructed using multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) calculations for a comprehensive arrangement of the nuclei. Quasi-classical scattering calculations provide elementary reaction rate constants resulting from the interaction between the CN, CH, and NH molecules with H, N, and C atoms, respectively. The rovibrational collisional model developed comprises 50 million bound-bound and free-bound collisional processes. This model is used to study the dynamics of energy transfer and dissociation in an isochoric and isothermal chemical reactor <i>via</i> the solution of the master equation for a wide temperature range from 1000 to 10,000 K. This study unravels the dynamics of dissociation of the molecules in the HCN system, which the PESs primarily control <i>via</i> the formation of short-lived intermediates that shortcut the dissociation pathway. The exchange processes in CH and NH enhance the dissociation by over 80%. The importance of exchange processes is also highlighted in comparing the quasi-steady state and thermal dissociation rates with state-of-the-art rate models and experimental fits.},

@article{pub.1152337418,
 abstract = {This work proposes a new machine learning (ML)-based paradigm aiming to
enhance the computational efficiency of non-equilibrium reacting flow
simulations while ensuring compliance with the underlying physics. The
framework combines dimensionality reduction and neural operators through a
hierarchical and adaptive deep learning strategy to learn the solution of
multi-scale coarse-grained governing equations for chemical kinetics. The
proposed surrogate's architecture is structured as a tree, with leaf nodes
representing separate neural operator blocks where physics is embedded in the
form of multiple soft and hard constraints. The hierarchical attribute has two
advantages: i) It allows the simplification of the training phase via transfer
learning, starting from the slowest temporal scales; ii) It accelerates the
prediction step by enabling adaptivity as the surrogate's evaluation is limited
to the necessary leaf nodes based on the local degree of non-equilibrium of the
gas. The model is applied to the study of chemical kinetics relevant for
application to hypersonic flight, and it is tested here on pure oxygen gas
mixtures. In 0-D scenarios, the proposed ML framework can adaptively predict
the dynamics of almost thirty species with a maximum relative error of 4.5% for
a wide range of initial conditions. Furthermore, when employed in 1-D shock
simulations, the approach shows accuracy ranging from 1% to 4.5% and a speedup
of one order of magnitude compared to conventional implicit schemes employed in
an operator-splitting integration framework. Given the results presented in the
paper, this work lays the foundation for constructing an efficient ML-based
surrogate coupled with reactive Navier-Stokes solvers for accurately
characterizing non-equilibrium phenomena in multi-dimensional computational
fluid dynamics simulations.},

 abstract = {This work constructs a rovibrational state-to-state model for the
$\text{O}_2$+$\text{O}_2$ system leveraging high-fidelity potential energy
surfaces and quasi-classical trajectory calculations. The model is used to
investigate internal energy transfer and non-equilibrium reactive processes in
dissociating environment using a master equation approach, whereby the kinetics
of each internal rovibrational state is explicitly computed. To cope with the
exponentially large number of elementary processes that characterize reactive
bimolecular collisions, the internal states of the collision partner are
assumed to follow a Boltzmann distribution at a prescribed internal
temperature. This procedure makes the problem tractable, reducing the
computational cost to a comparable scale with the $\text{O}_2$+O system. The
constructed rovibrational-specific kinetic database covers the temperature
range of 7500-20000 K. The analysis of the energy transfer and dissociation
process in isochoric and isothermal conditions reveals that significant
departures from the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution occur during the energy
transfer and dissociation phase. Comparing the population distribution of the
$\text{O}_2$ molecules against the $\text{O}_2$+O demonstrates a more
significant extent of non-equilibrium characterized by a more diffuse
distribution whereby the vibrational strands are more clearly identifiable.
This is partly due to a less efficient mixing of the rovibrational states,
which results in more diffuse rovibrational distributions in the
quasi-steady-state distribution. The master equation analysis for the combined
$\text{O}_3$+$\text{O}_4$ system reveals that the $\text{O}_2$+$\text{O}_2$
governs the early stage of energy transfer, while the $\text{O}_2$+O takes
control of the dissociation dynamics. The findings will provide strong physical
foundations for future development of oxygen chemistry.},

Furthermore, we carry out a StS master equation analysis of an isochoric, isothermal heat bath simulation at various temperatures to study how the predicted rate coefficients impact the accuracy of multiple quantities of interest (QoIs) at the kinetics level (\textit{e.g.}, global quasi-steady state (QSS) dissociation rate coefficients and energy relaxation times).

@article{pub.1153830417,
 abstract = {This works discusses the high temperature decomposition of Room Temperature Vulcanized (RTV) silicone, an adhesive material used as a gap filler in ablative heatshield for planetary atmospheric entry, and in fire-protection applications. The high temperature behavior of RTV is characterized by intumescence, shrinkage, foaming and formation of a glassy char. In heatshield applications, these phenomena lead to a mismatch between the ablative response of RTV and that of carbon-phenolic tiles, posing numerous design challenges such as tile layout selection, installation of heatshield sensors, prediction of laminar-to-turbulence transition and assessment of heatshield robustness. The ablation response of RTV is not modeled in current design tools because of the lack of data on its high temperature behavior. In this paper, thermogravimetric analysis was conducted to quantify the mass-loss of RTV during pyrolysis, as a function of heating rate. Samples were imaged using environmental scanning electron microscopy at high temperature to observe the microstructural evolution of RTV during charring. Helium pycnometry, mercury intrusion porosimetry and nitrogen adsorption techniques, combined with micro-tomography imaging, were used to quantify the pore size distribution and porosity of charred RTV. Results show that the porosity of charred RTV is about 82% and that the predominant pore sizes are 2, 23, 39 and 98 microns. The net volumetric swelling due to pyrolysis of the material was found to be 10% when heated to 1000  ° C. Physical phenomena occurring during high temperature decomposition are discussed based on the experimental observations.},

 abstract = {This work proposes a new machine learning (ML)-based paradigm aiming to enhance the computational efficiency of non-equilibrium reacting flow simulations while ensuring compliance with the underlying physics. The framework combines dimensionality reduction and neural operators through a hierarchical and adaptive deep learning strategy to learn the solution of multi-scale coarse-grained governing equations for chemical kinetics. The proposed surrogate’s architecture is structured as a tree, with leaf nodes representing separate neural operator blocks where physics is embedded in the form of multiple soft and hard constraints. The hierarchical attribute has two advantages: (i) It allows the simplification of the training phase via transfer learning, starting from the slowest temporal scales; (ii) It accelerates the prediction step by enabling adaptivity as the surrogate’s evaluation is limited to the necessary leaf nodes based on the local degree of non-equilibrium of the gas. The model is applied to the study of chemical kinetics relevant for application to hypersonic flight, and it is tested here on pure oxygen gas mixtures. In 0-D$$\textrm{D}$$ scenarios, the proposed ML framework can adaptively predict the dynamics of almost thirty species with a maximum relative error of 4.5% for a wide range of initial conditions. Furthermore, when employed in 1-D$$\textrm{D}$$ shock simulations, the approach shows accuracy ranging from 1% to 4.5% and a speedup of one order of magnitude compared to conventional implicit schemes employed in an operator-splitting integration framework. Given the results presented in the paper, this work lays the foundation for constructing an efficient ML-based surrogate coupled with reactive Navier-Stokes solvers for accurately characterizing non-equilibrium phenomena in multi-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulations.},

@article{pub.1164676156,
 abstract = {This work presents a vibrational and electronic state-to-state model for
nitrogen plasma implemented within a multi-physics modular computational
framework to study non-equilibrium effects in inductively coupled plasma (ICP)
discharges. Within the computational framework, the set of vibronic (i.e.,
vibrational and electronic) master equations are solved in a tightly coupled
fashion with the flow governing equations. This tight coupling eliminates the
need for invoking any simplifying assumptions when computing the state of the
plasma, thereby ensuring a higher degree of physical fidelity. To mitigate
computational complexity, a maximum entropy coarse-graining strategy is
deployed, effectively truncating the internal state space. The efficacy of this
reduced StS model is empirically substantiated through zero-dimensional
isochoric simulations. In these simulations, the results obtained from the
reduced-order model are rigorously compared against those obtained from the
full StS model, thereby confirming the accuracy of the reduced StS framework.
The developed Coarse-grained StS model was employed to study the plasma
discharge within the VKI Plasmatron facility. Our results reveal pronounced
discrepancies between the plasma flow fields obtained from StS simulations and
those derived from Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) models, which are
conventionally used in the simulation of such facilities. The analysis
demonstrates a substantial departure of the internal state populations of atoms
and molecules from the Boltzmann distribution. These nonequilibrium effects
have important consequences on the energy coupling dynamics, thereby impacting
the overall morphology of the plasma discharge. A deeper analysis of the
results demonstrates that the population distribution is in a
Quasi-Steady-State in the hot plasma core.},

 abstract = {This paper provides a comparison between the vibrational-specific
state-to-state (StS) model for nitrogen plasma elaborated in Part I of this
work and conventional two-temperature (2-T) models for simulating inductively
coupled plasma (ICP) discharges under non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium
(NLTE) conditions. Simulations are performed within the multi-physics
computational framework established for ICP in Part I. Based on the findings of
Part I, the quasi-steady-state (QSS) assumption is validated in the plasma
core, thereby enabling the calculation of global rate coefficients under this
assumption. This facilitates the reduction of the StS model to a "consistent"
macroscopic 2-T model. Results from the StS model for nitrogen ICP torch
exhibit considerable discrepancies when compared against predictions from the
widely utilized Park 2-T model. On the contrary, the comparison between the
newly proposed 2-T model, consistently derived from the original vibronic StS
model, and the full StS results demonstrate excellent agreement in terms of
plasma core location, morphology, and peak temperature distributions. This
demonstrates the ability of the proposed 2-T model to capture the energy
transfer and reactive processes predicted by the comprehensive StS model.
Additionally, the study identifies the vibrational-translational (VT) energy
transfer term in the 2-T model as the predominant factor in dictating plasma
core morphology. This suggests a strong sensitivity of the ICP flow field to
heavy-impact vibrational excitations and dissociative events.},

Unlike a monolithic approach, the hydrodynamics and electromagnetic field are handled by separate solvers, all developed within the Center for Hypersonics and Entry Systems Studies (CHESS) at the University of Illinois. Hydrodynamics is modeled using HEGEL, a finite volume solver for non-equilibrium plasmas. This solver is interfaced with the PLATO library, which is responsible for evaluating all plasma-related quantities (e.g., thermodynamic and transport properties). The electric field is handled by FLUX, a finite element solver. Coupling is realized using the PRECICE open-source library.

A preconditioned compressible formulation is adopted to tackle the stiffness resulting from low Mach numbers. Non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) calculations are performed using either multi-temperature or State-to-State models. Electromagnetic equations are solved via a mixed finite element method. Two solvers, one for the fluid and the other for the electromagnetic phenomena, are coupled in an explicit fashion to model NLTE ICP discharges. Calculations performed using a two-temperature NLTE model highlight the importance of non-equilibrium modeling in the torch. Further, simulations performed using an electronic State-to-State model show significant deviations of the population of high-lying states from local equilibrium (e.g., Boltzmann distribution).},

 abstract = {We present a new framework towards the objective of learning coarse-grained models based on the maximum entropy principle. We show that existing methods for assigning clusters using the maximum entropy approach are heuristic or sub-optimal. We propose a machine learning framework informed by rate-distortion theory to learn optimal cluster assignments, aiming to improve the effectiveness of the coarse-graining process. Our approach involves transforming the discrete optimization problem into a probabilistic and continuous form. Our inverse modeling approach involves the development of a fully differentiable, adjoint-driven dynamics solver for use with gradient-based optimization techniques. The entire framework is end-to-end differentiable, facilitating backward pass gradient computation to flow through the ODE solve and probabilistic coarse-graining to train a classifier. We demonstrate application in the evolution of particle quantum states in non-equilibrium conditions. The high dimensionality of these equations poses a significant challenge for efficient and accurate computations, even for seemingly simple chemical systems. Training is performed using a loss function informed by rate-distortion theory to cluster the rovibrational states of some molecule, effectively forming a reduced order model of the master equations. We also introduce variable transformations along with several ways of improving the tractability of the training process. These allow the framework to process the extremely high-dimensional discrete optimization problem successfully. Our method is general, and to demonstrate the effectiveness in a controlled setting, we apply it to a one-dimensional Gaussian source quantization problem for which an analytical solution is known, followed by the problem of isothermal relaxation of a Image 1 system with O ( 10 4 ) degrees of freedom.},
