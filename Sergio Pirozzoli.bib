 abstract = {The effect of Reynolds and Mach number variation in compressible isothermal channel flow is investigated through a series of direct numerical simulations (DNS), at bulk Mach number Mb=1.5,3 and bulk Reynolds number up to Reb=34000, which is sufficient to sense sizeable high-Reynolds-number effects not reached before in this type of flow. Dedicated incompressible DNS are also performed at precisely matching Reynolds number, to directly gauge the performance of compressibility transformations for the mean velocity profiles and Reynolds stresses. As in previous studies, we find inaccuracy of the classical van Driest transformation to remove effects of variable density and viscosity, especially at low Reynolds number. On the other hand, almost perfect matching of incompressible mean velocity and Reynolds stress distributions is recovered throughout the wall layer by using a recently introduced transformation (Trettel and Larsson, 2014,2016), the only remaining effect of compressibility being the increase of the streamwise turbulence intensity peak with the Mach number. Temperature/velocity relations are scrutinized, with the main finding that a recent relation by Zhang et al. (2014), which explicitly accounts for finite wall heat flux, is more accurate than the classical Walz relation. The size of the typical turbulent eddies is studied through spanwise spectral densities of the velocity field, which support validity of a scaling based on the local mean shear and the local friction velocity, with the main conclusion that the actual size of the eddies does not vary with the Mach number, at a fixed outer wall distance.},

 abstract = {The structure of wall pressure fluctuations beneath a turbulent boundary layer interacting with a normal shock wave is investigated through direct numerical simulation (DNS). In the zeropressure-gradient (ZPG) region upstream of the interaction pressure statistics well compare with canonical boundary layers in terms of fluctuation intensities and frequency spectra. Across the interaction zone, the r.m.s. wall pressure fluctuations attain large values (in excess of ≈162dB), with an increase of about 7dB from the upstream level. The main effect of the interaction on the frequency spectra is to enhance of the low-frequency Fourier modes, while inhibiting the high-frequency ones. Excellent collapse of frequency spectra is observed past the interaction zone when data are scaled with the local boundary layer units. In this region an extended ω−7/3 power-law behavior is observed, which is associated with the suppression of mean shear caused by the imposed adverse pressure gradient.},

The flow statistics computed in the stationary frame exhibit significant discrepancies with respect to reference spectral data in terms of energy spectra and convection velocity of disturbances, especially in the near-wall region. On the other hand, simulations performed in a reference frame moving with the bulk flow velocity suffer from this shortcoming to a much lesser extent. We propose an explanation of these observations by assuming the scalar Burgers’ equation as working model. The analysis highlights the lack of Galilean invariance of finite-difference schemes, which exhibit a leading dispersive error in the presence of bulk advection.

 abstract = {We develop numerical boundary conditions for the compressible Navier–Stokes equations based on a generalized relaxation approach (GRCBC), which hinges on locally one-dimensional characteristic projection at the computational boundaries, supplemented with available information from the flow exterior. The basic idea is to estimate the amplitude of incoming characteristic waves through first-order one-sided finite-difference approximations which involve the value of the reference flow state at the first exterior (ghost) point. Unlike other characteristic-based relaxation methods, the present one requires minimal user-supplied input, including the reference flow state, which may be totally or partially known, and in general may vary both in space and time. Furthermore, it can be applied to any type of computational boundary, either inflow or outflow, either subsonic or supersonic. The method is theoretically predicted to convey reduced reflection of waves at computational boundaries compared to other ones, and to have better properties of frequency response to injected disturbances. Numerical tests confirm the improvement of the nonreflecting performance, and demonstrate high degree of flexibility, also for problems with non-trivial far-field boundary conditions (e.g. flows in rotating reference frames) and for the artificial stimulation of subsonic turbulent boundary layers.},

 abstract = {Abstract  The effect of the Reynolds number in a supersonic isothermal channel flow is studied using a direct numerical simulation (DNS). The bulk Mach number based on the wall temperature is 1.5, and the bulk Reynolds number is increased up to Re τ  ≈︁ 1000. The use of van Driest velocity transformation in the presence of heated walls has been questioned due to the poor accuracy at low Reynolds number. For this reason alternative transformations of the velocity profile and turbulence statistics have been proposed, as, for instance, semi‐local scalings. We show that the van Driest transformation recovers its accuracy as the Reynolds number is increased. The Reynolds stresses collapse on the incompressible ones, when properly scaled with density, and very good agreement with the incompressible stresses is found in the outer layer.

 abstract = {In the present paper, we gauge the performance of finite-difference schemes with Runge–Kutta time integration for wave propagation problems by rigorously defining appropriate cost and error metrics in a simple setting represented by the linear advection equation. Optimal values of the grid spacing and of the time step are obtained as a result of a cost minimization (for given error level) procedure. The theory suggests superior performance of high-order schemes when highly accurate solutions are sought for, and in several space dimensions even more. The analysis of the global discretization error shows the occurrence of two (approximately independent) sources of error, associated with the space and time discretizations. The improvement of the performance of finite-difference schemes can then be achieved by trying to separately minimize the two contributions. General guidelines for the design of problem-tailored, optimized schemes are provided, suggesting that significant reductions of the computational cost are in principle possible. The application of the analysis to wave propagation problems in a two-dimensional environment demonstrates that the analysis carried out for the scalar case directly applies to the propagation of monochromatic sound waves. For problems of sound propagation involving disparate length-scales the analysis still provides useful insight for the optimal exploitation of computational resources; however, the actual advantage provided by optimized schemes is not as evident as in the single-scale, scalar case.},

 abstract = {Three-dimensional time-resolved velocity field measurements are obtained using a high-speed tomographic Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system on a fully developed flat plate turbulent boundary layer for the estimation of wall pressure fluctuations. The work focuses on the applicability of tomographic PIV to compute the coherence of pressure fluctuations, with attention to the estimation of the stream and spanwise coherence length. The latter is required for estimations of aeroacoustic noise radiation by boundary layers and trailing edge flows, but is also of interest for vibro-structural problems. The pressure field is obtained by solving the Poisson equation for incompressible flows, where the source terms are provided by time-resolved velocity field measurements. Measured 3D velocity data is compared to results obtained from planar PIV, and a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) at similar Reynolds number. An improved method for the estimation of the material based on a least squares estimator of the velocity derivative along a particle trajectory is proposed and applied. Computed surface pressure fluctuations are further verified by means of simultaneous measurements by a pinhole microphone and compared to the DNS results and a semi-empirical model available from literature. The correlation coefficient for the reconstructed pressure time series with respect to pinhole microphone measurements attains approximately 0.5 for the band-pass filtered signal over the range of frequencies resolved by the velocity field measurements. Scaled power spectra of the pressure at a single point compare favorably to the DNS results and those available from literature. Finally, the coherence of surface pressure fluctuations and the resulting span- and streamwise coherence lengths are estimated and compared to semi-empirical models and DNS results.},

 abstract = {We propose a strategy to design locally conservative finite-difference approximations of convective derivatives for shock-free compressible flows with arbitrary order of accuracy, that generalizes the approach of Ducros et al. (2000) [1], and that can be applied as a building block of low-dissipative, hybrid shock-capturing methods. The approximations stem from application of standard central difference formulas to split forms of the convective terms in the compressible Euler equations, which guarantee strong numerical stability and (near) energy preservation in the inviscid limit. A convenient implementation of the high-order fluxes is suggested, which guarantees improved computational efficiency over existing methods. Numerical tests performed for isotropic turbulence at zero viscosity show stability of schemes with order of accuracy up to ten, and effectiveness of convective splitting of Kennedy and Gruber (2008) [2] in providing extra stability in the presence of strong density variations. Numerical simulations of compressible turbulent boundary layer flow indicate suitability of the method for non-uniform grids, and overall support superior computational efficiency of high-order schemes.},

A fourth-order, finite-difference solver capable of discretely preserving the total kinetic energy in the limit of inviscid flow is adopted to solve the compressible Navier–Stokes equations and model-consistent, adaptive wall functions are employed to provide proper numerical boundary conditions at the fluid/solid interface. Numerical tests, performed for several configurations involving massively separated flows, demonstrate that computations at high Reynolds number typically occurring in flows of industrial relevance can be successfully carried out using the immersed boundary strategy, providing predictions whose accuracy is comparable to that of standard, body-fitted, structured and unstructured flow solvers.},

 abstract = {The effect of large-scale turbulent structures on the motion of heavy particles in wall-bounded turbulent flows is investigated by mining a direct numerical simulation database of particle-laden turbulent Couette flow, and comparing the results with a turbulent Poiseuille at similar friction Reynolds number. It is shown that the large-scale structures found in the core of the Couette flow have an influence on the turbophoretic mechanism, leading to different distributions of the particle concentration. The main differences in the two flows are observed in the spatial distribution of the suspended phase, which is found to be strongly dependent on the structure of the underlying streamwise velocity field. In addition to the standard particle streaks in the inner layer, spaced at 100 wall units, typical of the Poiseuille flow, in the Couette case particles with non-negligible inertia respond to the large-scale structures of the core, by organizing themselves into large-scale rows whose typical spanwise separation is of the order of 4–5 channel half-height.},

 abstract = {The concept of a minimal flow unit (MFU) for the study of the basic physics of turbulent flows is introduced. The MFU is an initial vorticity configuration that consists of a few simple well-defined large-scale vortex structures. The form and position of these structures are chosen so that their interaction produces turbulence capturing many of the essential characteristics of isotropic homogeneous turbulence produced from random-phase initial conditions or that produced by continual random-phase forcing. The advantage of using the MFU is that the evolution of the vortex structures can be followed more clearly and the relationship between the evolving vortex structures and the various ranges in the energy spectrum can be more clearly defined. The addition of passive scalar fields to the MFU permits an investigation of passive scalar mixing that is relevant to the study of combustion. With a particular choice of the MFU, one that produces a trend to a finite-time singularity in the vorticity field, it is demonstrated that passive scalar distributed in the original large-scale vortices will develop intense gradients in the region where the vorticity is tending toward a singularity. In viscous flow, the evolution of the MFU clearly shows how the volume of the regions where originally well-separated passive scalars come into contact increases with increasing Reynolds number.},

 abstract = {Abstract: In this paper we study the interaction of a shock wave with a cylindrical vortex. The objective of the study is to characterize the shock and vortex deformations and the mechanism of sound generation. The approach relies on the solution of the two-dimensional Euler equations by means of a high order finite volume weighted-ENO scheme. In order to provide some guidance into the analysis we have also developed an acoustic analogy of the problem by formulating a wave equation for the pressure disturbance that is solved analytically by means of Green's functions. A systematic study has been conducted by investigating the effects of vortex intensity and shock strength. Specifically, we have determined the dependence of shock distortion and vortex compression, and its subsequent nutation upon shock and vortex strengths. The acoustic field generated through shock--vortex interactions has been found to evolve in three stages and to exhibit a three sound quadrupolar directivity. In the early stages of the interaction the sound generated due to shock distortion shows a dipolar character, which then changes to a quadrupolar one due to a restoring mechanism that acts during the interaction of the shock with the rear part of the vortex. In the third stage secondary sounds are formed, which also show a quadrupolar directivity. The acoustic analogy applied to weak shock--vortex interactions also confirms the numerically predicted sound generation mechanism.},

 abstract = {A family of space- and time-optimised prefactored compact schemes are developed that minimise the computational cost for given levels of numerical error in wave propagation phenomena, with special reference to aerodynamic sound. This work extends the approach of Pirozzoli [1] to the MacCormack type prefactored compact high-order schemes developed by Hixon [2], in which their shorter Padé stencil from the prefactorisation leads to a simpler enforcement of numerical boundary conditions. An explicit low-storage multi-step Runge–Kutta integration advances the states in time. Theoretical predictions for spatial and temporal error bounds are derived for the cost-optimised schemes and compared against benchmark schemes of current use in computational aeroacoustic applications in terms of computational cost for a given relative numerical error value. One- and two-dimensional test cases are presented to examine the effectiveness of the cost-optimised schemes for practical flow computations. An effectiveness up to about 50% higher than the standard schemes is verified for the linear one-dimensional advection solver, which is a popular baseline solver kernel for computational physics problems. A substantial error reduction for a given cost is also obtained in the more complex case of a two-dimensional acoustic pulse propagation, provided the optimised schemes are made to operate close to their nominal design points.},

 abstract = {The present research is aimed at understanding the subtle (and not yet fully understood) relationship between the complex nonlinear dynamics of fluid turbulence and Kolmogorov power-law scaling in wavenumber space. Time evolution is often overlooked in DNS of turbulent flows, hence investigation of a suitably simple minimal flow unit (MFU) can help to understand the passage from a vortical-dominated stage to a turbulent stage having all the ingredients of turbulent flows. In particular, we aim at clarifying the physical phenomena associated with the formation of a finite-time singularity (FTS) in the Euler equations and of Kolmogorov’s k−5∕3 scaling in the Navier–Stokes equations. For that purpose, high-resolution simulations of the Euler and Navier–Stokes detection are carried out and analyzed by means of state-of-the-art detection techniques to isolate the contribution of tube-like and sheet-like structures. Equipping the MFU with passive scalars (relevant in turbulent combustion) further helps understanding why passive scalar spectra have a different behavior than the velocity field spectra close to the FTS, but they also attain a k−5∕3 power spectrum at subsequent times, in the presence of finite viscosity. By adding a passive vector (relevant in MHD flows), dynamical differences with respect to the vorticity field can also be established.},

 abstract = {We review numerical methods for direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large-eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent compressible flow in the presence of shock waves. Ideal numerical methods should be accurate and free from numerical dissipation in smooth parts of the flow, and at the same time they must robustly capture shock waves without significant Gibbs ringing, which may lead to nonlinear instability. Adapting to these conflicting goals leads to the design of strongly nonlinear numerical schemes that depend on the geometrical properties of the solution. For low-dissipation methods for smooth flows, numerical stability can be based on physical conservation principles for kinetic energy and/or entropy. Shock-capturing requires the addition of artificial dissipation, in more or less explicit form, as a surrogate for physical viscosity, to obtain nonoscillatory transitions. Methods suitable for both smooth and shocked flows are discussed, and the potential for hybridization is highlighted. Examples of the application of advanced algorithms to DNS/LES of turbulent, compressible flows are presented.},

Across the interaction zone, the r.m.s. wall pressure fluctuations attain large values (in excess of ≈162 dB), with an increase of about 7dB from the upstream level. The main effect of the interaction on the frequency spectra is to enhance of the low-frequency Fourier modes, while inhibiting the high-frequency ones. Excellent collapse of frequency spectra is observed past the interaction zone when data are scaled with the local boundary layer units.

It is found that the transition process is approximately controlled by a Reynolds number based on the momentum deficit past the obstacle, which is proportional to the classical roughness Reynolds number and which approximately incorporates the effects of the roughness element shape. The analysis of the perturbation energy past the obstacle shows that the varicose mode of instability is always dominant in the close proximity of the obstacle, and it promotes transition in supercritical flow cases. On the other hand, the sinuous mode appears to dominate the evolution of marginally subcritical cases, which feature quasi-steady momentum streaks.},

 abstract = {The dynamics of oblique shock wave/turbulent boundary layer interactions is analyzed by mining a large-eddy simulation (LES) database for various strengths of the incoming shock. The flow dynamics is first analyzed by means of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which highlights the simultaneous occurrence of two types of flow modes, namely a low-frequency type associated with breathing motion of the separation bubble, accompanied by flapping motion of the reflected shock, and a high-frequency type associated with the propagation of instability waves past the interaction zone. Global linear stability analysis performed on the mean LES flow fields yields a single unstable zero-frequency mode, plus a variety of marginally stable low-frequency modes whose stability margin decreases with the strength of the interaction. The least stable linear modes are grouped into two classes, one of which bears striking resemblance to the breathing mode recovered from DMD and another class associated with revolving motion within the separation bubble. The results of the modal and linear stability analysis support the notion that low-frequency dynamics is intrinsic to the interaction zone, but some continuous forcing from the upstream boundary layer may be required to keep the system near a limit cycle. This can be modeled as a weakly damped oscillator with forcing, as in the early empirical model by Plotkin (AIAA J 13:1036–1040, 1975).},

 abstract = {We develop a reduced-order model for large-scale unsteadiness (vortex shedding) in a two-dimensional diffuser and use the model to show how periodic mass injection near the separation point reduces stagnation pressure loss. The model estimates the characteristic frequency of vortex shedding and stagnation pressure loss by accounting for the accumulated circulation due to the vorticity flux into the separated region. The stagnation pressure loss consists of two parts: a steady part associated with the time-averaged static pressure distribution on the wall, and an unsteady part caused by vortex shedding. To validate the model, we perform numerical simulations of compressible unsteady laminar diffuser flows in two dimensions. The model and simulation show good agreement as we vary the Mach number and the area ratio of the diffuser. To investigate the effects of periodic mass injection near the separation point, we also perform simulations over a range of the injection frequencies. Periodic mass injection causes vortices to be pinched off with a smaller size as observed in experiments. Consequently, their convective velocity is increased, absorption of circulation from the wall is enhanced, and the reattached point is shifted upstream. Thus, in accordance with the model, the stagnation pressure loss, particularly the unsteady part, is substantially reduced even though the separation point is nearly unchanged. This study helps explain experimental results of separation control using unsteady mass injection in diffusers and on airfoils.},

A Reynolds number is achieved ( , where is the channel half-height, and is the viscous length scale) at which theory predicts the onset of phenomena typical of the asymptotic Reynolds number regime, namely a sensible layer with logarithmic variation of the mean velocity profile, and Kolmogorov scaling of the velocity spectra. Although higher Reynolds numbers can be achieved in experiments, the main advantage of the present DNS study is access to the full three-dimensional flow field. Consistent with refined overlap arguments (Afzal & Yajnik, J. Fluid Mech. vol. 61, 1973, pp. 23–31; Jiménez & Moser, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A, vol. 365, 2007, pp. 715–732), our results suggest that the mean velocity profile never achieves a truly logarithmic profile, and the logarithmic diagnostic function instead exhibits a linear variation in the outer layer whose slope decreases with the Reynolds number. The extrapolated value of the von Kármán constant is . A near logarithmic layer is observed in the spanwise velocity variance, as predicted by Townsend’s attached eddy hypothesis, whereas the streamwise variance seems to exhibit a shoulder, perhaps being still affected by low-Reynolds-number effects. Comparison with previous DNS data at lower Reynolds number suggests enhancement of the imprinting effect of outer-layer eddies onto the near-wall region. This mechanisms is associated with excess turbulence kinetic energy production in the outer layer, and it reflects in flow visualizations and in the streamwise velocity spectra, which exhibit sharp peaks in the outer layer. Associated with the outer energy production site, we find evidence of a Kolmogorov-like inertial range, limited to the spanwise spectral density of , whereas power laws with different exponents are found for the other spectra. Finally, arguments are given to explain the ‘odd’ scaling of the streamwise velocity variances, based on the analysis of the kinetic energy production term.},

                    , which is in accord with Kolmogorov phenomenology. During the short time interval leading to the formation of an inertial range, the total energy dissipation rate shows a clear tendency to become independent of

 abstract = {We study passive scalars in turbulent plane channels at computationally high Reynolds number, thus allowing us to observe previously unnoticed effects. The mean scalar profiles are found to obey a generalized logarithmic law which includes a linear correction term in the whole lower half-channel, and they follow a universal parabolic defect profile in the core region. This is consistent with recent findings regarding the mean velocity profiles in channel flow. The scalar variances also exhibit a near universal parabolic distribution in the core flow and hints of a sizeable log layer, unlike the velocity variances. The energy spectra highlight the formation of large scalar-bearing eddies with size proportional to the channel height which are caused by a local production excess over dissipation, and which are clearly visible in the flow visualizations. Close correspondence of the momentum and scalar eddies is observed, with the main difference being that the latter tend to form sharper gradients, which translates into higher scalar dissipation. Another notable Reynolds number effect is the decreased correlation of the passive scalar field with the vertical velocity field, which is traced to the reduced effectiveness of ejection events.},

                    We investigate the scaling of the energy-containing eddies in the outer part of turbulent wall layers. Their spanwise integral length scales are extracted from a direct numerical simulation (DNS) database, which includes compressible turbulent boundary layers and incompressible turbulent Couette–Poiseuille flows. The results indicate similar behaviour for all classes of flows, with a general increasing trend in the eddy size with the wall distance. A family of scaling relationships are proposed based on simple dimensional arguments, of which the classical mixing length approximation constitutes one example. As in previous studies, we find that the mixing length is in good agreement with the size distribution of the eddies carrying wall-normal velocity, which are active in establishing the mean velocity distribution. However, we find that the eddies associated with wall-parallel motions obey a different scaling, which is controlled by the local mean shear and by an effective eddy diffusivity

                    , and the lift coefficient remains strictly positive. The positive lift provided by the rolling wheel is associated with the presence of a strong (positive) peak of the static pressure in the upstream proximity of the contact point with the ground, which we interpret as the result of the impingement of flow particles entrained in the boundary layer that develops on the front part of the wheel. Steady laminar flow is observed up to
                    
                      ${\mathit{Re}}_{D} \approx 300$

                    , under which conditions the flow retains planar symmetry, and is characterized by the quasi-periodic shedding of hairpin vortices. Transition to three-dimensional flow happens at

                    , in which case a sinuous mode of instability in the wheel wake is established, which modulates the shedding of the hairpins, and which causes the onset of a non-zero side force. At the highest Reynolds number considered here (
                    
                      ${\mathit{Re}}_{D} = 1000$

                    cases. Despite the limitation of the study to low Reynolds numbers we find that, once significant three-dimensionality and scale separation are established in the wheel wake, the nature of the flow becomes qualitatively similar to fully developed turbulent flow. In perspective, this observation opens interesting avenues for the prediction of unsteady flow around rotating tyres at moderate computational cost.

The study highlights the occurrence of streaky patterns of alternating high and low momentum throughout the channel for all flow configurations, except near zeros of the mean shear, where streaks are suppressed. The mean streak spacing shows a relatively universal distribution in the core of the channel, where it ranges from 50 to 100 local viscous units. The validity of the local viscous scaling in collapsing flow features at different wall distances is confirmed by the analysis of the spanwise velocity spectra, which also highlights (in the case of Couette-like flows) the onset of a secondary low-wavenumber flow mode, superposed on the high-wavenumber flow mode that is responsible for the inner-layer dynamics. The effect of the former mode on the latter is studied by means of the two-point amplitude modulation coefficient, which brings to light a nonlinear modulation phenomenon. Physical mechanisms to explain the modulation effect are proposed, based on the interpretation of the conditional average events. Note that, although similar mechanisms have been previously observed in high-Reynolds-number turbulent boundary layers and channels, the modulation effect is here rather associated with the intrinsic large-scale dynamics of Couette-like flows, and takes place at DNS-accessible Reynolds numbers. We thus believe that the study of Couette-like flows may give an alternative avenue for probing inner/outer interaction effects than canonical channel flows.

Upstream of the interaction, in the zero-pressure-gradient region, pressure statistics compare well with canonical low-speed boundary layers in terms of fluctuation intensities, space–time correlations, convection velocities and frequency spectra. Across the interaction zone, the root-mean-square wall pressure fluctuations attain very large values (in excess of 162 dB), with a maximum increase of about 7 dB from the upstream level. The two-point wall pressure correlations become more elongated in the spanwise direction, indicating an increase of the pressure-integral length scales, and the convection velocities (determined from space–time correlations) are reduced. The interaction qualitatively modifies the shape of the frequency spectra, causing enhancement of the low-frequency Fourier modes and inhibition of the higher ones. In the recovery region past the interaction, the pressure spectra collapse very accurately when scaled with either the free-stream dynamic pressure or the maximum Reynolds shear stress, and exhibit distinct power-law regions with exponent −7/3 at intermediate frequencies and −5 at high frequencies. An analysis of the pressure sources in the Lighthill's equation for the instantaneous pressure has been performed to understand their contributions to the wall pressure signature. Upstream of the interaction the sources are mainly located in the proximity of the wall, whereas past the shock, important contributions to low-frequency pressure fluctuations are associated with long-lived eddies developing far from the wall.

The numerical strategy relies on high-order, non-dissipative discretization of the convective terms in the Navier–Stokes equations, and it implements a recycling/rescaling strategy to stimulate the inflow turbulence. Comparison of the velocity statistics up to fourth order shows nearly exact agreement with reference incompressible data, provided the momentum-thickness Reynolds number is matched, and provided the mean velocity and the velocity fluctuations are scaled to incorporate the effects of mean density variation, as postulated by Morkovin’s hypothesis. As also found in the incompressible regime, we observe quite a different behaviour of the second-order flow statistics at sufficiently large Reynolds number, most of which show the onset of a range with logarithmic variation, typical of ‘attached’ variables, whereas the wall-normal velocity exhibits a plateau away from the wall, which is typical of ‘detached’ variables. The modifications of the structure of the flow field that underlie this change of behaviour are highlighted through visualizations of the velocity and temperature fields, which substantiate the formation of large jet-like and wake-like motions in the outer part of the boundary layer. It is found that the typical size of the attached eddies roughly scales with the local mean velocity gradient, rather than being proportional to the wall distance, as happens for the wall-detached variables. The interactions of the large eddies in the outer layer with the near-wall region are quantified through a two-point amplitude modulation covariance, which characterizes the modulating action of energetic outer-layer eddies.

The computational methodology is based on a hybrid linear/weighted essentially non-oscillatory conservative finite-difference approach, whereby the switch is controlled by the local regularity of the solution, so as to minimize numerical dissipation. As found in experiments, the mean flow pattern consists of an upstream fan of compression waves associated with the thickening of the boundary layer, and the supersonic region is terminated by a nearly normal shock, with substantial bending of the interacting shock. At the selected conditions the flow does not exhibit separation in the mean. However, the interaction region is characterized by ‘intermittent transitory detachment’ with scattered spots of instantaneous flow reversal throughout the interaction zone, and by the formation of a turbulent mixing layer, with associated unsteady release of vortical structures. As found in supersonic impinging shock interactions, we observe a different amplification of the longitudinal Reynolds stress component with respect to the others. Indeed, the effect of the adverse pressure gradient is to reduce the mean shear, with subsequent suppression of the near-wall streaks, and isotropization of turbulence. The recovery of the boundary layer past the interaction zone follows a quasi-equilibrium process, characterized by a self-similar distribution of the mean flow properties. },

While a logarithmic mean velocity profile is found to provide a reasonable fit of the data, including the skin friction, closer scrutiny shows that deviations from the log law are systematic, and probably increasing at higher Reynolds numbers. The Reynolds stress distribution shows the formation of a secondary outer peak in the streamwise velocity variance, which is associated with significant excess of turbulent production as compared to the local dissipation. This excess is related to the formation of large-scale streaks and rollers, which are responsible for a substantial fraction of the turbulent shear stress in the channel core, and for significant increase of the turbulence intermittency in the near-wall region.

                    The structure of zero-pressure-gradient compressible turbulent boundary layers is analysed using the tools of optimal transient growth theory. The approach relies on the extension to compressible flows of the theoretical framework originally developed by Reynolds & Hussain (
                    J. Fluid Mech.
                    , vol. 52, 1972, pp. 263–288) for incompressible flows. The model is based on a density-weighted triple decomposition of the instantaneous field into the contributions of the mean flow, the organized (coherent) motions and the disorganized background turbulent fluctuations. The mean field and the eddy viscosity characterizing the incoherent fluctuations are here obtained from a direct numerical simulation database. Most temporally amplified modes (optimal modes) are found to be consistent with scaling laws of turbulent boundary layers for both inner and outer layers, as well as in the logarithmic region, where they exhibit a self-similar spreading. Four free-stream Mach numbers are considered:

                    , 2, 3 and 4. Weak effects of compressibility on the characteristics length and the orientation angles are observed for both the inner- and the outer-layer modes. Furthermore, taking into account the effects of mean density variations, a universal behaviour is suggested for the optimal modes that populate the log layer, regardless of the Mach number. The relevance of the optimal modes in describing the near-wall layer dynamics and the eddies that populate the outer region is discussed.

The study mainly focuses on the early evolution of the mixing region, where transition occurs from a wake-like to a canonical mixing-layer-like behaviour, corresponding to the filling-up of the initial momentum deficit. The mixing layer is found to initially grow faster than linearly, and then at a sub-linear rate further downstream. The Reynolds stress components are in close agreement with reference experiments and follow a continued slow decay till the end of the computational domain. These observations are suggestive of the occurrence of incomplete similarity in the developing turbulent mixing layer. Coherent eddies are found to form in the close proximity of the splitter plate trailing edge, that are mainly organized in bands, initially skewed and then parallel to the spanwise direction. Dynamic mode decomposition is used to educe the dynamically relevant features, and it is found to be capable of singling out the coherent eddies responsible for mixing layer development.},

 abstract = {We present an extensive compilation of direct numerical simulation (DNS) data for Poiseuille and Couette flows, from the laminar into the fully turbulent regime, with the goal of highlighting similarities and differences. The data suggest that, for a given bulk velocity, Couette flow yields less resistance than Poiseuille flow and greater turbulence kinetic energy, which may be beneficial for more efficient diffusion, thus suggesting the effectiveness of fluid transport devices based on moving belts as opposed to classical ducts. Both flows exhibit similar trends for the wall-parallel velocity variances, which increase logarithmically with the Reynolds number. The shear stress and the wall-normal stress tend to saturate faster in Couette flow, which can thus be regarded as a limit to which Poiseuille flow tends, in the limit of high Reynolds number. Excess production over dissipation is found in the outer part of Poiseuille and Couette flow, which is responsible for non-local transfer of energy. However, the structure of the core flow seems to attain an asymptotic state which consists of a parabolic and linear mean velocity profile, respectively, and it seems unlikely that substantial changes to this scenario will occur at Reynolds numbers reachable by DNS in the foreseeable future.},

The study shows structural similarities with the incompressible case. In particular, the inner layer is mainly populated by quasi-streamwise vortices, while in the outer layer we observe a large variety of structures, including hairpin vortices and hairpin packets. The characteristic properties of the educed structures are found to be nearly uniform throughout the outer layer, and to be weakly affected by the local vortex orientation. In the outer layer, typical core radii vary in the range of 5–6 dissipative length scales, and the associated circulation is approximately constant, and of the order of 180 wall units. The statistical properties of the vortical structures in the outer layer are similar to those of an ensemble of non-interacting closed-loop vortices with a nearly planar head inclined at an angle of approximately 20° with respect to the wall, and with an overall size of approximately 30 dissipative length scales.},

                  We reconsider foundations and implications of the mixing length theory as applied to wall-bounded turbulent flows in uniform pressure gradient. Based on recent channel-flow direct numerical simulation (DNS) data at sufficiently high Reynolds number, we find that Prandtl’s hypothesis of linear variation of the mixing length with the wall distance is rather inaccurate, hence overlap arguments are stronger in justifying the formation of a logarithmic layer in the mean velocity profile. Regarding the core region of the wall layer, we find that Clauser’s hypothesis of uniform eddy viscosity is strictly connected with the observed size of the eddy structures, and it delivers surprisingly good agreement with DNS and experiments for channels, pipes, and boundary layers. We show that the analytically derived composite mean velocity profiles can be used to accurately predict skin friction in canonical wall-bounded flows with a minimal number of adjustable parameters directly related to the mean velocity profile, and to obtain some insight into transient growth phenomena.},

It is shown, for the first time, that the cross-statistics of wall-pressure fluctuations at such high Mach numbers is very similar to that usually observed in incompressible flow conditions. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that theoretical predictions provided by the well-known Corcos and Efimtsov models continue to apply.

 abstract = {In the present paper the dynamics of the coupling process of compressible vortex pairs is analyzed by means of extensive numerical simulations. The objective of the study is to determine the effects of the initial vortex spatial structure and of the compressibility. Different vortex structures have been considered and their influence on the vorticity dynamics has been assessed. In the case of free evolution, the numerical simulations show that two vortices in close contact evolve toward a vortex dipole; however, the structure of the resulting dipole depends upon the initial inner core structure and on the vortex intensity. In the presence of shock wave–vortex pair interaction the coupling process depends upon the strength of the shock and the type of pair. In the case of a colliding pair, the process obeys either a two- or a three-stage mechanism depending upon the shock strength, and nonlinear couples form regardless of the initial vortex Mach number. If the interacting shock is strong, the vortex pair experiences a three-stage evolution, whereby the intermediate stage is characterized by the occurrence of a transient nonsymmetric couple. In the case of passing pair, the coupling mechanism proceeds in four stages. In particular, we observe the formation of satellite vortices, whose interaction with the primary vortex during the transient gives rise to the formation of a nonsymmetric dipole and a subsequent temporary tripole due to the feeding of shear produced vorticity. The final stage of the interaction is characterized by the formation of a nonlinear dipole.},

 abstract = {In the present paper the interaction of a planar shock wave with a pair of counter-rotating vortices is studied by means of extensive numerical simulations. The main objective of the study is to characterize the shock pattern and the nature of the acoustic field. For the purpose of shedding some light into the mechanism of sound generation, the acoustic analogy developed by the present authors for the interaction of a shock wave with an isolated vortex has been extended to the case of a vortex pair, so as to obtain a closed form solution for the acoustic far field pressure in the limit of weak vortices. The effect of various parameters, such as the shock and vortex strengths and the initial vortex separation distance has been investigated, and their influence on the dynamics has been assessed. In addition, we have also considered both the case of passing and colliding pairs. In the case of a colliding pair five types of interactions are found to occur, depending upon the value of the interaction parameter, defined as the ratio of the vortex pair intensity over the shock strength. With regard to the acoustic field, the simulations have shown that the latter is the result of two mechanisms: the one directly associated to the interaction itself, and the one related to the coupling process of the vortex pair. The former mechanism is controlling if the interaction is weak, while for strong interactions the acoustic field is also controlled by the sound generated through the coupling process. For all cases the acoustic pressure field exhibits a multipolar directivity pattern with at least four sound peaks along the radial direction; however, if the vortex pair intensity is large the sound waves trailing the precursor are not clearly distinguishable. Shock wave–passing vortex pair interactions exhibit only three types of shock patterns, as in the case of shock wave–isolated vortex interaction; however, the acoustic field exhibits the same features as in the colliding case.},

 abstract = {A spatially developing supersonic adiabatic flat plate boundary layer flow (at M∞=2.25 and Reθ≈4000) is analyzed by means of direct numerical simulation. The numerical algorithm is based on a mixed weighted essentially nonoscillatory compact-difference method for the three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations. The main objectives are to assess the validity of Morkovin’s hypothesis and Reynolds analogies, and to analyze the controlling mechanisms for turbulence production, dissipation, and transport. The results show that the essential dynamics of the investigated turbulent supersonic boundary layer flow closely resembles the incompressible pattern. The Van Driest transformed mean velocity obeys the incompressible law-of-the-wall, and the mean static temperature field exhibits a quadratic dependency upon the mean velocity, as predicted by the Crocco–Busemann relation. The total temperature has been found not to be precisely uniform, and total temperature fluctuations are found to be non-negligible. Consistently, the turbulent Prandtl number is not unity, and it varies between 0.7 and 0.8 in the outer part of the boundary layer. Nonetheless, a modified strong Reynolds analogy is still verified. In agreement with the low Mach number results, the streamwise velocity component and the temperature are only weakly anti-correlated. The turbulent kinetic energy budget also shows similarities with the incompressible case provided all terms of the equation are properly scaled; indeed, the leading compressibility contributions are negligible throughout the boundary layer.},

 abstract = {In the present paper the encounter of vortex rings with planar shock waves is studied in a three-dimensional environment, with the objective to assess the influence of shock and vortex strength and vortex orientation on the dynamics of the process. The study relies on numerical simulations performed by means of a state-of-the-art hybrid compact/WENO (weighted essentially nonoscillatory) shock-capturing algorithm to solve the Euler equations of gas dynamics. The study focuses on the characterization of the interaction in terms of the evolution of the geometrical parameters of the vortex and the mean flow properties such as kinetic energy and enstrophy. The vortex is compressed as it passes through the shock, and its characteristic dimensions decrease; at the same time its axis is deflected and the ring follows a complex dynamic evolution, even though a nearly steady state is reached for the global quantities. In particular, it has been found that the total vortex kinetic energy is generally nonincreasing after the interaction, while the enstrophy always increases. A simple theory is developed here to shed some light onto the physical phenomena involved, which is found to compare reasonably well with the results of the computations. Some final comments are made regarding the extension of the results reported in the present study to the analysis of shock-compressed turbulence.},

The scope of the work is to evaluate the influence of compressibility on the time evolution of mean turbulence properties and to quantify the statistical properties of turbulent structures, their dynamics and similarities with the incompressible case. Simulations have been carried out at various turbulent Mach numbers and compressibility ratios by using a conservative hybrid scheme that relies on an optimized weighted essentially nonoscillatory approach for the convective terms and compact differencing for the viscous contributions. In order to identify similarities with incompressible turbulence we have also carried out an analysis in the plane of the second (Q*) and third (R*) invariants of the anisotropic part of the deformation rate tensor. The simulations show that the joint probability density function (Q*,R*) has a universal structure, as found in incompressible turbulence. The study confirms that the enstrophy obeys a two-stage evolution, due to the competing mechanisms of vortex stretching and viscous dissipation; however, at high turbulent Mach numbers, compressibility effects, associated to the occurrence of shocklets, become important. Furthermore, the analysis of the controlling mechanisms of vorticity generation has shown that even for compressible turbulence the growth of enstrophy is associated to a preferential alignment of the vorticity with the intermediate eigenvector of the anisotropic part of the strain-rate tensor.},

Under the selected flow conditions the incoming boundary layer undergoes mild separation due to the adverse pressure gradient. Coherent structures are shed near the average separation point and the flow field exhibits large-scale low-frequency unsteadiness. The formation of the mixing layer is primarily responsible for the amplification of turbulence, which relaxes to an equilibrium state past the interaction. Complete equilibrium is attained in the inner part of the boundary layer, while in the outer region the relaxation process is incomplete. Far from the interaction zone, turbulence exhibits a universal behavior and it shows similarities with the incompressible case. The interaction of the coherent structures with the incident shock produces acoustic waves that propagate upstream, thus inducing an oscillatory motion of the separation bubble and a subsequent flapping motion of the reflected shock. The simulation indicates the occurrence of low-frequency tones in the interaction zone associated with peaks in the pressure spectra at discrete frequencies. We propose that such large-scale low-frequency unsteadiness is due to a resonance mechanism that establishes in the interaction region, and which has close similarities with those responsible for the generation of tones in cavity flows and screeching jets. In order to support our claim, we develop a simplified model for the acoustic resonance that is capable to predict the characteristic frequencies of the tones.},

This theoretical analysis confirms the existence of an equilibrium structure of the isolated vortex similar to the laminar case.

The results are also compared to theoretical estimates of the production-to-dissipation rate ratio for both types of turbulence models, and to recent experiments on such flows.},

 abstract = {In the present work a theoretical analysis of the asymptotic decay of an isolated, compressible turbulent vortex is presented. The governing equations are expanded in powers of the vortex Mach number squared, and the asymptotic scaling both of the O(1) and the O(M2) variables is theoretically analyzed in the framework of an isotropic eddy viscosity two-equation turbulence model. Numerical simulations are presented to confirm the analytically predicted power-law decay, and to assess the influence of turbulence and of the initial thermodynamic state on the evolution both of a finite- and zero-circulation vortex. Regardless of the initial state, the simulations show that isolated turbulent compressible vortices decay according to a two-stage mechanism. For a finite-circulation vortex, the latter is found to be controlled primarily by the decay of vorticity and heat conduction, while for a zero-circulation vortex, the two-stage mechanism is associated with the reversal of the radial motion within the vortex core.},

 abstract = {In the present paper the interaction of a moving planar shock wave with a cylindrical thermal inhomogeneity is analyzed. Due to the interaction, both vorticity and sound waves are generated. The main focus of the paper is on the generation and propagation of the acoustic waves and their dependence on shock strength and inhomogeneity intensity. An acoustic analogy of the problem has been formulated as a basis of comparison for the structure of the acoustic pressure field in the limit of either weak shocks or weak inhomogeneities. An extensive numerical study has been carried out in order to understand the influence of both shock strength and intensity of the inhomogeneity. The results show that the acoustic field obeys a two-stage evolution that occurs on a time scale that is independent of shock and inhomogeneity intensities. The comparison of the computed far-field pressure with the theoretical result shows that for weak inhomogeneities the sound is well predicted by the acoustic analogy regardless of the shock strength.},

 abstract = {Direct numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the effect of the wall temperature on the behavior of oblique shock wave turbulent boundary layer interactions at free-stream Mach number 2.28 and shock angle of the wedge generator φ=8∘. Five values of the wall-to-recovery-temperature ratio (Tw/Tr) are considered, corresponding to cold, adiabatic, and hot wall thermal conditions. We show that the main effect of cooling is to decrease the characteristic scales of the interaction in terms of upstream influence and extent of the separation bubble. The opposite behavior is observed in the case of heating, which produces a marked dilatation of the interaction region. The distribution of the Stanton number shows that a strong amplification of the heat transfer occurs across the interaction, with the maximum thermal and dynamic loads found for the case of the cold wall. The analysis reveals that the fluctuating heat flux exhibits a strong intermittent behavior, characterized by scattered spots with extremely high values compared to the mean. Furthermore, the analogy between momentum and heat transfer, typical of compressible, wall-bounded, equilibrium turbulent flows, does not apply for most of the interaction domain. The premultiplied spectra of the wall heat flux do not show any evidence of the influence of the low-frequency shock motion, and the primary mechanism for the generation of peak heating is found to be linked with the turbulence amplification in the interaction region.},

The combined effect of forced and free convection produces a peculiar pattern of quasi-streamwise rollers occupying the full channel thickness, with aspect ratio considerably higher than unity; it has been observed that they have an important redistributing effect on temperature and momentum, providing for a substantial fraction of the heat and momentum flux at bulk Richardson numbers larger than

In particular, the widely used Businger–Dyer flux-profile relationships are found to provide a convenient way of approximately accounting for the bulk effects of friction and buoyancy, although the individual profiles may have wide scatter from the alleged trends. Significant deviations are found in direct numerical simulations with respect to the commonly used parametrization of the momentum flux in the light-wind regime, which may have important practical impact in wall models of atmospheric dynamics.

 abstract = {We study turbulent plane Couette-Poiseuille (CP) flows in which the conditions (relative wall velocity ΔUw ≡ 2Uw, pressure gradient dP/dx and viscosity ν) are adjusted to produce zero mean skin friction on one of the walls, denoted by APG for adverse pressure gradient. The other wall, FPG for favorable pressure gradient, provides the friction velocity uτ, and h is the half-height of the channel. This leads to a one-parameter family of one-dimensional flows of varying Reynolds number Re ≡ Uwh/ν. We apply three codes, and cover three Reynolds numbers stepping by a factor of two each time. The agreement between codes is very good, and the Reynolds-number range is sizable. The theoretical questions revolve around Reynolds-number independence in both the core region (free of local viscous effects) and the two wall regions. The core region follows Townsend’s hypothesis of universal behavior for the velocity and shear stress, when they are normalized with uτ and h; on the other hand universality is not observed for all the Reynolds stresses, any more than it is in Poiseuille flow or boundary layers. The FPG wall region obeys the classical law of the wall, again for velocity and shear stress. For the APG wall region, Stratford conjectured universal behavior when normalized with the pressure gradient, leading to a square-root law for the velocity. The literature, also covering other flows with zero skin friction, is ambiguous. Our results are very consistent with both of Stratford’s conjectures, suggesting that at least in this idealized flow turbulence theory is successful like it was for the classical logarithmic law of the wall. We appear to know the constants of the law within a 10% bracket. On the other hand, that again does not extend to Reynolds stresses other than the shear stress, but these stresses are passive in the momentum equation.},

 abstract = {Multi-scale analysis of the mean equation for passive scalar transport is used to investigate the asymptotic scaling structure of fully developed turbulent channel flow subjected to uniform heat generation. Unlike previous studies of channel flow heat transport with fixed surface temperature or constant inward surface flux, the present flow has a constant outward wall flux that accommodates for the volumetrically uniform heat generation. This configuration has distinct analytical advantages relative to precisely elucidating the underlying self-similar structure admitted by the mean transport equation. The present analyses are advanced using direct numerical simulations (Pirozzoli et al., 2016) that cover friction Reynolds numbers up to δ+=4088 and Prandtl numbers ranging from Pr=0.2–1.0. The leading balances of terms in the mean equation are determined empirically and then analytically described. Consistent with its asymptotic universality, the logarithmic mean temperature profile is shown analytically to arise as a similarity solution to the mean scalar equation, with this solution emerging (as δ+→∞) on an interior domain where molecular diffusion effects are negligible. In addition to clarifying the Reynolds and Prandtl number influences on the von Kármán constant for temperature, kθ, the present theory also provides a couple of self-consistent ways to estimate, kθ. As with previous empirical observations, the present analytical predictions for kθ indicate values that are larger than found for the mean velocity von Kármán constant. The potential origin of this is briefly discussed.},

As a consequence, we find that parametrizations based on the hydraulic diameter concept, and modifications thereof, are successful in predicting the duct friction coefficient.

Numerical experiments have also been carried out whereby the secondary motions are suppressed, hence allowing to quantifying their effect on the mean flow field. At sufficiently high Reynolds number, secondary motions are found to increase the friction coefficient by about 3%, hence proportionally to their relative strength with respect to the bulk flow.

                    Design/methodology/approach
                    Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations and detached-eddy simulations provide a preliminary buffet map, while a high fidelity implicit large-eddy simulation with an upstream laminar boundary layer is used to ascertain the physical feasibility of the various buffet mechanisms. Numerical experiments with unsteady RANS highlight the role of waves travelling on pressure side in the buffet mechanism. Estimates of the propagation velocities of coherent disturbances and of acoustic waves are obtained, to check the validity of popular mechanisms based on acoustic feedback from the trailing edge.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    Unsteady RANS numerical experiments demonstrate that the pressure side of the airfoil plays a marginal role in the buffet mechanism. Implicit LES data show that the only plausible self-sustaining mechanism involves waves scattered from the trailing edge and penetrating the sonic region from above the suction side shock. An interesting side result of this study is that buffet appears to be more intense in the case that the boundary layer state upstream of the shock is turbulent, rather than laminar.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    The results of the study will be of interest to any researcher involved with transonic buffet.

To perform the simulations the Navier-Stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates are discretized by a second-order finite difference scheme, and the immersed-boundary technique is used to resolve the flow close to walls of complex shape. The basic geometry is a circular pipe of radius R, with imposed sinusoidal perturbations of the type ηRsin(Nw𝜃)$$\eta R \sin (N_{w}\theta )$$. Simulations by varying Nw at fixed η were performed to investigate the effect of the perturbation wavenumber. Additional simulations by fixing Nw and varying η also allow to investigate the influence of the amplitude of the wall corrugations. The modifications of the near-wall structures due to change in the shape of the walls are well depicted through contour plots of the radial component of the vorticity. The presence of geometrical disturbances anchors the structures at the locations where curvature changes, and the shape of the structures is strongly linked to the amplitude of the wall corrugation. Our interest is also in understanding the influence of the shape of the surface on wall friction. We were expecting some changes in the profile of the total stress with respect to that of the circular pipe, which instead were not found. This is a first indication that changes in the near-wall region do not affect the outer region, and that Townsend’s similarity hypothesis holds.},

@article{pub.1107478929,
 abstract = {We introduce a standardized procedure for benchmarking shock-capturing schemes which is intended to go beyond traditional case-by-case analysis, by setting objective metrics for cross-comparison of flow solvers. The main idea is that use of shock-capturing schemes yields both distributed errors associated with propagation of wave-like disturbances in smooth flow regions, and localized errors at shocks where nonlinear numerical mechanisms are most active. Our standardized error evaluation framework relies on previous methods of analysis for the propagation error with associated cost/error mapping, and on novel analysis of the shock-capturing error based on a model scalar problem. Amplitude and phase errors are identified for a number of classical shock-capturing schemes with different order of accuracy. Whereas all schemes are found to be, as expected, first-order accurate at shocks, quantitative differences are found to be significant, and we find that certain schemes in wide use (e.g. high-order WENO schemes) may yield substantial over-amplification of incoming disturbances at shocks. Illustrative calculations are also shown for the 1D Euler equations, which support sufficient generality of the analysis, although nonlinearity suggests caution in straightforward extrapolation to other flow cases.},

 abstract = { We study compressible turbulent flow in a circular pipe at computationally high Reynolds number. Classical related issues are addressed and discussed in light of the DNS data, including validity of compressibility transformations, velocity/temperature relations, passive scalar statistics, and size of turbulent eddies. Regarding velocity statistics, we find that Huang’s transformation yields excellent universality of the scaled Reynolds stresses distributions, whereas the transformation proposed by Trettel and Larsson (2016) yields better representation of the effects of strong variation of density and viscosity occurring in the buffer layer on the mean velocity distribution. A clear logarithmic layer is recovered in terms of transformed velocity and wall distance coordinates at the higher Reynolds number under scrutiny (Reτ  ≈ 1000), whereas the core part of the flow is found to be characterized by a universal parabolic velocity profile. Based on formal similarity between the streamwise velocity and the passive scalar transport equations, we further propose an extension of the above compressibility transformations to also achieve universality of passive scalar statistics. Analysis of the velocity/temperature relationship provides evidence for quadratic dependence which is very well approximated by the thermal analogy proposed by Zhang et al. (2014). The azimuthal velocity and scalar spectra show an organization very similar to canonical incompressible flow, with a bump-shaped distribution across the flow scales, whose peak increases with the wall distance. We find that the size growth effect is well accounted for through an effective length scale accounting for the local friction velocity and for the local mean shear.},

The effects of flow compressibility on the secondary motions are found to be negligible, with the typical Mach number associated with the cross-stream flow always less than 0.1. As in the incompressible case, we find that the wall law for the mean streamwise velocity applies with good approximation with respect to the nearest wall, upon suitable compressibility transformation. The same conclusion also applies to a passive scalar field, whereas the mean temperature does not exhibit inertial layers because of nonuniformity of the aerodynamic heating. We further find that the same temperature/velocity relation that holds for planar channels is applicable with good approximation for square ducts, and develop a similar relation between temperature and passive scalars.},

 abstract = {The asymptotic scaling structure of the total scalar variance equation is investigated for fully developed turbulent channel flow subjected to uniform scalar generation. The total scalar variance balance has a four-layer structure similar to that of the total kinetic energy balance, as previously investigated by Zhou and Klewicki [Phys. Rev. Fluids 1, 044408 (2016)2469-990X10.1103/PhysRevFluids.1.044408]. Direct numerical simulation data are used to quantify the leading balance structure. These data cover the friction Reynolds number up to δ+=4088 and Prandtl number ranging between Pr=0.2 and 1.0. Of the layers empirically characterized, the inner-normalized width of the third layer is analytically verified to be δ+−δ+/Pr. This result agrees closely with the empirical observations. Consistent with previous observations, the Kármán constant, kθ, for the mean scalar profile for Pr=1 is shown to be greater than the Kármán constant, k, for the mean velocity profile. Unlike previous studies, the present problem formation yields identical mean equations and boundary conditions for the scalar and velocity, and this allows unambiguous comparisons regarding the noted differences between k and kθ. Results from the mean transport equations and streamwise velocity and scalar variance budget equations, as well as the relevant correlation coefficient profiles, are used to clarify the source of the differences between k and kθ. Through the present theory, the results reported herein connect the statistical structure of the scalar and velocity fields to the mean profile slopes.},

ducts with several aspect ratios. The Navier-Stokes equations are discretized
through a second-order finite difference scheme, with non-uniform grids in two
directions. The duct cross-sectional area is maintained constant as well as the
flow rate, which allows to investigate which is the appropriate length scale in
the Reynolds number for a good scaling in the laminar and in the fully
turbulent regimes. We find that the Reynolds number based on the half length of
the short side leads to a critical Reynolds number which is independent on the
aspect ratio (AR), for ducts with AR>1. The mean and rms wall-normal velocity
profiles are found to scale with the local value of the friction velocity. At
high friction Reynolds numbers, the Reynolds number dependence is similar to
that in turbulent plane channels, hence flows in rectangular ducts allow to
investigate the Reynolds number dependency through a reduced number of
simulations. At low Re the profiles of the statistics differ from those in the
two-dimensional channel due to the interaction of flow structures of different
size. The projection of the velocity vector and of the Reynolds stress tensor
along the eigenvectors of the strain-rate tensor yields reduced Reynolds stress
anisotropy, and simple turbulent kinetic energy budgets.},

convection produces a peculiar pattern of quasi--streamwise rollers occupying
the full channel thickness with aspect--ratio considerably higher than unity;
it has been observed that they have an important redistributing effect on
temperature and momentum. The mean values and the variances of the flow
variables do not appear to follow Prandtl's scaling in the flow regime near
free convection, except for the temperature and vertical velocity fluctuations,

Monin--Obukhov theory still yields a useful representation of the main flow
features. In particular, the widely used Businger--Dyer relationships provide a
convenient way of accounting for the bulk effects of shear and buoyancy,
although individual profiles may vary widely from the alleged trends.
Significant deviations are found in DNS with respect to the commonly used
parametrization of the mean velocity in the light-wind regime, which may have
important practical impact in models of atmospheric dynamics. Finally, for
modelling purposes, we devise a set of empirical predictive formulas for the

of cooling is to decrease the characteristic scales of the interaction in terms
of upstream influence and extent of the separation bubble. The opposite
behavior is observed in the case of heating, that produces a marked dilatation
of the interaction region. The distribution of the Stanton number shows that a
strong amplification of the heat transfer occurs across the interaction, and
the maximum values of thermal and dynamic loads are found in the case of cold
wall. The analysis reveals that the fluctuating heat flux exhibits a strong
intermittent behavior, characterized by scattered spots with extremely high
values compared to the mean. Furthermore, the analogy between momentum and heat
transfer, typical of compressible, wall-bounded, equilibrium turbulent flows
does not apply for most part of the interaction domain. The pre-multiplied
spectra of the wall heat flux do not show any evidence of the influence of the

high Reynolds number. Classical related issues are addressed and discussed in
light of the DNS data, including validity of compressibility transformations,
velocity/temperature relations, passive scalar statistics, and size of
turbulent eddies.Regarding velocity statistics, we find that Huang's
transformation yields excellent universality of the scaled Reynolds stresses
distributions, whereas the transformation proposed by Trettel and Larsson
(2016) yields better representation of the effects of strong variation of
density and viscosity occurring in the buffer layer on the mean velocity
distribution. A clear logarithmic layer is recovered in terms of transformed
velocity and wall distance coordinates at the higher Reynolds number under
scrutiny ($\Rey_{\tau} \approx 1000$), whereas the core part of the flow is
found to be characterized by a universal parabolic velocity profile. Based on
formal similarity between the streamwise velocity and the passive scalar
transport equations, we further propose an extension of the above
compressibility transformations to also achieve universality of passive scalar
statistics. Analysis of the velocity/temperature relationship provides evidence
for quadratic dependence which is very well approximated by the thermal analogy
proposed by Zhang et Al.(2014). The azimuthal velocity and scalar spectra show
an organization very similar to canonical incompressible flow, with a
bump-shaped distribution across the flow scales, whose peak increases with the
wall distance. We find that the size growth effect is well accounted for
through an effective length scale accounting for the local friction velocity
and for the local mean shear.},

In this paper, we decompose the mean friction drag in incompressible (250 ≤ Reτ ≤ 1270) and compressible (M = 2.0 and 250 ≤ Reτ ≤ 1110) zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) into three physics-informed contributions, by using the identity of Renard and Deck [“A theoretical decomposition of mean skin friction generation into physical phenomena across the boundary layer,” J. Fluid Mech. 790, 339–367 (2016)] and its compressible-flow extension [Li et al., “Decomposition of the mean skin-friction drag in compressible turbulent channel flows,” J. Fluid Mech. 875, 101–123 (2019)], respectively. The Reynolds number effects and scaling of each contributing term are investigated. Proportionality of the viscous and logarithmic increase with Reτ of the turbulent one when scaled by Cf3/2 are found, with different scaling coefficients in incompressible and compressible TBLs, owing to variation in the thermodynamic properties in the compressible cases. On use of compressibility transformations to account for variation in the thermodynamic properties in the wall-normal direction, the terms contributing to friction in compressible TBLs are found to reduce to those in the incompressible limit, with good accuracy. At M = 2.0, deviations from universality are mainly confined to the near-wall region, say y+ < 30, and account for approximately 16% of the generated friction.},

In the present paper we attempt to answer the basic question of how small these effects are, by interrogating a DNS database of compressible channel flow and by using Helmholtz decomposition to infer the relative magnitude and correlations between the solenoidal and the dilatational parts of turbulence velocity fields. Not surprisingly, we find dilatational velocity fluctuations to be much smaller than solenoidal ones, but perhaps unexpectedly, we find that finite correlation between the two components accounts for a nonnegligible fraction (about 10%) of the turbulent shear stress near walls, and for up to 4% of the wall skin friction. Quadrant analysis of the dilatational velocity fluctuations shows that the largest contribution to the turbulent shear stress results from significant correlation between positive streamwise solenoidal velocity fluctuations (i.e., high-speed streaks), and positive vertical dilatational velocity fluctuations, which tend to mitigate the intensity of wall-ward sweep events.},

 Much of our theoretical understanding of statistically stable and unstable flows is from the classical Monin–Obukhov similarity theory: the theory predicts the scaling of the mean flow well, but its prediction of the turbulent fluctuation is far from satisfactory. This study builds on Monin–Obukhov similarity theory and Townsend’s attached-eddy hypothesis. We present a model that connects the mean flow and the streamwise velocity fluctuations in both neutral and unstable boundary-layer flows at both moderate and high Reynolds numbers. The model predictions are compared to direct numerical simulations of weakly unstable boundary layers at moderate Reynolds numbers, and large-eddy simulations of unstable boundary-layer flows at high Reynolds numbers. The flow is shear dominated. The range of stability parameter considered in this work is    $L/\unicode[STIX]{x1D6FF}<-0.1$   , where    $L$   is the Monin–Obukhov length, and    $\unicode[STIX]{x1D6FF}$   is the boundary-layer height. Reasonably good prediction of velocity fluctuations based on knowledge of the mean velocity profile is obtained. },

 abstract = {We present a systematic framework for the evaluation of shock sensors in high-resolution hybrid compact/WENO algorithms, with the goals of testing robustness and establishing accuracy in wavenumber space, with the intent to go beyond mere case-by-case comparison of solvers/sensors. Several sensors are considered, including classical ones, sensors based on multi-resolution wavelet analysis, and WENO-based shock sensors. The crucial issue of identification of suitable thresholds for the various shock sensors is tackled through a series of static tests and numerical simulations. Whereas any shock sensor with suitably low threshold is found to be effective in capturing shocks, not all of them perform equally well for waves. Performance degradation in numerical simulation of wave-like phenomena is here characterized by introducing an effective band-width for each sensor, which is found to be quite narrow for classical sensors, and much wider for WENO-based shock sensors. Based on this analysis, we also identify a new shock sensor which can be easily implemented in existing WENO-based codes. The new sensor doesn’t suffer from contamination from the WENO numerical error even for waves resolved with as few as three points-per-wavelength. This property translates into improved performance in wavenumber space, and greater resolving power in flow cases involving shocks and compressible turbulence, as demonstrated through a series of numerical tests. We emphasize that this sensor can be applied more broadly to any algorithm which contains similar smoothness indicators as classical WENO.},

specifically designed to cope with the challenging problems associated with the

As flow control devices were used here in the laminar boundary layer for the first time, their effectiveness in transition induction was an important outcome. It was intended to determine in what way the application of these techniques induces transition. These methods should have a significantly different effect on boundary layer receptivity, i.e. the transition location. Apart from an improved understanding of operation control methods, the main objective was to localize the transition as far downstream as possible while ensuring a turbulent character of interaction. The final objective, involving all the partners, was to build a physical model of transition control devices. Establishing of such model would simplify the numerical approach to flow cases using such devices.

 abstract = {Study of transition location effect (from natural transition to fully turbulent) on separation size, shock structure and unsteadiness was the focus of this WP. Boundary layer tripping (by wire or roughness) and flow control devices (VG) were used for boundary layer transition induction. Although this type of flow field had been studied widely in the past, there remains considerable uncertainty on the effects of transition on transonic aerofoil performance. In particular it is not known how close to the shock location transition has to occur to avoid detrimental effects associated with laminar shock-induced separation. Furthermore, it was unclear how best to provoke transition on an airfoil featuring significant laminar flow and how close to the shock this needs to be performed. Finally, current CFD methods are particularly challenged by such transitional flows. In this work package some of the findings from the basic research performed in other WPs was applied. Specialized large-scale transonic wind tunnels running cost is very high therefore using such facilities is not appropriate for upstream research programs such as TFAST. Therefore we have used existing wind tunnels within our consortium. One of these is a transonic test section at UCAM where laminar and transitional profiles were studied previously at Reynolds numbers up to 2 million (based on chord length). This wind tunnel allowed basic investigations of the transition location effects on a shock induced separation and unsteadiness for a relatively large number of parameters. A larger wind tunnel at Institute of Aviation in Warsaw was used, which enabled the investigation of a much larger aspect ratio profile. In this facility it was possible to measure a whole force polar up to and including the buffet boundary.

 abstract = {In order to be able to judge the effectiveness of transition induction in WP-2, reference flow cases were planned in WP-1. There are two obvious reference cases—a fully laminar interaction and a fully turbulent interaction. Here it should be explained that the terms “laminar” and “turbulent” interaction refer to the boundary layer state at the beginning of interaction only. There are two basic configurations of shock wave boundary layer interaction and these are a part of the TFAST project. One is the normal shock wave, which typically appears at the transonic wing and on the turbine cascade. The characteristic incipient separation Mach number range is about M = 1.2 in the case of a laminar boundary layer and about M = 1.32 in the case of turbulent boundary layer. The second typical flow case is the oblique shock wave reflection. The most characteristic case in European research is connected to the 6th FP IP HISAC project concerning a supersonic business jet. The design speed of this airplane is M = 1.6. Therefore the TFAST consortium decided to use this Mach number as the basic case. Pressure disturbance at this Mach number is not very high and can be compared to the disturbance of the normal shock at the incipient separation Mach number mentioned earlier. As mentioned earlier, shock reflection at M = 1.6 may be related to incipient separation. Therefore two additional test cases were planned with different Mach numbers. ITAM conducted an M = 1.5 test case, and TUD an M = 1.7 test case. These partners have also previously made very specialized and successful contributions to the UFAST project.},

 abstract = {Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of flow over triangular and rectangular riblets in a wide range of size and Reynolds number have been carried out. The flow within the grooves is directly resolved by exploiting the immersed-boundary method. It is found that the drag reduction property is primarily associated with the capability of inhibiting vertical velocity fluctuations at the plane of the crests, as in liquid-infused surfaces (LIS) devices. This is mimicked in DNS through artificial suppression of the vertical velocity component, which yields large drag decrease, proportionate to the riblets size. A parametrization of the drag reduction effect in terms of the vertical velocity variance is found to be quite successful in accounting for variation of the controlling parameters. A Moody-like friction diagram is thus introduced which incorporates the effect of slip velocity and a single, geometry-dependent parameter. Reduced drag-reduction efficiency of LIS-like riblets is found as compared to cases with artificially imposed slip velocity. Last, we find that simple wall models of riblets and LIS-like devices are unlikely to provide accurate prediction of the flow phenomenon, and direct resolution of flow within the grooves in necessary.},

 abstract = {The generation of friction drag in turbulent duct flows has direct connection with statistical quantities and corresponding turbulence dynamics in the duct cross-section. In this study, we generalize the RD identity (Renard and Deck, 2016) to a ‘two-dimensional’ form which we exploit to decompose the mean friction drag in turbulent square-duct flows into contributions associated with viscosity, turbulence and cross-stream convection. The friction Reynolds number of the duct flows ranges from 220 to 2000. The scaling, spatial distribution and local normalization of the contributions to friction are investigated and compared with those in pipe and channel flows. As in other canonical flows, we find logarithmic growth of the turbulent contribution in contrast to the viscous one, the former thus becoming dominant at high enough Reynolds numbers. Whereas cross-stream convection has no net effect on friction, its contribution may be locally comparable to the other two, hence may be responsible for redistribution of friction along the duct perimeter.},

 abstract = {We study compressibility effects on pressure fluctuations in wall-bounded turbulent flows using DNS data of compressible turbulent channel flows at various Mach numbers. We derive a pressure Poisson equation that allows splitting pressure fluctuations into the following terms: the rapid and slow terms as in incompressible flows, an additional mass-flux term related to the temporal and spatial variation of mass-flux fluctuations, and a viscous term related to fluctuating viscous stresses. As the bulk Mach number increases, the intensity of pressure fluctuations increases in the viscous sublayer and in the outer region, resulting from the intensification of the mass-flux term, whereas it decreases in the buffer layer and logarithmic layers, after weakening of the slow term. The rapid and slow terms are further split into their solenoidal and dilatational components using Helmholtz decomposition. The variances of the solenoidal components are found to be independent of the Mach number, whereas the dilatational components increase quadratically with the Mach number. The correlations between split pressure fluctuations and dilatational fluctuations show that the solenoidal-related pressure field turns turbulent kinetic energy into internal energy, whereas dilatational and viscous terms are responsible for reverse energy transfer.},

 abstract = {We present an updated version of the open-source Hypersonics Task-based Research (HTR) solver for hypersonic aerothermodynamics. The solver, whose first version was presented in Di Renzo et al. (2020), is designed for direct numerical simulation (DNS) of canonical hypersonic flows at high Reynolds numbers in which thermo-chemical effects induced by high temperatures are relevant. The solver relies on high-order spatial discretization on structured meshes and efficient time integrators for stiff systems within the Regent/Legion software stack, which makes the code highly portable and scalable in CPU and GPU-based supercomputers. The new version herein presented includes several optimizations and new tools for data analysis, along with novel user option for hybrid skew-symmetric/targeted essentially non-oscillatory numerics, to offer higher computational efficiency and lower numerical dissipation at moderate Mach numbers, inclusion of a new combustion mechanism for methane and oxygen, and new recycling–rescaling inlet boundary conditions targeted to the simulation of fully developed turbulent boundary layers. New version program Program Title: Hypersonics Task-based Research solver CPC Library link to program files: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/9zsxjtzfr7.2 Developer’s repository link: https://github.com/stanfordhpccenter/HTR-solver.git Licensing provisions: BSD 2-clause Programming language: Regent, C++, and CUDA Journal Reference of previous version: Di Renzo, M., Fu, L., & Urzay, J. (2020). HTR solver: An open-source exascale-oriented task-based multi-GPU high-order code for hypersonic aerothermodynamics. Computer Physics Communications, 107262. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Reasons for the new version: Release of new features Summary of revisions: • New optional sixth-order hybrid scheme has been implemented (activated by the flag “hybridScheme” in the input file). The scheme combines the energy-preserving properties of a sixth-order skew-symmetric central difference scheme [1] in smooth flow regions with the shock-capturing properties of a sixth-order targeted essentially non-oscillatory (TENO) scheme at points where shocks are involved. The switch between the two schemes is controlled by a TENO sensor whose cutoff value is adapted based on the maximum value of a modified Ducros sensor [2] across the reconstruction stencil. If the flag “hybridScheme” is set to false, the numerical scheme will revert to the TENO6-A scheme released in the previous version of the solver [3]; • New recycling–rescaling inflow boundary conditions [4,5] for the simulation of turbulent compressible boundary layers are now available to the user; • Support for Legion tracing, which significantly improves the strong scalability of the solver, has been implemented; • A diagnostic tool to monitor the time evolution of the flow variables in a subvolume of the computational domain is now available; • A single-step chemistry mechanism for methane/oxygen combustion has been added to the mixtures handled by the HTR solver; • Sample scripts for strong scaling have been added to the “testcases” directory; • Unit test and regression test suites have been added to the repository; • The input file scheme has been modified in order to reduce verbosity and increase flexibility in specifying the boundary conditions and type of gas mixture; • Hyperbolic sine stretching functions have been made available to users during the grid generation process; • Computationally intensive tasks have been ported to C++ and CUDA in order to achieve higher efficiency on all hardware; • Several optimizations of the tasks body and mapper have been implemented in order to increase the computational efficiency and reduce the memory footprint. Nature of problem: This code solves the Navier–Stokes equations at hypersonic Mach numbers including finite-rate chemistry for dissociating air and multicomponent transport. The solver is designed for direct numerical simulations (DNS) of transitional and turbulent hypersonic turbulent flows under high-enthalpy conditions, and it accounts for thermochemical effects (vibrational excitation and chemical dissociation). Solution method: This code uses a low-dissipation sixth-order schemes for the spatial discretization of the conservation equations on Cartesian stretched meshes. Time advancement is carried out by either an explicit method if chemistry is slow, hence not introducing additional stiffness, or by an operator-splitting algorithm whereby chemical production rates are handled implicitly. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: The HTR solver builds on the runtime Legion [6,7] and is written in the programming language Regent [8,9] developed at Stanford University. Instructions for installation of the components are provided in the README file enclosed with the HTR solver and in the Legion repository [6]. References [1] S.

 abstract = {We carry out a parametric study of conical shock-wave/turbulent boundary-layer interactions by means of numerical simulation of the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations, with the eventual goal of establishing the predictive capabilities of standard turbulence models. Preliminary assessment of several linear-eddy-viscosity models for the case of planar interactions shows that the k−ε model and its variants as well as the Spalart–Allmaras model yield accurate prediction of the typical interaction length scale. Numerical simulations of conical interactions at high Reynolds numbers under attached and separated flow conditions generally support good capability of RANS to predict the gross flow features, including conditions of incipiently and fully separated flow. Comparison with direct numerical simulation data at low Reynolds numbers suggests that caution should be made because certain turbulence models may yield unrealistic incoming velocity profiles. With this caveat, we again find that RANS models yield satisfactory prediction of the three-dimensional flow organization and associated length scales. The N-wave mean wall pressure signature is quantitatively predicted, and accurate information about the fluctuating pressure variance can be obtained from RANS data in a postprocessing stage by extension of correlations developed for low-speed separation bubbles.},

 Numerical simulations are used to probe Rayleigh–Darcy convection in fluid-saturated porous media towards the ultimate regime. The present three-dimensional dataset, up to Rayleigh–Darcy number    $\textit {Ra}=8\times 10^4$   , suggests that the appropriate scaling of the Nusselt number is    $\textit {Nu}=0.0081\textit {Ra}+0.067\textit {Ra}^{0.61}$   , fitting the computed data for    $\textit {Ra}\gtrsim 10^3$   . Extrapolation of current predictions to the ultimate linear regime yields the asymptotic law    $\textit {Nu}=0.0081 \textit {Ra}$   , about    $16\,\%$   less than indicated in previous studies. Upon examination of the flow structures near the boundaries, we confirm previous indications of small flow cells hierarchically nesting into supercells, and we show evidence that the supercells at the boundary are the footprints of the megaplumes that dominate the interior part of the flow. The present findings pave the way for more accurate modelling of geophysical systems, with special reference to geological    $\textrm {CO}_2$   sequestration. },

 abstract = {We present STREAmS, an in-house high-fidelity solver for direct numerical simulations (DNS) of canonical compressible wall-bounded flows, namely turbulent plane channel, zero-pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer and supersonic oblique shock-wave/boundary layer interaction. The solver incorporates state-of-the-art numerical algorithms, specifically designed to cope with the challenging problems associated with the solution of high-speed turbulent flows and can be used across a wide range of Mach numbers, extending from the low subsonic up to the hypersonic regime. From the computational viewpoint, STREAmS is oriented to modern HPC platforms thanks to MPI parallelization and the ability to run on multi-GPU architectures. This paper discusses the main implementation strategies, with particular reference to the CUDA paradigm, the management of a single code for traditional and multi-GPU architectures, and the optimization process to take advantage of the latest generation of NVIDIA GPUs. Performance measurements show that single-GPU optimization more than halves the computing time as compared to the baseline version. At the same time, the asynchronous patterns implemented in STREAmS for MPI communications guarantee very good parallel performance especially in the weak scaling spirit, with efficiency exceeding 97% on 1024 GPUs. For overall evaluation of STREAmS with respect to other compressible solvers, comparison with a recent GPU-enabled community solver is presented. It turns out that, although STREAmS is much more limited in terms of flow configurations that can be addressed, the advantage in terms of accuracy, computing time and memory occupation is substantial, which makes it an ideal candidate for large-scale simulations of high-Reynolds number, compressible wall-bounded turbulent flows. The solver is released open source under GPLv3 license.

Shock-capturing capabilities rely on the use of Lax–Friedrichs flux vector splitting and weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) reconstruction.

Prandtl friction law, amounting to about $2\%$, which would extrapolate to
about $4\%$ at extreme Reynolds numbers. Data fitting of the DNS friction
coefficient yields an estimated von Kármán constant $k \approx 0.387$,
which nicely fits the mean velocity profile, and which supports universality of
canonical wall-bounded flows. The same constant also applies to the pipe
centerline velocity, thus providing support for the claim that the asymptotic
state of pipe flow at extreme Reynolds numbers should be plug flow. At the
Reynolds numbers under scrutiny, no evidence for saturation of the logarithmic
growth of the inner peak of the axial velocity variance is found. Although no
outer peak of the velocity variance directly emerges in our DNS, we provide
strong evidence that it should appear at $Re_{\tau} \gtrsim 10^4$, as a result
of turbulence production exceeding dissipation over a large part of the outer

We then carry out a parametric study by changing the corner angle in the range θ=45°–135°, focusing on the effect on the mean streamwise and secondary flow. The maximum strength of the secondary flows of about 0.015u∞ occurs for θ=90°, which is similar to what is found in fully developed square ducts. Secondary eddies have approximately unit aspect ratio, and they maintain their shape for different corner angles by translating in the direction parallel to the closest wall. As a result, the position of the vortex center can be described by a simple geometrical transformation of the wall-parallel coordinate. We find that small corner angles are responsible for locally relaminarization flow at the corner, but otherwise the mean streamwise velocity profiles transformed according to van Driest following the canonical law-of-the-wall.},

This effect is traced to retarded growth of the shear layer surrounding the separation bubble, with associated reduction of the turbulent shear stress. Genuinely, three-dimensional effects are observed in the interaction and in the downstream recovery zone, with mean flow direction changing both in the longitudinal and wall-normal directions. Three-dimensional, non-equilibrium effects yield substantial misalignment between turbulent stresses and mean strain rate, thus providing a challenging benchmark for the development and validation of turbulence models for compressible flows.},

Comparison is made with the reference solutions of the same problem obtained with a direct numerical simulation (DNS) approach, which allows to describe the full features of flow and heat evolution in the channel. Numerical simulations are carried out for different values of the fluid-solid thermal conductivity ratio to bring out conjugate heat transfer effects. Finite conductivity of the solid is found to imply reduced thermal efficiency of the overall system as a result of both increased thermal resistance, and asymmetric heat loading on the fluid. We find that, despite the absence of the secondary motions, the RANS/Fourier solver can accurately estimate the pressure drop. Differences in the prediction of thermal effects are generally larger. However, the wall temperature distributions are predicted by RANS with reasonable accuracy, and discrepancy in the overall heat transfer coefficient is no larger than 10 % .},

The same constant also applies to the pipe centreline velocity, thus providing support for the claim that the asymptotic state of pipe flow at extreme Reynolds numbers should be plug flow. At the Reynolds numbers under scrutiny, no evidence for saturation of the logarithmic growth of the inner peak of the axial velocity variance is found. Although no outer peak of the velocity variance directly emerges in our DNS, we provide strong evidence that it should appear at

 abstract = {Direct Numerical Simulations have been performed for turbulent flow in circular pipes with smooth and corrugated walls. The numerical method, based on second-order finite discretization together with the immersed boundary technique, was validated and applied to various types of flows. The analysis is focused on the turbulence kinetic energy and its budget. Large differences have been found in the near-wall region at low Reynolds number. The change in the near-wall turbulent structures is responsible for increase of drag and turbulence kinetic energy. To investigatselinae the effects of wall corrugations, the velocity fields have been decomposed so as to isolate coherent and incoherent motions. For corrugated walls, we find that coherent motions are strongest for walls covered with square bars aligned with the flow direction. In particular, the coherent contribution is substantial when the bars are spaced apart by a distance larger than their height. Detailed analysis of the turbulence kinetic energy budget shows for this set-up a very different behavior than for the other types of corrugations.},

The problem isolates some aspects of three-dimensionality while avoiding others and can thus offer insights into the differences between two- and three-dimensional problems. The addition of a crossflow increases the size of the separation bubble quite substantially when normalized by the boundary-layer thickness or the momentum thickness but less substantially when normalized by the displacement thickness. All cases studied are found to have a very thin precursor separation bubble before the point of true separation that extends for at least one boundary-layer thickness but remains fully within the viscous sublayer. Simulations at different Reynolds numbers show that the flow reattaches after the precursor bubble at sufficiently high Reynolds number.},

Universality of the mean core scalar profile in defect form is recovered, with very nearly parabolic shape. Logarithmic growth of the buffer-layer peak of the scalar variance is found in the Reynolds number range under scrutiny, which well conforms with Townsend's attached-eddy hypothesis, whose validity is also supported by the spectral maps. The behaviour of the turbulent Prandtl number shows good universality in the outer wall layer, with values

The streamwise velocity and pressure fluctuations are processed according to their energy and frequency, respectively. As is the case of planar shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions, fluctuations in some bands of frequencies are more energetic downstream of the flow separation zone. The energetic low-frequency modes of the streamwise velocity fluctuations are reminiscent of Görtler-like vortices, whereas those of pressure fluctuations are connected with the “breathing” motion of the separation bubble. Higher-frequency modes, on the other hand, are related to wrinkling of the impinging conical shock. Although they bear resemblance with those in planar shock/turbulent boundary-layer interactions, it was found that the flow structures herein are less coherent owing to spanwise inhomogeneity of the impinging shock strength. The POD and DMD results of CSBLI support the notion that Görtler-like vortices might be an intrinsic mechanism of the interaction zone, which is probably responsible for the low-frequency unsteadiness of CSBLI. The present results may serve as a basic guidance for the design of fluidic control strategies of shock-induced flow separation.},

The mean pressure distribution is found to be qualitatively different from the case of channel flow, with an additional mean pressure difference caused by combined centrifugal and swirling effects. The variance of the pressure fluctuations exhibits a wide region with negative logarithmic decay with the wall distance, due to the presence of a hierarchy of wall-attached eddies, which we clearly trace in spectral maps, and which are generally isotropic in nature. On the other hand, the largest eddies are strongly non-isotropic, and are mainly elongated in the azimuthal direction.

 abstract = {We carry out a parametric study of hypersonic impinging shock-wave/turbulent-boundary-layer interactions (SBLIs) at hypersonic conditions (Mach number 6.0) by means of numerical simulation of the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations, with the eventual goal of establishing wall temperature and Reynolds number effects. Comparison with available direct numerical simulation and experimental data shows that RANS is capable of predicting the main features of SBLI, namely, typical size and distribution of the wall properties. A large number of flow cases were computed to examine the scaling of the global flow parameters over a wide range of wall temperatures and Reynolds numbers. As expected, the interaction zone is reduced as the wall is cooled, and as the Reynolds number is increased. A modified form of the scaling originally introduced by Souverein et al. [Journal of Fluid Mechanics, Vol. 714, 2013, pp. 505–535] is here considered to account for nonadiabatic wall state, which is found to successfully collapse the data to the distributions obtained for adiabatic flow, with some remaining deviations associated with low-Reynolds-number effects.},

 abstract = {The influence of turbulence inflow generation on direct numerical simulations (DNS) of high-speed turbulent boundary layers at Mach numbers of 2 and 5.84 is investigated. Two main classes of inflow conditions are considered, based on the recycling/rescaling (RR) and the digital filtering (DF) approach, along with suitably modified versions. A series of DNS using very long streamwise domains is first carried out to provide reliable data for the subsequent investigation. A set of diagnostic parameters is then selected to verify achievement of an equilibrium state, and correlation laws for those quantities are obtained based on benchmark cases. Simulations using shorter domains, with extent comparable with that used in the current literature, are then carried out and compared with the benchmark data. Significant deviations from equilibrium conditions are found, to a different extent for the various flow properties, and depending on the inflow turbulence seeding. We find that the RR method yields superior performance in the evaluation of the inner-scaled wall pressure fluctuations and the turbulent shear stress. DF methods instead yield quicker adjustment and better accuracy in the prediction of wall friction and of the streamwise Reynolds stress in supersonic cases. Unrealistically high values of the wall pressure variance are obtained by the baseline DF method, while the proposed DF alternatives recover a closer agreement with respect to the benchmark. The hypersonic test case highlights that similar distribution of wall friction and heat transfer are obtained by both RR and DF baseline methods.Graphical abstract},

 abstract = {The flow generated by the breaking of free-surface waves in a periodic domain is simulated numerically with a gas–liquid Navier–Stokes solver. The solver relies on the volume-of-fluid method to account for different phases, and the interface tracking is carried out by using novel schemes based on a tailored total-variation-diminishing limiter. The numerical solver is proved to be characterized by a low numerical dissipation, thanks to the use of a scheme that guarantees energy conservation in the discrete form. Both two- and three-dimensional simulations have been performed, and the analysis is presented in terms of energy dissipation, air entrainment, bubble fragmentation, statistics and distribution. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of the mechanisms of viscous dissipation. To this purpose, coherent vortical structures, such as vortex tubes and vortex sheets, are identified, and the different behaviours of the vortex sheets and tubes at various Reynolds numbers are highlighted. The correlation between vortical structures and energy dissipation demonstrates clearly their close link both in the mixing zone and in the pure water domain, where the coherent structures propagate as a consequence of the downward transport. Notably, it is found that the dissipation is identified primarily by the vortex sheets, whereas the vortex tubes govern mainly the intermittency.},

@article{pub.1153329307,
 abstract = {Fourier spectra have been traditionally used to get insight into the flow structures of turbulence. In wall-bounded flows usually these are not reported in Kolmogorov units. In this paper the spectra are evaluated in these units to compare them with those of isotropic turbulence, to investigate at which distance from the wall flow isotropy is achieved. We have found that improvement of the universality of the spectra in the near-wall region is achieved by evaluating the dissipative length scale from the total turbulence kinetic energy dissipation, rather than through the rate of isotropic dissipation as customary. The database of Lee and Moser (2015) for flow in plane channel and of Pirozzoli et al. (2021) for flow in a circular pipe have been considered. We have found similarity between pipe and channel flow up to a non-dimensional distance 0.2. At higher distances the spectra tend to become similar to isotropic ones in channels, whereas the geometry of the circular pipe prevents such collapse. Large part of the paper is also focused on turbulent natural convection in rectangular enclosures. In that flow, comparison between velocity and temperature spectra allows to answer about possible differences in the slope of the inertial ranges. In this respect, the importance of the bottleneck in the cascade of the kinetic and thermal energy is stressed. The large amplitude of the bottleneck in the temperature spectra might be the cause for the k^(−4/3) spectral range observed at wall distances greater than the thermal boundary layer thickness, defined in terms of the maximum turbulent thermal energy production. Also in this flow evaluating the Kolmogorov length scale through the total dissipation yields better collapse of the spectral range with exponential decay on that of isotropic turbulence in the near-wall region. Flow visualisations and joint PDF are used for deeper understanding of the complex physics of the turbulent convection.},

 abstract = {We present STREAmS-2.0, an updated version of the flow solver STREAmS, first introduced in Bernardini et al. (2021) [1]. STREAmS-2.0 has an object-oriented design which separates the physics equations from the specific back-end, making the code more suitable for future expansions, such as porting to novel computing architectures or implementation of additional flow physics. Similarly to the previous version, STREAmS-2.0 supports NVIDIA-GPU and CPU back-ends. Additionally, this version features improvements of the input/output data management, new energy and entropy preserving schemes for the discretization of the convective fluxes, recycling/rescaling inflow boundary condition, and a model for thermally perfect gases with variable specific heats. New version program Program Title: STREAmS CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/hdcgjpzr3y.2 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/STREAmS-CFD/STREAmS-2 Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: Fortran, CUDA Journal reference of previous version: M. Bernardini, D. Modesti, F. Salvadore, and S. Pirozzoli. STREAmS: a high-fidelity accelerated solver for direct numerical simulation of compressible turbulent flows. Comput. Phys. Commun. 263 (2021) 107906. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes. Reasons for the new version: New code structure and release of new features. Summary of revisions: • The original solver [1] has been rewritten following an object-oriented design implemented through Fortran derived types that include variables and type bound procedures. The new software architecture has been designed to increase modularity and extensibility of the code, allowing users to add new back-ends and physics equations while maintaining the same code structure. This allows users to reuse portions of the code that are independent of the physics equations, the back-end, or both. The layer of computing procedures maintains a lean structure that can be highly optimized with respect to the implemented back-end. • Input handling is now based on the classic .ini format improving both user readability and input data management. • A family of new kinetic energy and entropy preserving schemes (KEEP) are now available and can be selected for stable, non-dissipative and accurate spatial discretization of the convective terms of the Navier–Stokes equations in smooth flow regions [2]. Concerning the shock-capturing flux, the improved low-dissipative WENO-Z scheme proposed by [3] is now available. • New inflow boundary conditions based on the recycling/rescale approach [4] have been implemented for the simulation of spatially evolving compressible turbulent boundary layers. Moreover, a new inflow condition based on the solution of the compressible Blasius equation is available to take into account the case of laminar boundary layers. • The constitutive relations have been generalized to take into account thermally perfect gases with variable specific heats, approximated with polynomial functions of the temperature that can be specified by the user [5]. • A new stretching function has been implemented to improve the distribution of grid nodes for the computation of wall-bounded turbulent flows. The formulation blends uniform near-wall spacing with uniform resolution in terms of Kolmogorov units in the outer wall layer, guaranteeing accuracy with higher computational efficiency [6]. Nature of problem: The code solves the compressible Navier–Stokes equations in Cartesian coordinates for a thermally perfect gas. The solver is designed for direct numerical simulation (DNS) of compressible supersonic turbulent boundary layers and various canonical configurations are supported, including turbulent channel flow, laminar and turbulent boundary layer and shock-wave/boundary layer interaction. Solution method: The equations are discretized using high-order finite difference approximations with hybrid low-dissipative/shock-capturing capabilities and the time advancement is performed using a Runge–Kutta scheme.

                    We derive a scaling law for the characteristic frequencies of wall pressure fluctuations in swept shock wave/turbulent boundary layer interactions in the presence of cylindrical symmetry, based on analysis of a direct numerical simulations database. Direct numerical simulations in large domains show evidence of spanwise rippling of the separation line, with typical wavelength proportional to separation bubble size. Pressure disturbances around the separation line are shown to be convected at a phase speed proportional to the cross-flow velocity. This information is leveraged to derive a simple model for low-frequency unsteadiness, which extends previous two-dimensional models (Piponniau

Whereas cases with symmetric heating show close similarity between the temperature and the streamwise velocity fields, with turbulent structures confined to either half of the channel, in the presence of one-sided heating the temperature field exhibits larger regions with coherent fluctuations extending beyond the channel centreline. Validity of the logarithmic law for the mean temperature is confirmed, as well as universality of the associated von Kármán constant, which we estimate to be

 abstract = {Fourier spectra have been traditionally used to get insight into the flow structures of turbulence. In wall-bounded flows these are not reported usually in Kolmogorov units. In this paper the spectra are evaluated in these units to compare with the case of isotropic turbulence, to investigate at which distance from the wall flow isotropy is achieved. We have found that improvement of universality of the spectra in the near-wall region is achieved by evaluating the dissipative length scale from the total turbulence kinetic energy dissipation, rather than through the rate of isotropic dissipation as customary. The database of Lee and Moser [1] for flow in plane channel and of Pirozzoli et al. [2] for flow in a circular pipe have been considered. We have found similarities between pipe and channel flow up to a non-dimensional distance 0.2. Farther from the wall the spectra tend to become universal and similar to isotropic turbulence in channels, whereas the geometry of the circular pipe prevents universality. Large part of the paper is also focused on turbulent natural convection in rectangular enclosures. In that flow, comparison between velocity and temperature spectra allows to answer about possible differences in the slope of the inertial ranges. In this respect, the importance of the spectral bottleneck in the cascade of kinetic and thermal energy is stressed. The large amplitude of the bottleneck in the temperature spectra might be the cause for the k − 4 / 3 spectral range observed at wall distances greater than the thermal boundary layer thickness, defined in terms of the maximum turbulent thermal energy production. Also in this flow evaluating the Kolmogorov length scale through the total dissipation yields better collapse of the spectral range with exponential decay on that of isotropic turbulence in the near-wall region. Flow visualisations and joint PDFs are used for deeper understanding of the complex physics of turbulent convection.},

to push the boundaries of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), but despite the
consolidated trend towards the use of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs),
programmability is still an issue. STREAmS-2 (Bernardini et al. Comput. Phys.
Commun. 285 (2023) 108644) is a compressible solver for canonical wall-bounded
turbulent flows capable of harvesting the potential of NVIDIA GPUs. Here we
extend the already available CUDA Fortran backend with a novel HIPFort backend
targeting AMD GPU architectures. The main implementation strategies are
discussed along with a novel Python tool that can generate the HIPFort and CPU
code versions allowing developers to focus their attention only on the CUDA
Fortran backend. Single GPU performance is analysed focusing on NVIDIA A100 and
AMD MI250x cards which are currently at the core of several HPC clusters. The
gap between peak GPU performance and STREAmS-2 performance is found to be
generally smaller for NVIDIA cards. Roofline analysis allows tracing this
behavior to unexpectedly different computational intensities of the same kernel
using the two cards. Parallel performance is measured on the two largest
EuroHPC pre-exascale systems, LUMI (AMD GPUs) and Leonardo (NVIDIA GPUs).
Strong scalability reveals more than 80% efficiency up to 16 nodes for Leonardo
and up to 32 for LUMI. Weak scalability shows an impressive efficiency of over
95% up to the maximum number of nodes tested (256 for LUMI and 512 for
Leonardo). This analysis shows that STREAmS-2 is the perfect candidate to fully
exploit the power of current pre-exascale HPC systems in Europe, allowing users
to simulate flows with over a trillion mesh points, thus reducing the gap
between the Reynolds numbers achievable in high-fidelity simulations and those
of real engineering applications.},

The solver is validated through comparison with analytical solutions and with available experiments of vertical sloshing. We find that the computed forces acting on the tank walls are well predicted, both in two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations. The flow dynamics is found to be significantly affected by the forcing parameters, and to exhibit more chaotic and three-dimensional nature in cases with strong acceleration and low forcing frequency. As a consequence, certain properties such as the energy dissipation and the mixing efficiency of the system are poorly predicted by two-dimensional simulations in that range of parameters, necessitating the use of more expensive three-dimensional simulations. The time history of the sloshing force and instantaneous flow visualizations are used to analyze the effects of liquid impacting on the walls on energy exchanges between the fluid and the tank. Finally, the evolution of mixing efficiency and its influence on the energy losses are discussed.},

Upstream of the interaction, in the zero pressure gradient region, wall pressure statistics compare well with canonical compressible boundary layers in terms of fluctuation intensities and frequency spectra. Across the main interaction zone (APG1), the root-mean-square of wall pressure fluctuations becomes very large (corresponding to approximately 173.3 dB), with maximum increase approximately 12.7 dB from the incoming level. In the second adverse pressure gradient zone (APG2), the root-mean-square of wall pressure fluctuations attains a second peak (corresponding to    $164.7$   dB), with an increase of 8.4 dB from the upstream level. Both the APG1 and APG2 regions feature a substantial fraction of flow reversal events, which are, however, scattered and interspersed with regions of attached flow. The wall pressure power spectral density exhibits a broadband and energetic low-frequency component associated with the global unsteadiness of the separation bubble/conical shock system. Analysis of the two-point correlations and wavenumber/frequency spectra of wall pressure fluctuations further suggests that the typical eddies become more elongated along the spanwise direction, as the flow in the separated region tends to escape the centreline, and the convection velocity is significantly reduced. },

 abstract = {Traditionally, Fourier spectra have been employed to gain a deeper understanding of turbulence flow structures. The investigation of isotropic forced turbulence with passive scalars offers a straightforward means to examine the disparities between velocity and passive scalar spectra. This flow configuration has been extensively studied in the past, encompassing a range of Reynolds and Schmidt numbers. In this present study, direct numerical simulations (DNS) of this flow are conducted at sufficiently high Reynolds numbers, enabling the formation of a wide inertial range. The primary focus of this investigation is to quantitatively assess the variations in scalar spectra with the Schmidt number (Sc). The spectra exhibit a transition from a k−5/3 scaling for low Sc to a k−4/3 scaling for high Sc. The emergence of the latter power law becomes evident at Sc = 2, with its width expanding as Sc increases. To gain further insights into the underlying flow structures, a statistical analysis is performed by evaluating quantities aligned with the principal axes of the strain field. The study reveals that enstrophy is primarily influenced by the vorticity aligned with the intermediate principal strain axis, while the scalar gradient variance is predominantly controlled by the compressive strain. To provide a clearer understanding of the differences between enstrophy and scalar gradient variance, joint probability density functions (PDFs) and visualizations of the budget terms for both quantities are presented. These visualizations serve to elucidate the distinctions between the two and offer insights into their respective behaviors.},

 abstract = { We carry out direct numerical simulations of flow in a plane open channel at friction Reynolds number up to    ${{Re}}_{\tau } \approx 6000$   . We find solid evidence for the presence of universal large-scale organization in the outer layer, with eddies that are larger and stronger than in the closed channel flow. As a result, velocity fluctuations are found to be stronger than in closed channels, throughout the depth. The inner-layer peak of the streamwise velocity variance is observed to grow logarithmically, as in Townsend's attached-eddy model (Townsend, The Structure of Turbulent Shear Flow , 2nd edn, Cambridge University Press, 1976), but saturation of the growth cannot be discarded based on the present data. Although we do not observe a clear outer peak of the streamwise velocity variance, we present substantial evidence that such a peak should emerge at a Reynolds number barely higher than achieved herein. The most striking feature of the flow is the presence of an extended logarithmic layer, with associated Kármán constant asymptoting to    $k \approx 0.375$   , in line with observations made in shear-free Couette–Poiseuille flow (Coleman et al. , Flow Turbul.

The virtual absence of a wake region and of corrective terms to the log law in the present flow leads us to conclude that deviations from the log law observed in internal flows are likely due to the effects of the opposing walls, rather than the presence of a driving pressure gradient. },

 abstract = {Abstract The influence of rotor/stator interference on shockwave/boundary layer interaction is investigated by means of an implicit large-eddy simulation. To replicate actual turbomachinery conditions but at a lower cost, this work considers a transonic bump over which a shock-wave develops and interacts with the separated boundary layer. Moreover, the backpressure is set to fluctuate at a realistic reduced frequency. The analysis is focused on the coherent component of the flow and more particularly the turbulent stresses in the recirculation region. Phase-averaging is performed in order to highlight this component and the reference oscillator is based on the location of the separation point. Statistical convergence is assessed. Coherent turbulent stresses show a two-layers pattern, the upper layer being linked to the mixing layer and the inner layer developing below. The coherent component can reach up to 60% of the local mean value. Budgets show that only some production terms are significant and each of them is acting upon a specific layer of the associated coherent turbulent stress. Finally, pressure strain, responsible for the coupling between the transport equations, is also of importance.},

 abstract = {We carry out direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent flow in rough pipes. Two types of irregular roughness are investigated, namely a grit-blasted and a graphite surface. A wide range of Reynolds numbers is tested, from the laminar up to the fully rough regime, attempting to replicate Nikuradse's pioneering study. Despite the large relative roughness, outer-layer similarity is achieved at high Reynolds number as hypothesised by Townsend, with deviations from the smooth wall case of 4 % for the grit-blasted surface and 13 % for the graphite surface. This makes it possible to define a roughness function and the equivalent sand-grain roughness. The results are compared with those obtained in plane channels, with small differences pointing to the residual influence of the duct cross-sectional shape in the presence of relatively large roughness. The computed friction factors behave similar to those Nikuradse's chart, with differences in terms of the friction factor in the laminar region and of the critical Reynolds number, which are partly absorbed by using the hydraulic radius as reference length scale. The distributions of the velocity fluctuations intensities point to a isotropisation of turbulence in the near-wall region resulting from the roughness, with influence of the roughness geometry. Comparison of the computed equivalent sand-grain roughness height suggest that existing correlations suffer from poor predictive power, at least for surfaces with large relative roughness.},

 abstract = { We study turbulent flow in open channels with a free surface and rectangular cross-section, for various Reynolds numbers and duct aspect ratios. Direct numerical simulations are used to obtain accurate characterization of the secondary motions, which are found to be more intense than in closed ducts, and to scale with the bulk, rather than with the friction velocity. A notable feature of open-duct flows is the presence of a velocity dip, namely the peak velocity is achieved at some depth underneath the free surface. We find that the depth of the velocity peak increases with the Reynolds number, and correspondingly the flow becomes more symmetric with respect to the horizontal midplane. This is also confirmed from the change of the topology of the secondary motions, which exhibit a strong corner circulation at the free-surface/wall corners at low Reynolds number, which, however, weakens at higher    $Re$   . The structure of the mean velocity field is such that the log law applies with good approximation in the direction normal to the nearest wall, which allows us to explain why predictive friction formulae based on the hydraulic diameter concept are successful. Additional analysis shows that the secondary motions account for a large fraction of the frictional drag (up to    $15$    %). },

Specifically, the focus is on the dynamics of the interface between the fluids, which remains a challenge in many applications. Previous studies have primarily examined simpler flows with limited complexity, while real-world scenarios involve intricate interfaces and turbulent dynamics. To overcome this, a representative test case involving the motion of an oil cube within a water cube proposed by [12] is used. Different computational models using volume-of-fluid (VOF) approaches are validated and compared, with particular attention given to the influence of numerical schemes for convective terms. The impact of these schemes on integral quantities and interface dynamics is analyzed. Particular attention is paid at the surface tension contribution to the energy budgets, which is usually neglected in the available literature. Furthermore, it is shown here that, the model adopted for the surface tension is responsible for an additional contribution to numerical dissipation. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first time that a detailed analysis of such aspects is presented.},

The mean solution is, however, found to be independent of the perturbation. In a triple-decomposition framework, the coherent component of the flow is extracted by phase averaging. Organized structures of streamwise velocity and turbulence kinetic energy are highlighted. Whereas these structures are of similar shapes beneath the shock system, their extent in the downstream boundary layer is controlled by the frequency of the perturbation. The mean and harmonic turbulent stress budgets are presented. A typical three-peak distribution of mean turbulent diffusion is reported, which is also found to appear for coherent turbulent diffusion.

@article{pub.1169585749,
 abstract = {  Figure 1: Underwater vortical structures generated during the breaking: vortex-tubes and vortex-sheets are drawn in yellow and gray, respectively. The breaking of ocean waves is of significant interest due to its implications in various physical, chemical, and biological processes that occur at the ocean-atmosphere interface.  Wave breaking generates free-surface turbulence, dissipates wave energy, and enhances momentum, heat, and gas transfer between air and water. Over the years, a number of review articles and monographs have been published on the subject (Banner & Peregrine 1993; Melville 1996; Duncan 2001; Babanin 2011; Kiger & Duncan 2012; Perlin, Choi & Tian 2013; Lubin & Chanson 2017; Deike 2022), and these works call for more research into nearly every aspect of wave breaking. For these reason, the flow generated by the breaking of free-surface waves in a periodic domain is simulated numerically by means of a gas-liquid multiphase Navier Stokes solver. The solver relies on the Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) approach, and interface tracking is carried out by using a novel algebraic scheme based on a tailored TVD limiter (Pirozzoli et al., 2019). The solver is proved to be characterized by low numerical dissipation, thanks to the use of the MAC scheme, which guarantees discrete preservation of total kinetic energy in the case of a single phase. Both two- and three-dimensional simulations have been carried out, and the analysis is presented in terms of energy dissipation, air entrainment, bubble fragmentation, statistics and distribution. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of the mechanisms of viscous dissipation. For this purpose, coherent vortical structures (Horiuti and Takagi, 2005), are identified and the different behaviour of vortex sheets and vortex tubes are highlighted, at different Re. The correlation between vortical structures and energy dissipation demonstrates clearly their close link both in the mixing zone and in the pure water domain, where the coherent structures propagate as a consequence of the downward transport. Notably, it is found that the dissipation is primarily connected with vortex sheets, whereas vortex tubes are mainly related to flow intermittency. In order to highlight the connections between air entrainment and viscous dissipation with vortical structures, in fig. 2, slices taken in the longitudinal symmetry plane are drawn. The results display a very close correlation between viscous dissipation and the vortex sheet indicator. Also, it is worth noticing that viscous dissipation is not confined about the free surface, but it is spread within the bubble cloud. Within the high-dissipation regions, marked by the vortex sheet indicator, vortex tubes also form in zones with high vorticity.   Figure 2: Longitudinal sections of the solutions computed at Re = 10000 (top) and Re = 40000 (bottom). The coloured contours denote the local values of the normal-to-plane vorticity components (left), and the local dissipation rate (right). The black solid lines in left and right figures denote the vortex-tube and vortex-sheet iso-lines, respectively. Note that the solutions in the water domain are shown only.    },

Moreover, these sets of calculations are performed with and without vibrational excitation to further characterize the impact of this thermodynamic phenomenon on the flow. The presented calculations show that the variation of stagnation enthalpy and the presence of vibrational excitation are not able to qualitatively alter the structure of the flow. From a quantitative point of view, it is shown that the variation of the thermodynamic state of the gas can cause a 10% variation in the skin-friction coefficient, a 20% decrease in wall heat flux, and a shift in the typical frequencies of wall-pressure fluctuations by a factor of 2 toward higher frequencies.},

 abstract = {We carry out a numerical study of swept shock wave/turbulent boundary layer interaction in the hypersonic regime. Starting from a numerical/experimental benchmark case of a nearly adiabatic two-dimensional hypersonic interaction, a crossflow velocity component is added to the incoming flow to mimic three-dimensional interactions with cylindrical symmetry. We observe, for a fixed streamwise Mach number, monotonic increase of the extent of the interaction region for the swept cases. An attempt at extending the free-interaction theory to hypersonic swept interactions is made, which is found to apply only to the initial part of the interaction region. The spatiotemporal dynamics of wall pressure on mean separation line features large-scale pressure corrugations, which are advected at a phase speed which is a fraction of the mean crossflow velocity, if present. The characteristic wavelength of the corrugation is found to be a multiple of the separation bubble size. The numerically estimated peak frequencies well conform with the previously introduced formula for swept supersonic interactions [Ceci , J. Fluid Mech. 956, R1 (2023)10.1017/jfm.2023.2]. Proper orthogonal decomposition is applied to investigate the spatial structure of the corrugation at the separation point and educe phase relations between the flow structure and pressure oscillations at the reattachment point. The present analysis leads us to conclude that the same phenomenology found in swept supersonic interactions also holds in the hypersonic case.},
