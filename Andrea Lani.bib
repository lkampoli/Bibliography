By using advanced techniques and specific design patterns, flexibility and modularity are assured. COOLFluiD was recently adapted to support parallel computations on distributed memory machines. For this, a parallel layer was added, designed to minimize impact on both users and software developers, while maintaining high performance. From the user’s point of view, parallelisation is fully transparent. The techniques making this possible will be discussed. Also presented is a technique for reconciling generic programming with libraries requiring explicit type information.},

 abstract = {The carbuncle phenomenon is a critical numerical instability preventing the accurate simulation of hypersonic flows around blunted configurations. After reviewing the known remedies to handle numerically this instability (designed, all of them, for Finite Volume methods), we present and analyze in depth the only effective cure reported in literature for Residual Distribution schemes.The shock fix, which is formulated as a locally active artificial diffusive term, depends on a single controlling parameter ϵs. Extensive testing of the fix in combination with the Residual Distribution technique allows for the determination of an optimal value for ϵs, which can be related to a local Péclet-like number.After testing the performance of the fix in combination with the Residual Distribution technique it was originally designed for, the flexibility of the fix is demonstrated by coupling it with a cell-centered Finite Volume discretization: carbuncle instabilities are equally avoided in this case.Finally, a number of limitations identified in the first testing phase lead to the derivation of a more physically consistent, energy dissipative family of carbuncle fixes, whose improved capabilities are demonstrated.},

@article{pub.1007617494,
 abstract = {This work addresses the modeling of non-equilibrium phenomena in inductively coupled plasma discharges. In the proposed computational model, the electromagnetic induction equation is solved together with the set of Navier-Stokes equations in order to compute the electromagnetic and flow fields, accounting for their mutual interaction. Semi-classical statistical thermodynamics is used to determine the plasma thermodynamic properties, while transport properties are obtained from kinetic principles, with the method of Chapman and Enskog. Particle ambipolar diffusive fluxes are found by solving the Stefan-Maxwell equations with a simple iterative method. Two physico-mathematical formulations are used to model the chemical reaction processes: (1) A Local Thermodynamics Equilibrium (LTE) formulation and (2) a thermo-chemical non-equilibrium (TCNEQ) formulation. In the TCNEQ model, thermal non-equilibrium between the translational energy mode of the gas and the vibrational energy mode of individual molecules is accounted for. The electronic states of the chemical species are assumed in equilibrium with the vibrational temperature, whereas the rotational energy mode is assumed to be equilibrated with translation. Three different physical models are used to account for the coupling of chemistry and energy transfer processes. Numerical simulations obtained with the LTE and TCNEQ formulations are used to characterize the extent of non-equilibrium of the flow inside the Plasmatron facility at the von Karman Institute. Each model was tested using different kinetic mechanisms to assess the sensitivity of the results to variations in the reaction parameters. A comparison of temperatures and composition profiles at the outlet of the torch demonstrates that the flow is in non-equilibrium for operating conditions characterized by pressures below 30 000 Pa, frequency 0.37 MHz, input power 80 kW, and mass flow 8 g/s.},

The solenoidal constraint is handled by a hyperbolic divergence cleaning approach allowing its satisfaction up to machine accuracy. The conservation of the magnetic flux is computed in a consistent way using the numerical flux of the finite volume discretization. For the unsteady problem, the time accuracy is obtained by a Newton subiteration at each physical timestep thereby converging the solenoidal constraint to steady state.

 abstract = {This paper describes the main features of a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo solver for radiation transport which has been implemented within COOLFluiD, a world-class open source object-oriented platform for scientific simulations. The Monte Carlo code makes use of efficient ray tracing algorithms (for 2D, axisymmetric and 3D arbitrary unstructured meshes) which are described in detail. The solver accuracy is first verified in testcases for which analytical solutions are available, then validated for a space re-entry flight experiment (i.e. FIRE II) for which comparisons against both experiments and reference numerical solutions are provided. Through the flexible design of the physical models, ray tracing and parallelization strategy (fully reusing the mesh decomposition inherited by the fluid simulator), the implementation was made efficient and reusable.Program summaryProgram title: COOLFluiD-MCCatalogue identifier: AEZG_v1_0Program summary URL:http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEZG_v1_0.htmlProgram obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen’s University, Belfast, N. IrelandLicensing provisions: GNU General Public License, version 3No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 1990165No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 149533288Distribution format: tar.gzProgramming language: C++.Computer: From desktops to large HPC distributed systems.Operating system: Mac OS X, Linux.Has the code been vectorized or parallelized?: Parallelized through MPIRAM: Depending on the problem size from a few Megabytes to several Gigabytes.Classification: 21.2.External routines: MPI, boost, PETSc, ParMETIS, cmakeNature of problem: Radiative processes play a fundamental role in countless science and engineering contexts, including combustion, astrophysics, atmospheric space re-entry, experiments in plasma facilities (e.g. shock tubes, arc jets). The problem we are interested in is the computation of radiative heat transfer on arbitrarily complex geometries, in particular to characterize thermal loads acting on the surface of space vehicles.Solution method: Our C++ code implements a flexible and efficient Monte Carlo algorithm making use of state-of-the-art ray tracing techniques designed for and validated on arbitrary unstructured meshes. The code is organized as a collection of dynamically linked libraries connected to the computational kernel of the open source COOLFluiD platform. The Monte Carlo method is parallelized through mesh decomposition, while reusing the same partitioned mesh (and associated data structures) on which fluid dynamics equations are solved.Unusual features: The radiation transfer code of COOLFluiD-MC offers a unique combination of ray tracing algorithms suitable for handling 2D, 2D axisymmetric and 3D simulations on arbitrary unstructured grids. The parallelization strategy is scalable and based on domain decomposition. The overall object-oriented design allows for easy integration of new models and algorithms which can be plugged in dynamically through self-registration techniques.Additional comments: The code is part of a much larger set of COOLFluiD libraries, which are fully available on Github at https://github.com/andrealani/COOLFluiD and include multiple numerical solvers, physico-chemical models, processing algorithms and interfaces to third party scientific software. The CPC distribution also includes a state-of-the-art fully implicit Finite Volume solver for Euler and Navier–Stokes systems which is used to produce the flow solution for the radiative transport algorithm described in the paper. The aerothermodynamic solver, which is used for the final testcase (FIREII) in our paper, is based on the same core Finite Volume modules but on different physico-chemical and radiation models. The latter cannot be made available through the CPC library since they rely on third party libraries (MUTATION version 2.0 and PARADE version 3.1) which cannot be distributed due to NDA.!!!!! The distribution file for this program is over 149 Mbytes and therefore is not delivered directly when download or Email is requested. Instead a html file giving details of how the program can be obtained is sent. !!!!!Running time: Depending on the size of the computational grid, if it is 2D or 3D, on the number of processors used, the running time can vary from a few seconds up to hours or days. The testcases that are included with this version of the code, all using relatively small 2D or 3D meshes, run in 1–10 s each on 8 CPU-cores. The user is, however, totally free to run the same cases on a different number of cores (more or less, according to his/her convenience).},

 abstract = {We present a Finite Volume scheme for solving Maxwell's equations coupled to magnetized multi-fluid plasma equations for reactive and collisional partially ionized flows on unstructured meshes. The inclusion of the displacement current allows for studying electromagnetic wave propagation in a plasma as well as charge separation effects beyond the standard magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) description, however, it leads to a very stiff system with characteristic velocities ranging from the speed of sound of the fluids up to the speed of light. In order to control the fulfillment of the elliptical constraints of the Maxwell's equations, we use the hyperbolic divergence cleaning method. In this paper, we extend the latter method applying the CIR scheme with scaled numerical diffusion in order to balance those terms with the Maxwell flux vectors. For the fluids, we generalize the AUSM+-up to multiple fluids of different species within the plasma. The fully implicit second-order method is first verified on the Hartmann flow (including comparison with its analytical solution), two ideal MHD cases with strong shocks, namely, Orszag–Tang and the MHD rotor, then validated on a much more challenging case, representing a two-fluid magnetic reconnection under solar chromospheric conditions. For the latter case, a comparison with pioneering results available in literature is provided.},

In this chapter, a technique inspired by the artificial compressibility concept is developed. This technique is thought to be a cure for the drawbacks of the families of solenoidal constraint-satisfying techniques presented in the literature so far: incorrect shock capturing and poor performance of the convective stabilization mechanism in regions of stagnant flow for Powell’s source term method, exceedingly complex implementation for staggered-grid approaches, computationally expensive nature due to the necessity of a Poisson solver combined with hyperbolic and elliptic numerical methods for classical projection schemes. The new technique is in principle equivalent to the hyperbolic divergence cleaning technique advocated by other authors. However, the underlying derivation and justification are quite different. We apply our approach to a test case relevant to space weather predictions, a field-aligned (i.e., free-stream flow velocity and magnetic field are aligned) superfast-mode plasma around a quarter of a perfectly conducting cylinder, in which a complex dimpled bow shock topology occurs. The performance of our approach is demonstrated in terms of accuracy, robustness, and convergence speed.},

 abstract = {Abstract  In the present contribution we evaluate the heat flux prediction capabilities of second-order accurate Residual Distribution ( RD ) methods in the context of atmospheric (re-)entry problems around blunt bodies. Our departing point is the computation of subsonic air flows (with air modeled either as an inert ideal gas or as chemically reacting and possibly out of thermal equilibrium gas mixture) around probe-like geometries, as those typically employed into high enthalpy wind tunnels. We confirm the agreement between the solutions obtained with the RD method and the solutions computed with other Finite Volume ( FV ) based codes.   However, a straightforward application of the same numerical technique to hypersonic cases involving strong shocks exhibits severe deficiencies even on a geometry as simple as a 2D cylinder. In an attempt to mitigate this problem, we derive new variants of RD schemes. A comparison of these alternative strategies against established ones allows us to derive a diagnose for the shortcomings observed in the traditional RD schemes. },

 abstract = {Abstract
                  The variable high-order multiblock overlapping (overset) grids method of Sjögreen & Yee [CiCP, Vol. 5, 2009] for a perfect gas has been extended to nonequilibrium flows. This work makes use of the recently developed high-order well-balanced shock-capturing schemes and their filter counterparts [Wang et al., J. Comput. Phys., 2009, 2010] that exactly preserve certain non-trivial steady state solutions of the chemical nonequilibrium governing equations. Multiscale turbulence with strong shocks and flows containing both steady and unsteady components is best treated by mixing of numerical methods and switching on the appropriate scheme in the appropriate subdomains of the flow fields, even under the multiblock grid or adaptive grid refinement framework. While low dissipative sixth- or higher-order shock-capturing filter methods are appropriate for unsteady turbulence with shocklets, second- and third- order shock-capturing methods are more effective for strong steady or nearly steady shocks in terms of convergence. It is anticipated that our variable high-order overset grid framework capability with its highly modular design will allow for an optimum synthesis of these new algorithms in such a way that the most appropriate spatial discretizations can be tailored for each particular region of the flow. In this paper some of the latest developments in single block high-order filter schemes for chemical nonequilibrium flows are applied to overset grid geometries. The numerical approach is validated on a number of test cases characterized by hypersonic conditions with strong shocks, including the reentry flow surrounding a 3D Apollo-like NASA Crew Exploration Vehicle that might contain mixed steady and unsteady components, depending on the flow conditions.},

 abstract = {We present a reduced kinetic mechanism for the modeling of the behavior of the electronic states of the atomic species in air mixtures. The model is built by lumping the electronically excited states of the atomic species and by performing Maxwell-Boltzmann averages of the rate constants describing the elementary kinetic processes of the individual states within each group. The necessary reaction rate coefficients are taken from the model compiled by Bultel et al. [“Collisional-radiative model in air for earth re-entry problems,” Phys. Plasmas 13, 043502 (2006)10.1063/1.2194827]. The reduced number of pseudo-states considered leads to a significant reduction of the computational cost, thus enabling the application of the state of the art collisional radiative models to bi-dimensional and three-dimensional problems. The internal states of the molecular species are assumed to be in equilibrium. The rotational energy mode is assumed to quickly equilibrate with the translational energy mode at the kinetic temperature of the heavy species as opposed to the electronic and the vibrational modes, assumed to be in Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium at a common temperature TV. In a first step we validate the model by using simple zero- and one-dimensional test cases for which the full kinetic mechanism can be run efficiently. Finally, the reduced kinetic model is used to analyze the strong non-equilibrium flow surrounding the FIRE II flight experiment during the early part of its re-entry trajectory. It is found that the reduced kinetic mechanism is capable of reproducing the ionizational non-equilibrium phenomena, responsible for the drastic reduction of the radiative heat loads on the space capsules during the re-entry phase.},

The gas undergoing the expansion is an air plasma and consists of atoms, molecules, and free electrons. In the present analysis, the electronic excited states of atomic and molecular species are treated as separate pseudo-species. Rotational and vibrational energy modes are assumed to be populated according to Boltzmann distributions. The coupling between radiation and gas dynamics is accounted for, in simplified manner, by using escape factors. The flow governing equations for the steady quasi-one-dimensional flow are written in conservative form and discretized in space by means of a finite volume method. Steady-state solutions are obtained by using a fully implicit time integration scheme. The analysis of the evolution of the electronic distribution functions reveals a substantial over-population of the high-lying excited levels of atoms and molecules in correspondence of the nozzle exit. The influence of optical thickness is also studied. The results clearly demonstrate that the radiative transitions, within the optically thin approximation, drastically reduce the over-population of high-lying electronic levels.},

 abstract = {In order to study chromospheric magnetosonic wave propagation including, for the first time, the effects of ion–neutral interactions in the partially ionized solar chromosphere, we have developed a new multi-fluid computational model accounting for ionization and recombination reactions in gravitationally stratified magnetized collisional media. The two-fluid model used in our 2D numerical simulations treats neutrals as a separate fluid and considers charged species (electrons and ions) within the resistive MHD approach with Coulomb collisions and anisotropic heat flux determined by Braginskiis transport coefficients. The electromagnetic fields are evolved according to the full Maxwell equations and the solenoidality of the magnetic field is enforced with a hyperbolic divergence-cleaning scheme. The initial density and temperature profiles are similar to VAL III chromospheric model in which dynamical, thermal, and chemical equilibrium are considered to ensure comparison to existing MHD models and avoid artificial numerical heating. In this initial setup we include simple homogeneous flux tube magnetic field configuration and an external photospheric velocity driver to simulate the propagation of MHD waves in the partially ionized reactive chromosphere. In particular, we investigate the loss of chemical equilibrium and the plasma heating related to the steepening of fast magnetosonic wave fronts in the gravitationally stratified medium.},

 abstract = {We study magnetic reconnection under chromospheric conditions in five different ionization levels from 0.5% to 50% using a self-consistent two-fluid (ions + neutrals) model that accounts for compressibility, collisional effects, chemical inequilibrium, and anisotropic heat conduction. Results with and without radiation are compared, using two models for the radiative losses: an optically thin radiation loss function, and an approximation of the radiative losses of a plasma with photospheric abundances. The results without radiation show that reconnection occurs faster for the weakly ionized cases as a result of the effect of ambipolar diffusion and fast recombination. The tearing mode instability appears earlier in the low ionized cases and grows rapidly. We find that radiative losses have a stronger effect than was found in previous results as the cooling changes the plasma pressure and the concentration of ions inside the current sheet. This affects the ambipolar diffusion and the chemical equilibrium, resulting in thin current sheets and enhanced reconnection. The results quantify this complex nonlinear interaction by showing that a strong cooling produces faster reconnections than have been found in models without radiation. The results accounting for radiation show timescales and outflows comparable to spicules and chromospheric jets.},

The advantageous structure of the transformed advective Jacobian can be exploited by contour-integration-based Residual Distribution techniques: established schemes that operate on dense matrices can be substituted by the same scheme operating on the momentum–energy subsystem matrix and repeated application of scalar scheme to the mass-species and electronic-vibrational energy terms.

The code, which has been implemented within the open source COOLFluiD platform, is implicit, second-order in time and space, relying upon a Finite Volume method for the spatial discretization and a three-point backward Euler for the time integration. In particular, the convective fluxes are computed by a multi-fluid version of the AUSM+up scheme for the plasma equations, in combination with a modified Rusanov scheme with tunable dissipation for the Maxwell equations. Source terms are integrated with a one-point rule, using the cell-centered value. Some critical aspects of the porting to GPU’s are discussed, as well as the performance of two open source linear system solvers (i.e. PETSc, PARALUTION). The code design allows for computing both flux and source terms on the GPU along with their Jacobian, giving a noticeable decrease in the computational time in comparison with the original CPU-based solver. The code has been tested in a wide range of mesh sizes and in three different systems, each one with a different GPU. The increased performance (up to 14x) is demonstrated in two representative 2D benchmarks: propagation of circularly polarized waves and the more challenging Geospace Environmental Modeling (GEM) magnetic reconnection challenge.},

 abstract = {The present paper addresses the development and implementation of the first high-order Flux Reconstruction (FR) solver for high-speed flows within the open-source COOLFluiD (Computational Object-Oriented Libraries for Fluid Dynamics) platform. The resulting solver is fully implicit and able to simulate compressible flow problems governed by either the Euler or the Navier–Stokes equations in two and three dimensions. Furthermore, it can run in parallel on multiple CPU-cores and is designed to handle unstructured grids consisting of both straight and curved edged quadrilateral or hexahedral elements. While most of the implementation relies on state-of-the-art FR algorithms, an improved and more case-independent shock capturing scheme has been developed in order to tackle the first viscous hypersonic simulations using the FR method.

 abstract = {In order to study chromospheric magnetosonic wave propagation including, for
the first time, the effects of ion-neutral interactions in the partially
ionized solar chromosphere, we have developed a new multi-fluid computational
model, accounting for ionization and recombination reactions in gravitationally
stratified magnetized collisional media. The two-fluid model used in our 2D
numerical simulations treats neutrals as a separate fluid and considers charged
species (electrons and ions) within the resistive MHD approach with Coulomb
collisions and anisotropic heat flux determined by Braginskii's transport
coefficients. The electromagnetic fields are evolved according to the full
Maxwell equations and the solenoidality of the magnetic field is enforced with
a hyperbolic divergence cleaning scheme. The initial density and temperature
profiles are similar to VAL III chromospheric model in which dynamical, thermal
and chemical equilibrium are considered to ensure comparison to existing MHD
models and avoid artificial numerical heating. In this initial setup we include
simple homogeneous flux tube magnetic field configuration and an external
photospheric velocity driver to simulate the propagation of MHD waves in the
partially ionized reactive chromosphere. In particular, we investigate the loss
of chemical equilibrium and the plasma heating related to the steepening of
fast magnetosonic wave fronts in the gravitationally stratified medium.},

simulating ideal two-fluid plasmas on unstructured grids, taking profit of
GPGPU (General-purpose computing on graphics processing units). The code, which
has been implemented within the open source COOLFluiD platform, is implicit,
second-order in time and space, relying upon a Finite Volume method for the
spatial discretization and a three-point backward Euler for the time
integration. In particular, the convective fluxes are computed by a multi-fluid
version of the AUSM+up scheme for the plasma equations, in combination with a
modified Rusanov scheme with tunable dissipation for the Maxwell equations.
Source terms are integrated with a one-point rule, using the cell-centered
value. Some critical aspects of the porting to GPU's are discussed, as well as
the performance of two open source linear system solvers (i.e. PETSc,
PARALUTION). The code design allows for computing both flux and source terms on
the GPU along with their Jacobian, giving a noticeable decrease in the
computational time in comparison with the original CPU-based solver. The code
has been tested in a wide range of mesh sizes and in three different systems,
each one with a different GPU. The increased performance (up to 14x) is
demonstrated in two representative 2D benchmarks: propagation of circularly

Hypersonic computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are performed with a simplified chemical model including only neutral species, in order to calculate the flow field surrounding the ExoMars Schiapparelli module in flight conditions. A novel decoupled CFD approach is then applied where the calculation of the electron density is performed separately using a computationally inexpensive Lagrangian approach. Subsequently, a ray tracing algorithm is applied in order to model the propagation of electromagnetic waves in the wake flow past the ExoMars vehicle accounting for collisions between electrons and gas particles. The numerical results of the proposed novel approach for blackout analysis consisting of CFD, Lagrangian and ray tracing algorithms are in good agreement with the flight data.

This two-fluid model takes into account the ion-neutral collisions, ionization,

interactions between uncoupled ions and neutrals in the plasmas. In the present
numerical simulations, the initial density is specified to reach hydrostatic
equilibrium, and as a comparison, chemical equilibrium is also taken into
account to provide a density profile that differs from typical hydrostatic
equilibrium profiles. External velocity drivers are then imposed to generate
monochromatic acoustic waves. As is well known, the upward propagating acoustic
waves steepen in gravitationally stratified plasmas due to the exponentially
decreasing density, and they heat the plasmas in the nonlinear regimes where
kinetic energy is dissipated by shock waves and collisional interactions. In
particular, the lower ionization fraction resulting from the present initial
chemical equilibrium significantly enhances the heating efficiency. Moreover,
the ionization process absorbs a significant amount of energy, and the
decoupling between ions and neutrals is also enhanced while considering
ionization and recombination. Therefore, simulations without considering
ionization and recombination may overestimate the overall heating effects but
also underestimate the energy dissipation. The results also suggest that a more
accurate ionization and recombination model could be essential for improving
the modeling of partially ionized plasmas.},

 abstract = {<p>Space weather has the difficult task to try to anticipate the propagation of eruptive events such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in order to assess their possible impact on the Earth’s space environment. This requires an accurate description of the background in which CMEs propagate, mainly the continuum ejecta of particles that is the solar wind and the dynamo-generated heliospheric magnetic field. This proves challenging as the solar wind and dynamo magnetic field are interacting with each other depending on the activity cycle of our star, both at large and small scales. To be able to model accurately such a wide variety of scales and parameter regimes, the approach used by the EUHFORIA 2.0 project is to use a chain of models, taking advantage of existing codes to combine their strengths through numerical coupling across the heliosphere. The first step of this chain is the data-driven modeling of the inner corona, from photosphere measurements up until 0.1 AU, and it proves especially critical as it serves as boundary condition for the rest of the models.</p><p> </p><p>In that regard, we will present here two coronal MHD models implemented as an alternative to the semi-empirical WSA and SCS models used so far in EUHFORIA. By using the COOLFluiD framework, we developed a new coronal model with implicit solving methods and unstructured meshes, which proves faster than traditional explicit methods on regular grids. We used the coronal code Wind-Predict to benchmark this new model for the simple polytropic approximation in the first place, and we present the similarities and differences obtained for data-driven configurations and compare them with observations (white-light images, coronal hole boundaries, in-situ data at 1 AU after coupling with EUHFORIA). We then present the improvements foreseen for each codes, especially for the heating terms: Wind-Predict will incorporate self-consistent Alfvén waves while COOLFluiD will use ad-hoc heating terms and a multi-species treatment.

Therefore, the arrival time estimation depends on the accuracy of modelling the solar atmosphere and the complex interactions.

 abstract = {<p>Global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations have become an important tool for solar weather research. These simulations use solar magnetogram data to compute structures in the solar corona. We have developed one such model based on the COOLFLuiD platform and validated it through comparison with other state-of-art codes and observations (Leitner et al., 2022, submitted). Currently, further physics is added to the solver to move it from ideal MHD to full MHD, such as radiation, coronal heating or conduction. Description of this physics and its results is what is most usually discussed in papers concerning coronal MHD CFD. </p><p>However, physics is only one part of the solution when CFD is used. Actually, it is the numerics that is oftentimes the limiting factor, setting constraints on the accuracy and speed of these solvers. Many different problems can arise due to the finite discretisation of the domain or even due to the solver working with simplified ideal MHD equations instead of the full ones. It is rarely discussed what type of a computational grid should be used depending on the type of the simulations at hand, and it is mentioned even less often what type of errors and inaccuracies such an inappropriate grid type can cause. An unsuitable grid can also cause convergence problems and decrease the speed of the solver considerably (Brchnelova et al., 2022, submitted).</p><p>In our work, we investigate the sources of inaccuracies and errors which can compromise the global coronal MHD CFD results. We have observed that due to the large ranges of density magnitudes involved, spurious numerical fluxes can result on mesh cell interfaces when these cells are either highly skewed or the boundaries otherwise non-orthogonal. These spurious fluxes can create local errors of up to 40% in the velocity field in the most deformed portions of the computational grid. Further inaccuracies were observed also in the sharpness of the resulting velocity structures, this time due to artificially generated electric fields during the simulation. </p><p>Thus, in our talk, we will summarize the most important of the issues observed, their causes and potential means of their mitigation. For controlling the errors due to the spurious fluxes while simultaneously optimizing the performance of the solver, we will show a trade-off between different grid topologies and what to expect in the results. Similarly, to enhance the sharpness of the features, it will also be discussed how to mitigate the generation of artificial electric fields via careful formulation of the initial state and boundary conditions.</p>},

The r-refinement consists on nodal re-positioning while keeping the number of mesh nodes and their connectivity frozen. The developed algorithm is based on physics-driven spring-analogies, where the mesh can be seen as a network of fictitious springs. While AMR increases the local mesh density, the high-order Flux Reconstruction method potentially provides a more accurate detection of complex flow features over relatively coarser mesh, when compared to low-order methods. In this work, a concise overview of the Flux Reconstruction method and spring-based AMR techniques will be given, followed by some promising results of r-AMR applied to benchmark high-order steady-state supersonic flow simulations.},

 abstract = {This work presents the development of the first high-order Flux Reconstruction (FR) solver for flows governed by the compressible Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations including Laminar-Turbulent Transition (LTT). The solver is fully implicit and implemented in the open-source COOLFluiD platform. Both the k − ω ˜ Shear Stress Transport (SST) and the Langtry-Menter Local Correlation-Based Transition Model (LCTM) are implemented. Some modifications are made to the original k − ω SST model in order to obtain more robust and stable simulations. In particular, the natural logarithm of ω is transported and the equations are transformed accordingly. The implementation of the solver and the physics model are discussed in detail, as well as the residual Jacobian assembly algorithm and source term Jacobian treatment. In order to obtain adequate computational efficiency at higher orders, a semi-analytical Jacobian for the FR method is derived and investigated, as well as a specific Jacobian treatment to maintain stability and obtain favorable convergence characteristics. The solver is verified both in fully turbulent flow and in several transitional flow cases. The results of the verification cases are compared to references from the literature, showing a good agreement in all cases. Furthermore, it is shown that for increasingly high orders and fine meshes, the solver solutions coincide with each other, verifying grid independence. It is also shown that the FR method obtains accurate results on relatively coarse meshes, with a considerably larger first element height ( y 1 + ), i.e. up to y 1 + ≃ 25 , than state-of-the-art second-order finite volume solvers without wall-extended functions. Finally, the performance of the solver is briefly discussed, focusing on the scalability of the solver in terms of order of accuracy.},

@article{pub.1152951284,
 abstract = {This paper outlines the initial development of a novel magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) plasma control system which aims at mitigating shock-induced heating and the radio-frequency communication blackout typically encountered during (re-)entry into planetary atmospheres. An international consortium comprising universities, SMEs, research institutions, and industry has been formed in order to develop this technology within the MEESST project. The latter is funded by the Future and Emerging Technologies (FET) program of the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 scheme (grant no. 899298). Atmospheric entry imposes one of the harshest environments which a spacecraft can experience. The combination of hypersonic velocities and the rapid compression of atmospheric particles by the spacecraft leads to high-enthalpy, partially ionised gases forming around the vehicle. This inhibits radio communications and induces high thermal loads on the spacecraft surface. For the former problem, spacecraft can sometimes rely on satellite constellations for communicating through the plasma wake and therefore preventing the blackout. On the other hand, expensive, heavy, and non-reusable thermal protection systems (TPS) are needed to dissipate the severe thermal loads. Such TPS can represent up to 30% of an entry vehicles weight, and especially for manned missions they can reduce the cost- efficiency by sacrificing payload mass. Such systems are also prone to failure, putting the lives of astronauts at risk. The use of electromagnetic fields to exploit MHD principles has long been considered as an attractive solution for tackling the problems described above. By pushing the boundary layer of the ionized gas layer away from the spacecraft, the thermal loads can be reduced, while also opening a magnetic window for radio communications and mitigating the blackout phenomenon. The application of this MHD-enabled system has previously not been demonstrated in realistic conditions due to the required large magnetic fields (on the order of Tesla or more), which for conventional technologies would demand exceptionally heavy and power-hungry electromagnets. High-temperature superconductors (HTS) have reached a level of industrial maturity sufficient for them to act as a key enabling technology for this application. Thanks to superior current densities, HTS coils can offer the necessary low weight and compactness required for space applications, with the ability to generate the strong magnetic fields needed for entry purposes. This paper provides an overview of the MEESST project, including its goals, methodology and some preliminary design considerations.},

Here we present numerically obtained results for two extremes of the solar activity cycle represented by CR 2161 and CR 2219 for solar maximum and minimum, respectively. We discuss the impact of reconstruction level on representative solar corona solutions and thus also the impact of small magnetic structures on the overall structure of the solar wind. Moreover, both cases correspond to particular solar eclipses, namely those in 2015 March and 2019 July, to allow us the direct comparison of simulations with observed coronal features. We use a validation scheme proposed by Wagner et al. (from less to more sophisticated methods, i.e., visual classification, feature matching, streamer direction and width, brute force matching, topology classification). The detailed comparison with observations reveals that our model recreates relevant features such as the position, direction, and shape of the streamers (by comparison with white-light images) and the coronal holes (by comparison with extreme ultraviolet images) for both cases of minimum and maximum solar activity.

The latter is based on the numerical solution of the 3D Eikonal system of equations, offering a fast, efficient and accurate method to analyse the interaction between electromagnetic signals and weakly ionised plasmas.

 abstract = {Connectivity between our star and our planet is a huge but necessary challenge. Indeed, remote-sensing instruments allow us to observe with great details the surface of the Sun, while in-situ measurements let us see the consequences at Earth. However, it it not always easy to understand the link between the two, thus preventing us from understanding the propagation of physical effects. One way to chase this connection is to use the magnetic field: although not visible, open magnetic field bathes the entire heliosphere, and has a major influence on plasma and particle events such as CMEs or flares. We can typically use numerical simulations to estimate the magnetic field lines pattern, and thus help connecting remote-sensing with in-situ observations. In this study, we will present our computation of the magnetic connectivity through the heliosphere by coupling the MHD codes COCONUT for the solar corona and EUHFORIA for the inner heliosphere. MHD codes are usually too slow to compute connectivity on a near-real time cadence, but this chain of model can be optimised to run in less than 6 hours, which allows refined tracking within a single day. We will explain how the coupling between the code operates, as it effects the tracing of the magnetic field lines. We will also explain how to provide uncertainties with this method. We will first show the validation of our method by comparison with PFSS and wind ballistic mapping, for both polar and equatorial open coronal holes, on several test cases that were already used in previous studies. This will allow us to discuss the impact of the magnetic modelling on the connectivity estimation. Finally, we will also discuss the impact of the input magnetic map by comparing 20 different runs for the same Carrington rotation at minimum of activity, based on various maps from different providers.},

 abstract = {Some space weather forecasting tools, such as the EUropean Heliosphere FORecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA), consist of two parts. The first is a semi-empirical coronal model used to create the background solar wind, and the second is a heliospheric model in which coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are injected through the inner boundary located at 0.1 AU. In these models, the inserted CME does not interact with the solar wind before the inner boundary. To take this interaction into account and provide a more realistic description of CMEs at 0.1 AU. We studied the propagation of flux ropes from the solar surface to 0.1 AU in a full magnetohydrodynamic coronal model called COCONUT (COolfluid COroNal UnsTructured). The CMEs were modeled using the modified Titov-Démoulin model (TDm) of flux rope. We tracked the evolution of twenty four different twisted flux ropes within realistic corona configurations reconstructed by COCONUT from the GONG magnetic maps of both minimum and maximum solar activity. All CMEs are identical except for their net initial current. Our results reflect dynamic expected by the standard flare model, such as presence of post-flare loops and the pinching of the CME's legs. However, the shape of the CME varies greatly depending on whether the solar wind corresponds to a minimum or a maximum activity, highlighting the crucial role of the solar wind in determining the geometry of CMEs. Once the flux ropes reach 0.1 AU, their thermodynamic and magnetic properties are extracted. We found that, for the two solar wind configurations, the synthetic profiles obtained are consistent with those that satellites could measured. Moreover, simple relationships are emphasised between the net initial current of flux ropes and the shape of the different synthetic profiles.  Finally, using this CME description, the boundary conditions imposed on EUHFORIA (or other heliospheric models) should be more accurate than those provided by an independent CME model and therefore lead to more realistic forecasts.​ },

slowly making their way into the space weather modeling toolchains to replace
the semi-empirical methods such as the Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model. However,
since they are based on CFD, if the assumptions in them are too strong, these
codes might experience issues with convergence and unphysical solutions.
Particularly the magnetograms corresponding to solar maxima can pose problems
as they contain active regions with strong magnetic fields, resulting in large
gradients. Combined with the approximate way in which the inner boundary is
often treated, this can lead to non-physical features or even a complete
divergence of the simulation in these cases. Here, we show some of the possible
approaches to handle this inner boundary in our global coronal model COolfluid
COrona uNstrUcTured (COCONUT) in a way that improves both convergence and
accuracy. Since we know that prescribing the photospheric magnetic field for a
region that represents the lower corona is not entirely physical, first, we
look at the ways in which we can adjust the input magnetograms to remove the
highest magnitudes and gradients. Secondly, since in the default setup we also
assume a constant density, here we experiment with changing these values
locally and globally to see the effect on the results. We conclude, through
comparison with observations and convergence analysis, that modifying the
density locally in active regions is the best way to improve the performance
both in terms of convergence and physical accuracy from the tested approaches.},

In order to anticipate the geoeffectiveness of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), heliospheric simulations are used to propagate transient structures injected at 0.1 AU. Without direct measurements near the Sun, the properties of these injected CMEs must be derived from models coming from observations or numerical simulations, and thus they contain a lot of uncertainty.   Aims. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the possible use of the new coronal model COCONUT to compute a detailed representation of a numerical CME at 0.1 AU after its injection at the solar surface and propagation in a realistic solar wind, as derived from observed magnetograms.

order to achieve robustness and fast convergence to steady-state, several

the inner boundary, resulting in an unrealistically high plasma beta.In this
paper, we examine the effects of prescribing such filtered magnetograms and

reduces the prescribed plasma beta and leads to a more realistic setup. The

This filtering leads to smoothing and lower magnetic field values at the inner boundary (i.e. the solar surface), resulting in an unrealistically high plasma β (greater than 1 in a large portion of the domain).   Aims. We aim to examine the effects of prescribing such filtered magnetograms in global coronal simulations and formulate a method for achieving more realistic plasma β values and improving the resolution of electromagnetic features without losing computational performance.   Methods. We made use of the newly developed COCONUT solver to demonstrate the effects of the highly pre-processed magnetic maps set at the inner boundary and the resulting high plasma β on the features in the computational domain. Then, in our new approach, we shifted the inner boundary to 2 R ⊙ from the original 1.01 R ⊙ and preserved the prescribed highly filtered magnetic map. With the shifted boundary, the boundary density and pressure were also naturally adjusted to better represent the considered physical location. This effectively reduces the prescribed plasma β and leads to a more realistic setup.

 abstract = {Spacecraft entering a planetary atmosphere are surrounded by a plasma layer containing high levels of ionization, due to the extreme temperatures in the shock layer. The high electron number densities cause attenuation of the electromagnetic waves emitted by the on-board antennas, leading to communication blackout for several minutes. This work presents experimental measurements of signal propagation through an ionized plasma flow. The measurements are conducted at the VKI plasma wind tunnel (Plasmatron) using conical horn antennas transmitting in the Ka-band, between 33 and 40 GHz. Testing conditions at 15, 50 and 100 mbar, and powers between 100 and 600 kW cover a broad range of the testing envelope of the Plasmatron as well as a broad range of atmospheric entry conditions. The transmitting antenna is characterized at the UPC anechoic chamber, obtaining the radiation patterns, beamwidth, and gain at the boresight direction; and an optical ray tracing technique is used to describe the electromagnetic waves propagation in the plasma flowfield inside of the Plasmatron chamber. The signal propagation measurements show clear attenuation when the signal is propagating through the plasma, varying between 2 and 15 dB depending on the testing conditions. This attenuation increases with electron number densities, which are driven by the Plasmatron power and pressure settings. Preliminary evidence of Faraday rotation effects caused by the plasma is also observed.},

 abstract = {Context. The global coronal model COCONUT (COolfluid COronal uNstrUcTured) was originally developed to replace semi-empirical models such as the Wang-Sheeley-Arge model in space weather forecasting chains in order to improve the physical accuracy of the predictions. This model has, however, several simplifications implemented in its formulation to allow for rapid convergence in an operational setting. These simplifications include the assumptions that the plasma is fully ionised, sufficiently collisional, and that quasi-neutrality holds, so that it can be modelled as a single fluid. This means that all interactions with the low-concentration neutral fluid in the corona, such as collisions or charge exchange, are neglected. Aims. In this paper, we have two goals. Firstly, we aim to introduce a novel multi-fluid global coronal model and validate it with simple cases (like a magnetic dipole) as well as with real data-driven applications. Secondly, we aim to investigate to what extent considering a single-fluid plasma in the global coronal model might affect the resulting plasma dynamics, and thus whether the assumptions on which the single-fluid coronal model is based are justified. Methods. We developed a multi-fluid global coronal model following the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) COCONUT model, COCONUT-MF, which resolves the ion and neutral fluid equations separately. While this model is still steady-state and thus does not resolve unsteady processes, it can account for resistivity, charge exchange, and chemical (ionisation and recombination) and collisional contributions due to the presence of the neutrals in the fluid equations. Results. We present the results of the ion-neutral COCONUT-MF modelling for a magnetic dipole, a minimum of solar activity case (August 1, 2008), and a solar maximum case (March 9, 2016). Through comparison with the ideal MHD results, we confirm that the resolved multi-fluid solver features are physical and also demonstrate the higher accuracy of the applied upwind numerical flux scheme compared to the one used in the original MHD model. Subsequently, we also repeat the multi-fluid simulations while excluding the charge exchange and the chemical and collisional terms to evaluate the effect these terms have on the resulting plasma dynamics. It is observed in numerical results that, despite the very low concentration of neutrals, they still do affect the flow field to a limited but non-negligible extent (up to 5 to 10% locally), with a higher impact being seen in the case of the solar maximum. It is also demonstrated that the collisional terms are primarily responsible for the neutrals adopting the electromagnetic profiles of the ions, while the charge exchange and chemical terms yield the largest thermal effects of the neutrals on the ion plasma. Despite the fact that the coronal plasma is generally assumed to be collisionless, our results show that there is sufficient collisionality in it to couple the two fluids. Conclusions. We present a novel multi-fluid global coronal model that can separately simulate the behaviour of the ion and neutral fluids. Using this model, we also show that in our set-up, in which the chromosphere is not considered and steady-state solutions are assumed, the presence of the neutrals affects the flow field, though to a limited extent. It is shown that this effect is larger when the flow field is more complex due to a higher magnetic activity. This analysis may change in the future when the global coronal model will be extended to include the lower atmospheric layers as well as terms to model coronal heating, radiation, and thermal conduction. To that end, the current model may need to be further calibrated to better represent the different layers of the atmosphere. We presume that the use of the proposed COCONUT-MF set-up will then be necessary and new numerical experiments will need to be performed in order to confirm this hypothesis.},

Moreover, our findings strongly suggest that magnetic reconnection during the CME propagation plays a critical role in destroying the coherent characteristics of a CME flux rope. },

@article{pub.1169419980,
 abstract = {This paper investigates the role of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on the aerothermodynamics (ATD) of a representative entry vehicle while flying into the Martian atmosphere. By strategically placing a flight-ready superconducting magnet at varied positions in the Schiaparelli reentry capsule of the ExoMars mission, we discern its impact on essential flow properties. The primary consequence of MHD during atmospheric entry is the generation of the Lorentz force, which increases the shock standoff distance resulting in a reduction of the heat flux on the spacecraft by pushing high-energy plasma particles away. Through different magnet configurations, three distinct cases are formed to comprehensively understand the effects and implications of each setup. The study is performed using the COOLFluiD MHD for EnTries, an in-house ATD solver. For case 1, the magnet's placement behind the ExoMars forebody at the stagnation point reduces the heat flux. In case 2, the magnet's relocation to the shoulder region explores its potential to mitigate communication blackouts by influencing the wake region's flow. However, this positioning also induces shock bending, leading to variations in post-shock species mass fractions and heat flux spikes in the post-shock region. Case 3, involving an additional magnet where the shock bends in case 1, showcases a consistent increase in shock standoff distance across the forebody, providing a longer relaxation zone for species equilibration. Our findings highlight that while the strength of the applied magnetic field is crucial, the magnet's size is equally pivotal in determining ATD behavior. Case 3 emerges as the most promising configuration, consistently reducing heat flux across the forebody and maintaining it in the afterbody. This study underscores the potential of multi-magnet configurations as next-generation MHD heat shields for Martian atmospheric entry, emphasizing the criticality of magnet placement and configuration in enabling future MHD-enhanced deep space exploration missions.},

@article{pub.1169589396,
 abstract = {Space weather events can affect Earth. In order to mitigate damage, space weather modelling tools have been implemented. In this study, the full MHD chain is presented, starting from the Sun, with a 3D MHD data-driven coronal model COCONUT up to 0.1 AU, where the code is coupled to Icarus, an ideal 3D MHD heliospheric modelling tool. COCONUT (Perri, Leitner et al. 2022, COolfluid COrona Unstructured) is a data-driven coronal model that was recently developed at the Centre for Mathematical Plasma Astrophysics, KU Leuven. It is a global 3-D MHD model based on the COOLFluiD code (Yalim et al. 2011, Lani et al. 2014). The advantage of the COCONUT model lies in its efficient, optimised implementation. It uses a time-implicit backward Euler scheme and unstructured computational grid, which avoids singularities near the poles and enables using high CFL numbers to rapidly converge to steady state for realistic simulations on modern HPC systems. In order to obtain realistic solar wind conditions at 0.1AU, the source terms have been implemented in the MHD equations, namely, the approximated coronal heating function, radiative losses and the thermal conduction. The output of the COCONUT coronal model is used as input boundary conditions for plasma variables in the heliospheric model Icarus. Icarus (Verbeke et al. 2022, Baratashvili et al. 2022) is a new heliospheric wind and CME evolution model that is implemented within the framework of MPI-AMRVAC (Xia et al., 2018) and introduces new capabilities for better and faster space weather forecasts. Advanced numerical techniques, such as solution adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and radial grid stretching, are implemented. These techniques result in optimised computer memory usage and a significant execution speed-up, which is crucial for forecasting purposes. The modelled 3D data in the solar corona and heliosphere are presented for assessing the model capabilities. The density profiles near the Sun are compared to tomography data. The time-series profiles of different variables at Earth are compared to observational data. As a result, the COCONUT+Icarus model chain represents the full MHD model covering the domain from Sun to Earth, which allows more in depth studies and understanding of different physics phenomena, e.g. shock formation, erosion, and deformation, compared to empirical or semi-empirical models. },

@article{pub.1171108177,
 abstract = {Avoiding radio communication blackouts during atmospheric entry is crucial to a space mission and can be life-saving. A novel ray-tracing algorithm, called Blackout Ray Tracer (BORAT), based on a Snell’s law solver, is introduced to analyze the signal behavior during reentry using geometrical optics for nonmagnetized and magnetized plasma. The ray-tracing analysis is performed on Knapp’s case fluid simulations provided by the University of Stuttgart. The effect of an applied magnetic field on ray tracing is discussed and visualized using radiation patterns. The results suggest that a sufficiently strong magnetic field is promising to mitigate radio communication blackouts.},

@article{pub.1173580058,
 abstract = {High heat flux and radio blackout are well-known challenges space vehicles have been facing during re-entry into a planet’s atmosphere since the early days of space-flight. Thermal protection systems have been developed to protect spacecraft and astronauts, however, they are often heavy and some have to be replaced after each mission. High temperatures in the compressed gas in the shock wave lead to partial ionization. The dense plasma can cause radio blackout, i.e. attenuation or reflection of radio waves thus blocking data-telemetry and communication with ground stations or satellites. One approach to solve both problems is to influence the plasma with magnetohydrodynamic effects using a strong magnet. In the framework of the European project MEESST (Magnetohydrodynamic Enhanced Entry System for Space Transportation) heat flux mitigation and radio blackout mitigation is investigated by means of modelling and ground experiments in plasma wind tunnels at the Institute of Space Systems (Stuttgart, Germany) and at the Von Karman Institute for Fluid Dynamics (Brussels, Belgium) using an HTS magnet. After a short introduction to the scientific background of the MEESST project, the boundary conditions for the design of the magnet and calculations of field distributions are presented. The pancake coils of the magnet were wound with a robotic winding system. Results from a preliminary test of the conduction-cooled magnet are presented.},
