 abstract = { We present the quantum mechanical (QM) and quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) dynamics of the title reaction on two uncoupled surfaces, using a wavepacket (WP) method and considering some N2(v, j) vibrational and rotational states. The reaction is investigated by calculating initial-state-resolved reaction probabilities, cross sections, and rate constants, which are explained in terms of energy profiles and collision mechanisms. These properties reflect the large endo-thermicity of the reaction and the features of the surfaces. Indeed, at low v values we obtain large thresholds and the lower surface is more reactive than the higher one, whereas at high v the thresholds decrease or disappear and the upper surface becomes more reactive. QM and QCT results are in satisfactory agreement, except some differences at low or high collision energy and temperature. QCT rate coefficients agree also with some published results. WP snapshots and movies of QCT time evolution show clearly abstraction and insertion mechanisms depending on the initial conditions. Insertion proceeds via a reaction complex and we observe a QM Feshbach resonance for a specific initial condition. On the overall, the dynamical observables are consistent with the collision mechanisms.},

 abstract = {In the present paper, state-to-state model of vibrational-chemical kinetic and transport processes is applied to study heat and mass transfer in non-equilibrium flows of CO2 and air mixtures under atmospheric entry conditions. Different contributions to the heat flux typical for the state-to-state approach are considered: fluxes due to heat conduction, mass diffusion, thermal diffusion, and diffusion of vibrational energy. For several test cases, vibrational distributions, chemical composition, temperature profiles as well as the transport coefficients and heat flux are calculated along the stagnation line. Various models for diffusion velocities are considered. For a non-catalytic surface, the role of thermal diffusion process is found to be important in some test cases. Prandtl and Schmidt numbers are calculated along the stagnation line, and it is shown that they are essentially non-constant. The influence of Prandtl and Schmidt numbers on the diffusion velocities and heat flux is evaluated.},

 abstract = {The paper presents a comparative study of vibrational-chemical kinetics and heat transfer in carbon dioxide flows under Mars entry conditions for two classes of models: the state-to-state and multitemperature models. The state-to-state approach treats each vibrational state of a molecule as a separate chemical species, thus providing a very detailed flow description. Reduced multitemperature models are based on nonequilibrium quasi-stationary Boltzmann distributions over vibrational energy with vibrational temperatures of different modes. Implementation of multitemperature models requires much less computational effort, making them rather attractive for engineering applications. Simulations have been performed for the upper part of the Mars Pathfinder entry trajectory. Comparisons between different models demonstrate a good agreement for the flowfield variables obtained using the state-to-state and multitemperature approaches, except some discrepancies for the species mole fractions prediction. This conclusion is encouraging for computational fluid dynamics, since it confirms that multitemperature models, while not being so much detailed as state to state, are still able to capture the main peculiarities of thermal and chemical nonequilibrium flows. The transport and thermochemical models have been validated using experimental data obtained in the NASA Hypersonic Pulse ground test facility. It is shown that both state-to-state and advanced multitemperature transport models used in the present simulations provide a better agreement for the heating predictions compared to traditional models.},

An N2/N/O2/O/NO mixture is considered to simulate the space vehicle Earth re-entry problem. Two new sets of state-to-state rate coefficients of the processes O+N2(v)↔NO(w)+N and N+O2(v)↔NO(w)+O are used, calculated in our research group by means of a molecular dynamics approach.Particular attention is payed to rescale the rates of different kinetic processes in order to have a unique vibrational scale for each molecular species (N2, O2, NO). This is not obvious because vibrational levels, obtained from asymptotics of three-body potential of different collisional systems, often do not match, particularly for high-lying vibrational states. The reactions involving NO affect the mass fractions, the molecular vibrational distributions and the heat flux in the boundary layer.},

 abstract = {The modeling of atmospheric gas, interacting with the space vehicles in re-entry conditions in planetary exploration missions, requires a large set of scattering data for all those elementary processes occurring in the system. A fundamental aspect of re-entry problems is represented by the strong non-equilibrium conditions met in the atmospheric plasma close to the surface of the thermal shield, where numerous interconnected relaxation processes determine the evolution of the gaseous system towards equilibrium conditions. A central role is played by the vibrational exchanges of energy, so that collisional processes involving vibrationally excited molecules assume a particular importance. In the present paper, theoretical calculations of complete sets of vibrationally state-resolved cross sections and rate coefficients are reviewed, focusing on the relevant classes of collisional processes: resonant and non-resonant electron-impact excitation of molecules, atom–diatom and molecule–molecule collisions as well as gas-surface interaction. In particular, collisional processes involving atomic and molecular species, relevant to Earth (N2, O2, NO), Mars (CO2, CO, N2) and Jupiter (H2, He) atmospheres are considered.},

The model adopted treats three CO2 modes (the two degenerated bending modes are approximated as a unique one) as not independent ones. Vibrational-translational transitions in the bending mode, inter-mode exchanges within CO2 molecule and between molecules of different chemical species as well as dissociation-recombination reactions are considered. Attention is paid to the electron-CO2 collisions that cause transitions from the ground vibrational state, CO2(0,0,0), to the first excited ones, CO2(1,0,0), CO2(0,1,0) and CO2(0,0,1). The corresponding processes rate coefficients are obtained starting from the electron energy distribution function, calculated either as an equilibrium Boltzmann distribution at the local temperature or by solving the Boltzmann equation.Results obtained either neglecting or including in the kinetic scheme the electron-CO2 collisions are compared and explained by analysing the rate coefficients of the electron-CO2 collisions.},

Cross sections are calculated as a function of collision energy in the range 0.001-10 eV, considering the whole rovibrational ladder. Some problems related to the vibrational energy levels of the asymptotes of <sup>3</sup>A″ and <sup>3</sup>A' potential energy surfaces used in this work are solved by an appropriate scaling at the level of cross sections. The results are compared with data in the literature, obtaining excellent agreement with experimental thermal data for reactive processes on a very large temperature range, and reasonable agreement with indirect dissociative data. Significant discrepancies are observed with previous reactive state-to-state results calculated on less detailed potential energy surfaces. Inelastic results are compatible with extrapolation of experimental thermal rate coefficient for temperatures higher than 4500 K but completely fail to reproduce experimental data at room temperature. The issue is discussed, indicating the reasons and possible solutions to the problem, and a resonable rate coefficient is obtained combining experimental and theoretical results in the range 300-20000 K. Complete, accurate fits are provided for both reactive and dissociative state-to-state rate coefficients to use them in applicative numerical codes concerning air kinetics.},

The CO2 molecule is detailed in its symmetric stretching, bending and asymmetric stretching modes, which are strongly coupled through inter-mode vibrational energy transfers. Two sets of rate coefficients for the vibrational energy transitions are used. Different kinetic schemes including various physical and chemical processes are assessed. The heat flux is calculated, in the framework of the modified Chapman–Enskog theory, accounting for the vibrational states of involved molecules. Comparisons with results obtained using a simplified model, including mainly vibrational levels of the asymmetric stretching mode, are carried out. It is shown that VT transitions in the symmetric and asymmetric modes do not alter the flow and can be neglected. The heat flux is not sensitive to the rates of vibrational energy transitions but depends noticeably on the processes implemented to the kinetic scheme. Using the simplified model yields under-predicted surface heat fluxes; nevertheless we can recommend it for fast estimates of the fluid dynamic variables and heat transfer in hypersonic flows since its implementation essentially reduces computational costs.},

CO<sub>2</sub> symmetric, bending and asymmetric vibrations and dissociation-recombination are strongly coupled through intermode vibrational energy transfers. Comparative study of state-resolved rate coefficients is carried out; the effect of different transitions may vary considerably with temperature. A nonequilibrium 1-D boundary layer flow typical to hypersonic planetary entry is studied in the state-to-state approach. To assess the sensitivity of fluid-dynamic variables and heat transfer to various vibrational transitions and chemical reactions, corresponding processes are successively included to the kinetic scheme. It is shown that vibrational-translational (VT) transitions in the symmetric and asymmetric modes do not alter the flow and can be neglected whereas the VT<sub>2</sub> exchange in the bending mode is the main channel of vibrational relaxation. Intermode vibrational exchanges affect the flow implicitly, through energy redistribution enhancing VT relaxation; the dominating role belongs to near-resonant transitions between symmetric and bending modes as well as between CO molecules and CO<sub>2</sub> asymmetric mode. Strong coupling between VT<sub>2</sub> relaxation and chemical reactions is emphasized. While vibrational distributions and average vibrational energy show strong dependence on the kinetic scheme, the heat flux is more sensitive to chemical reactions.},

 abstract = {Coupled state-to-state vibrational-chemical kinetics, gas dynamics, and heat transfer in the five-component mixture of dissociated CO<sub>2</sub> are studied using the complete three-mode kinetic model and the reduced scheme involving mainly the vibrational states of the asymmetric mode. The emphasis is on the effect of asymmetric vibrations on the rate of dissociation, fluid dynamic variables, and heat flux. It is shown that intermode vibrational energy transitions between CO and CO<sub>2</sub> asymmetric mode may considerably decrease the rate of dissociation; the presence of CO in the mixture quickly depletes high vibrational states and thus inhibits dissociation at low temperatures. The reduced model overpredicts populations of highly located states of the asymmetric mode, especially when intermode VV transitions are neglected; therefore, using the simplified model in flows with dominating dissociation may yield overestimated dissociation rate. In the hypersonic flow along the stagnation line, the influence of asymmetric vibrations on the fluid dynamics and heat transfer is weak; the main role belongs to chemical reactions and VT transitions in the bending mode. In this case, the computationally efficient simplified model can be used to predict macroscopic variables and heat flux without significant loss of accuracy.},

On the other hand, the choice of thermal equilibrium Arrhenius law parameters is crucial for the correct prediction of rate coefficients for both reactions. Developed models are implemented to the one-dimensional boundary layer code for coupled state-to-state simulations of nonequilibrium CO<sub>2</sub> flows under Mars entry conditions. Vibrational distributions, mixture composition, flow variables, and heat flux are studied for several kinetic schemes and different models of chemical reactions. Whereas including the exchange reactions weakly affects the flow, switching between the Park and McKenzie sets of parameters results in significant modification of the kinetic mechanisms; for the McKenzie model, recombination near the wall is a dominating reaction, whereas for the Park model, chemical reactions are frozen. Different contributions to the heat flux are evaluated and a satisfactory agreement with experiments is shown.},

For reaction rate coefficients, the agreement with experimental and theoretical data in the literature is excellent on the whole available interval 300-5000 K, with reliable extension to 20,000 K. For the inelastic case and for dissociation, no comparisons are available; therefore, a study of QCT reliability is proposed. In the inelastic case, it is found that "purely inelastic" and "quasireactive" collisions show not only different mechanisms but also different QCT levels of reliability at low energy. For dissociation, similar considerations bring to the conclusion that for the present collisional system, the QCT method is appropriate on the whole energy range studied.

These rates have been implemented in a N2/N/O2/O/NO mixture state-to-state kinetic model. The model has been tested in a couple of applications. The first consists in its time evolution, for 10−3 s, from an equilibrium composition at 4000/3000 K towards a new composition obtained by suddenly decreasing the temperature to 1000 K. This is a preliminary study that could open the way to a new approach in the investigation of some biomedical applications governed by plasma sources at atmospheric pressure. The second test regards the boundary layer formed around the nose of a hypersonic vehicle in the framework of the fast transportation and space tourism applications.},

@article{pub.1140815848,
 abstract = {Numerous applications have required the study of CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ plasmas since the 1960s, from CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ lasers to spacecraft heat shields. However, in recent years, intense research activities on the subject have restarted because of environmental problems associated with CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ emissions. The present review provides a synthesis of the current state of knowledge on the physical chemistry of cold CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ plasmas. In particular, the different modeling approaches implemented to address specific aspects of CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ plasmas are presented. Throughout the paper, the importance of conducting joint experimental, theoretical and modeling studies to elucidate the complex couplings at play in CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ plasmas is emphasized. Therefore, the experimental data that are likely to bring relevant constraints to the different modeling approaches are first reviewed. Second, the calculation of some key elementary processes obtained with semi-empirical, classical and quantum methods is presented. In order to describe the electron kinetics, the latest coherent sets of cross section satisfying the constraints of “electron swarm” analyses are introduced, and the need for self-consistent calculations for determining accurate electron energy distribution function (EEDF) is evidenced. The main findings of the latest zero-dimensional (0D) global models about the complex chemistry of CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ and its dissociation products in different plasma discharges are then given, and full state-to-state (STS) models of only the vibrational-dissociation kinetics developed for studies of spacecraft shields are described. Finally, two important points for all applications using CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ containing plasma are discussed: the role of surfaces in contact with the plasma, and the need for 2D/3D models to capture the main features of complex reactor geometries including effects induced by fluid dynamics on the plasma properties. In addition to bringing together the latest advances in the description of CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ non-equilibrium plasmas, the results presented here also highlight the fundamental data that are still missing and the possible routes that still need to be investigated.Graphic abstract},

 abstract = {Nonequilibrium nitrogen dissociation-recombination kinetics in the boundary layer and on the surface of a solid body during hypersonic flow. the subsequent relaxation of the released energy, and their influence on the surface heat flux have been investigated by numerical simulations. It is shown that the homogeneous (in the gas phase) and heterogeneous (on the surface) recombination energy of nitrogen atoms is transferred to the vibrational degrees of freedom. Strongly nonequilibrium vibrational distributions of nitrogen molecules are formed with strong influences on the boundary layer chemistry and the surface heat flux. These effects seem to be of significant importance for the reentry of vehicles such as the Space Shuttle as well as for typical problems met in plasma chemistry.},

 abstract = {Starting from an equilibrium initial condition at 3000 K, the non-equilibrium vibrational kinetics of a 500 K atmospheric pressure N2/N/O2/O/NO mixture is investigated with a zero-dimensional time-dependent numerical solver. Attention is devoted to the O + N2(v) and N + O2(v) collisions, thanks to new QCT state-to-state rates from the literature. The Zeldovich and the dissociation–recombination reactions are considered; for the N + O2(v) collisions the inelastic vT processes are considered too. Interpolation formulae of the corresponding rates are proposed. The mixture behaviour depends on the combined effects of the different processes, however under the conditions adopted the forward second Zeldovich reaction switches on the kinetics towards a new equilibrium. The aim of the present study is to open the door to more complex applications of plasmas in the fields of the plasma medicine, the fertilizers production and, more in general, of the nitrogen fixation.},

 abstract = {In this study, we develop and assess a new approach to modeling slip boundary conditions in gas mixtures with coupled state-to-state vibrational-chemical kinetics and surface physical and chemical processes: adsorption, desorption, vibrational energy transitions, and chemical reactions. Expressions for velocity slip, temperature jump, and mass fluxes of species are derived on the basis of the advanced kinetic boundary condition taking into account gain and loss of particles in surface processes; theoretical expressions for the mass fluxes obtained in the frame of various approaches are compared. The developed model is implemented to the fluid-dynamic solver for modeling dynamics and state-to-state air kinetics in the boundary layer near stagnation point. Several test cases corresponding to a various degree of gas rarefaction are considered. Recombination probabilities and effective reaction rates are calculated and compared to recent molecular-dynamic simulations; the proposed model yields the best agreement for the recombination rate coefficient. It is shown that temperature jump significantly affects fluid-dynamic parameters and surface heat flux; the role of heterogeneous reactions on the silica surface is weaker. In the surface heating, there is a competition between these two effects: whereas the temperature jump reduces the wall heat flux, surface reactions cause its increase, but to a lesser extent. It is concluded that the model proposed in this study describes self-consistently detailed vibrational kinetics, rarefaction effects, and surface reactions and can be applied both in continuum and slip flow regimes.},
