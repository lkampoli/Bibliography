 abstract = {An approach based on a Discontinuous Galerkin discretisation is proposed for the Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook model kinetic equation. This approach allows for a high-order polynomial approximation of molecular velocity distribution function both in spatial and velocity variables. It is applied to model one-dimensional normal shock wave and heat transfer problems. Convergence of solutions with respect to the number of spatial cells and velocity bins is studied, with the degree of polynomial approximation ranging from zero to four in the physical space variable and from zero to eight in the velocity variable. This approach is found to conserve mass, momentum and energy when high-degree polynomial approximations are used in the velocity space. For the shock wave problem, the solution is shown to exhibit accelerated convergence with respect to the velocity variable. Convergence with respect to the spatial variable is in agreement with the order of the polynomial approximation used. For the heat transfer problem, it was observed that convergence of solutions obtained by high-degree polynomial approximations is only second order with respect to the resolution in the spatial variable. This is attributed to the temperature jump at the wall in the solutions. The shock wave and heat transfer solutions are in excellent agreement with the solutions obtained by a conservative finite volume scheme.},

The comparison of computed size distributions and experimental data shows satisfactory agreement, especially for (H2O)n clusters with n larger than 50.

@article{pub.1013183872,
 abstract = {Modeling results of volcanic plumes on Jupiter’s moon Io are presented. Two types of low density axisymmetric SO2 plume flows are modeled using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. Thermal radiation from all three vibrational bands and overall rotational lines of SO2 molecules is modeled. A high resolution computation of the flow in the vicinity of the vent was obtained by multidomain sequential calculation to improve the modeling of the radiation signature. The radiation features are examined both by calculating infrared emission spectra along different lines-of-sight through the plume and with the DSMC modeled emission images of the whole flow field. It is found that most of the radiation originates in the vicinity of the vent, and non-LTE (non-local-thermodynamic equilibrium) cooling by SO2 rotation lines exceeds cooling in the v2 vibrational band at high altitude.In addition to the general shape of the plumes, the calculated average SO2 column density (∼1016 cm−2) over a Pele-type plume and the related frost-deposition ring structure (at R ∼ 500 km from the vent) are in agreement with observations. These comparisons partially validate the modeling. It is suggested that an observation with spatial resolution of less than 30 km is needed to measure the large spatial variation of SO2 near a Pele-type plume center. It is also found that an influx of 1.1 × 1029 SO2 s−1 (or 1.1 × 104 kg s−1) is sufficient to reproduce the observed SO2 column density at Pele. The simulation results also show some interesting features such as a multiple bounce shock structure around Prometheus-type plumes and the frost depletion by plume-induced erosion on the sunlit side of Io. The model predicts the existence of a canopy shock, a ballistic region inside the Pele-type plume, and the negligible effect of surface heating by plume emission.},

 abstract = {The ability of a chirped pulsed optical lattice to create diamond films using a molecular beam of fullerene molecules is numerically investigated. Two cases, high and low density, are considered. In both cases, the molecular beam was found to impact the substrate at velocities between 10 and 14km/s. The proposed scenario for the diamond coating stems from the generation of high velocity beams of fullerene particles, bombardment of the substrate surface by these beams, successive dissipation of kinetic energy at the surface and drastic increase of pressure and temperature in the interaction region and finally, formation of diamond crystal structure from deposited fullerenes. A possible setup for the film deposition is proposed. It is shown that that such a system could possibly achieve diamond film growth rates in excess of 1.4mm/s.},

In all cases, direct comparison of the experimental data and the predictions from DSMC showed excellent agreement, with only minor deviations which, in most cases, can be ascribed to either the inherent uncertainty in the MTV or small uncertainties in the measured wall pressures.},

 abstract = {Many of the major scientists of the late 19th and early 20th century have weighed in on the mechanisms that influence the forces produced in the Crookes radiometer. However, even today, there is still some uncertainty, and in fact confusion, about the order of magnitudes of forces produced by these mechanisms and the dominant mechanisms in various operational regimes and configurations. The development of a better understanding of the radiometric force, aimed at resolving that confusion, has been helped by modern computational techniques. In the transitional flow regime, where the radiometric force is observed, kinetic approaches are necessary for valid results. These modern kinetic approaches, coupled with significant increases in computational speed, have qualitatively improved the level of understanding of radiometric flows. For the first time, flowfields near the vanes of a radiometer can be fully investigated in an attempt to quantify the importance of various mechanisms involved in the production of the radiometric force. In many cases, the computational techniques have been validated by highly accurate experiments. Various operational regimes and geometric configurations have been studied in an attempt to maximize the force. This review looks at the historic context of three types of radiometers, most notably the Crookes radiometer, develops a modern understanding of the mechanisms behind the radiometric force, and documents recent applications.},

 abstract = {Gas and ion transport in the capillary-skimmer subatmospheric interface of a mass spectrometer, which is typically utilized to separate unevaporated micro-droplets from ions, was studied numerically using a two-step approach spanning multiple gas dynamic regimes. The gas flow in the heated capillary and in the interface was determined by solving numerically the Navier-Stokes equation. The capillary-to-skimmer gas/ion flow was modeled through the solution of the full Boltzmann equation with a force term. The force term, together with calculated aerodynamic drag, determined the ion motion in the gap between the capillary and skimmer. Three-dimensional modeling of the impact of the voltage applied to the Einzel lens on the transmission of doubly charged peptide ions through the skimmer orifice was compared with experimental data obtained in the companion study. Good agreement between measured and computed signals was observed. The numerical results indicate that as many as 75% of the ions that exit from the capillary are lost on the conical surface of the skimmer or capillary outer surface because of the electrostatic force and plume divergence.Figureᅟ},

 abstract = {This paper presents an overview of our recent theoretical and experimental work investigating the application of deep, periodic optical dipole potentials (optical lattices) produced by intense pulsed optical fields for the transport of neutral molecular gases. Our review outlines the deceleration of molecules in a molecular beam to create slow cold molecules and also acceleration for production of hyperthermal molecular beams with velocities in excess of 10 km/s for material processing. We describe how bulk motion can be induced in a gas by a traveling optical lattice, even when the gas is not fully trapped by the lattice. In all these cases energy and momentum can be deposited from laser radiation that is not resonant with any internal states. When significant numbers of gas collisions occur during the lattice/laser pulse, gas heating accompanied by the formation of gas jets in free space and bulk drift in a capillary can be induced. Finally, we describe a new nonintrusive laser diagnostic method for measurement of gas properties based on analysis of light scattered from density perturbations induced by lattices.},

The numerical solutions were obtained using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method and a discrete ordinate method for the ellipsoidal statistical and Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook models. The Knudsen number was 0.2 and the length-to-height ratio 5. Three different wall temperature distributions were considered: linear, step-wise, and a non-monotonic profile typical for a radiantly heated Knudsen Compressor's membrane. The short channel end effects are characterized, and the sensitivity of the mass flow to a non-monotonic temperature distribution is shown.},

 abstract = {Validation of three direct simulation Monte Carlo chemistry models—total collision energy, Quantum Kinetic, and Kuznetsov state specific (KSS)—is conducted through the comparison of calculated vibrational temperatures of molecular oxygen with measured values inside a normal shock wave. First, the 2D geometry and numerical approach used to simulate the shock experiments is verified. Next, two different vibrational relaxation models are validated by comparison with data for the M = 9.3 case where dissociation is small in the nonequilibrium region of the shock and with newly obtained thermal rates. Finally, the three chemistry model results are compared for M = 9.3 and 13.4 in the region where the vibrational temperature is greatly different from the rotational and translational temperature, and thus nonequilibrium dissociation is important. It is shown that the peak vibrational temperature is very sensitive to the initial nonequilibrium rate of reaction in the chemistry model and that the vibrationally favored KSS model is much closer to the measured peak, but the post-peak behavior indicates that some details of the model still need improvement.},

A continuum approach based on the solution of the Navier–Stokes equations is applied to model the gas flow through a capillary connecting the atmospheric and subatmospheric sections of a mass spectrometer. A microscopic, fully kinetic approach based on the solution of the Boltzmann equation is used to examine the ion and gas transport through an ion-funnel kept at a 0.1–3 Torr pressure to the quadrupole section kept at a 0.01 Torr pressure. In addition to aerodynamic drag, the developed approach takes into account the combined effect of the DC field driving the ions downstream toward the funnel exit, the rf field confining the ions in radial direction, and the space charge causing ion repulsion. The sensitivity of the ion transmission to the gas pressure in the ion-funnel, the rf, and the total ion current injected to the funnel from capillary nozzle is shown.Graphical Abstractᅟ},

 abstract = {The total desolvation rate of sample droplets in an argon inductively coupled plasma (Ar ICP) is investigated through the development of a two-phase continuum flow computer model. The desolvation model is supplemented by equations used to determine the trajectories of particles through the plasma. The model is used to calculate the behavior of aerosol droplets from a direct injection high efficiency nebulizer (DIHEN), a micronebulizer used to inject microliter quantities of samples that are toxic, expensive, or of limited volume. We use the combination of desolvation and transport models to present the first predicted spatial distribution of droplet concentrations and evaporation rates in an ICP flow. These data are compared with the behavior of a DIHEN spray in an environment with no net argon gas flow to determine the importance of gas flow rates to overall droplet concentration profiles in the ICP. In addition, two separate techniques (Stokes’ equation and the direct simulation Monte Carlo treatment) for determining droplet trajectories are contrasted.},

The model includes a planar flow between a field-reversed configuration plasmoid initially at a Schmid–Burgk equilibrium and neutral gas with varying relative velocities, plasma temperatures, and neutral gas densities. The contribution of charge exchange, electron impact ionization reactions, and collisional radiation is analyzed, and the sensitivity of the entrainment efficiency to the plasmoid translation velocity and neutral density is evaluated.},

 abstract = {A numerical model is developed to consider for the first time droplet coalescence along with transport, heating and desolvation in an argon inductively coupled plasma (Ar ICP). The direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method and the Ashgriz–Poo model are used, respectively, to compute droplet–droplet interactions and to determine the outcome of droplet collisions. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations support the use of the Ashgriz–Poo coalescence model for small droplet coalescence. Simulations predict spatial maps of droplet number and mass densities within an Ar ICP for a conventional nebulizer-spray chamber arrangement, a direct injection high efficiency nebulizer (DIHEN), and a large bore DIHEN (LB-DIHEN). The primary findings are: (1) even at 1500 W, the collisions of the droplets in the plasma lead primarily to coalescence, particularly for direct aerosol injection; (2) the importance of coalescence in a spray simulation exhibits a complex relationship with the gas temperature and droplet size; (3) DIHEN droplets penetrate further into the Ar ICP when coalescence is considered; and (4) droplets from a spray chamber or the LB-DIHEN coalesce less frequently than those from a DIHEN. The implications of these predictions in spectrochemical analysis in ICP spectrometry are discussed.},

Size scaling with matching Knudsen numbers makes the results applicable to microscale particles such as aerosol droplets at atmospheric pressure. Two sets of measurements are presented. The first set, complemented by numerical modelling based on the solution of the ellipsoidal statistical Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook kinetic equation, is focused on a spherical particle of high thermal conductivity in close proximity to a heated wall. The second set is conducted for the same particle placed in a linear thermal gradient established between two parallel walls. Results show the first reproducible measurements of negative thermophoretic force acting on a spherical particle in the direction from cold to hot, with values of the order of 5 % of the maximum hot to cold force production. },

The radiometric force is then measured on a nano-Newton thrust stand in a 3 m vacuum chamber and compared with the present numerical predictions and analytical predictions proposed by various authors. The computational modelling is conducted with a kinetic approach based on the solution of ellipsoidal statistical Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (ES-BGK) equation. Numerical modelling showed the importance of regions with elevated pressure observed near the edges of the vane for the radiometric force production. A simple empirical expression is proposed for the radiometric force as a function of pressure that is found to be in good agreement with the experimental data. The shear force on the lateral side of the vane was found to decrease the total radiometric force.},

 abstract = {Abstract A numerical and experimental study of radiometric forces on vanes of different thickness is presented for the flow regime where the radiometric force is near its maximum. For single- and multi-vane geometries, it is shown that radiometric force decreases by only ∼10–15 % when the vane thickness-to-height ratio increases fourfold from 0.5 to 2. For a single-vane geometry, the shear force on the lateral side of the vane is attributed to a vortex flow generated by the interaction of cold chamber walls and heated walls of the vane. In that case, it always acts to reduce the total radiometric force governed by the pressure difference between the hot and the cold sides of the vane. For a multi-vane geometry, represented by a perforated vane, the shear force becomes positive for larger thickness-to-height ratios and lower pressures, primarily due to strong vane-driven transpiration flow through the gaps.},

These flows are a basic and often important element of various modern gas driven instruments. Recent advances in micro- and nanoscale technologies have paved the way for a generation of miniaturized devices in various application areas, from clinical analyses to biochemical detection to aerospace propulsion. The latter is the main area of interest of this study, where rarefied gas flow into a vacuum through short tubes with thickness-to-diameter ratios varying from 0.015 to 1.2 is investigated both experimentally and numerically with kinetic and continuum approaches. Helium and nitrogen gases are used in the range of Reynolds numbers from 0.02 to 770 (based on the tube diameter), corresponding to Knudsen numbers from 40 down to about 0.001. Propulsion properties of relatively thin and thick tubes are examined. Good agreement between experimental and numerical results is observed for mass flow rate and momentum flux, the latter being corrected for the experimental facility background pressure. For thick-to-thin tube ratios of mass flow and momentum flux versus pressure, a minimum is observed at a Knudsen number of about 0.5. A short tube propulsion efficiency is shown to be much higher than that of a thin orifice. The effect of surface specularity on a thicker tube specific impulse was found to be relatively small.},

To efficiently simulate gas-surface interaction, molecular collisions with the actual rough surface are simulated by collisions with a randomly positioned conical hole having a fixed opening angle. This model requires only one surface parameter, average surface roughness angle. This model has also been linked to the Cercignani-Lampis scattering kernel as a required reference for use in deterministic kinetic solvers. Experiments were conducted on transitional flows through a 150μm tall, 1cm wide, 1.5cm long microchannel where the mean free path is on the order of the roughness size. The channel walls were made of silicon with: (i) polished smooth surfaces, (ii) regular triangular roughness, and (iii) regular square roughness with characteristic roughness scales of <1μm, 11μm, and 29μm, respectively. For the triangular roughness, mass flow reductions ranged from 6% at the higher stagnation pressures tested to 25% at the lower stagnation pressures tested when compared to the smooth channel.},

The approach is based on the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, extended as appropriate to include the most important processes of cluster nucleation and evolution at the microscopic level. The approach uses a recombination-reaction energy-dependent mechanism of the DSMC method for the characterization of dimer formation, and the RRK model for the cluster evaporation. Three-step testing and validation of the model is conducted by (i) comparison of clusterization rates in an equilibrium heat bath with theoretical predictions for argon and water vapor and adjustment of the model parameters, (ii) comparison of the nonequilibrium argon cluster size distributions with experimental data, and (iii) comparison of the nonequilibrium water cluster size distributions with experimental measurements. Reasonable agreement was observed for all three parts of the validation.},

A continuum, Euler/Navier-Stokes solver versatile advection code is used to model the gas transport, and a kinetic particle solver is developed in this work to simulate cluster nucleation and growth. Parameters in the new model were adjusted so as to match the known theoretical dimer formation equilibrium constants for the two gases under consideration, argon and water. Reasonable agreement between computed and available experimental data was found in terminal cluster size distributions for nozzle water expansions in a wide range of stagnation pressures.

The deviation indicates a trend, as a function of lattice velocity, similar to that relating to previously published energy and momentum transfer calculations for high-intensity lattices. Furthermore, the deviation indicates a maximum intensity at which current CRBS theory is valid.},

One of the key advantages of the discussed facility is that in a single system and a single experiment, it combines the tools for the activation of transient and steady-state supersonic flow with self-sustaining or nonself-sustaining discharge, and flow analysis using electron-beam spectroscopy and molecular-beam mass spectroscopy. Dry roughing and high-vacuum pumps enable accurate diagnostics of chemically reacting processes in virtually any gas mixture, including hydrocarbons. A pulsed flow regime controlled by developed in-house fast valves provides an efficient way to examine quasi-stationary flows at fairly high flow rates, with significant material and energy savings. The facility serves a number of purposes, from cluster-surface interaction studies with thin film and surface structure formation, to high-pressure jet expansions that emulate spacecraft nozzles at high altitudes, to technological process development, primarily focused on hydrocarbons.

Low Reynolds number flows of helium and nitrogen through a small conical nozzle and a thin-walled orifice have been investigated both numerically, using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo technique, and experimentally, using a nano-Newton thrust stand. For throat Reynolds number less than 100, the nozzle to orifice thrust ratio is less than unity; however, the corresponding ratio of specific impulse remains greater than one for the Reynolds number range from 0.02 to 200. Once the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo model results were verified using experimental thrust and mass flow data, the model was used to investigate the effects of geometrical variations on the conical nozzle's performance. At low Reynolds numbers, improvements to the specific impulse on the order of 4 to 8% were achieved through a combination of decreasing the nozzle length and increasing the nozzle expansion angle relative to the nominal experimental geometry.},

It develops, applies, and validates kinetic and molecular-level models of improved physical realism for nonequilibrium processes such as collisional interaction of gases, gas-particulate mixtures, and gas surface interaction that arise in high temperature, multi-species, chemically reacting rarefied flowfields such as rocket plumes. These phenomena are not accurately addressed by standard engineering tools and require improved understanding of the basic physics. A number of closely related research issues arise in the area of rarefied flows on the micro length scales, including micropropulsion flows. The key computational tool used in this effort is the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method and related kinetic solvers. Recently, a 3D multi-phase DSMC capability has been developed and applied to study the interaction of solid propellant plumes with rarefied atmosphere. A parallel 3D Monte Carlo numerical tool for modeling radiation in multi-phase flows has been developed; the integration of fluid and radiation tools is planned in the future. New optical micropropulsion concepts have been formulated based on non-resonant interaction of optical lattice and carrier gas. Spacecraft contamination effects have been studied, and efficient numerical models for surface roughness were proposed.},

The range of pressures investigated is broad enough to observe the impact of the chamber walls on a given radiometer configuration in both the free molecule and transitional regimes. The contribution of the chamber walls to both the flowfield structure and radiometric force production were examined for helium, argon, and nitrogen test gases. Various radiometer geometries were experimentally tested on a force balance, with nano- Newton resolution, placed in a stagnant gas. The computational results were obtained using the solution of the model kinetic equations and by the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. The simulations compliment the experimental work by varying the chamber dimensions to a degree not practically attainable, demonstrating both the decreasing temperature gradient of the flowfield and the reduced force production of the radiometer as the physical dimensions of the chamber increase. It is concluded that chamber wall location has a dramatic effect on the force production of a radiometer, especially at higher pressures, where increasing the distance from the vane to the wall reduces both temperature gradient and the total force produced.},

@article{pub.1091586381,
 abstract = {One of the most important issues in CFD modeling of ablation process is the formulation of boundary conditions at the gas-surface interface. These boundary conditions cannot be obtained without analytical or parametric numerical modeling of the Knudsen layer formed near the evaporating surface. Analytical models are therefore of interest for numerical simulation of ablating flows. Recently Pekker, Keidar, and Cambier developed a new analytical model of the Knudsen layer, which takes into account the temperature gradient in the bulk gas. This model uses a bimodal velocity distribution function which preserves the laws of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy within the Knudsen layer and converges to the Chapman-Enskog velocity distribution function at the outer boundary of the Knudsen layer. The main objective of this work is to provide detailed analysis of the applicability of this analytical model of the Knudsen layer through comparison of results with the numerical solutions of the ES-BGK model kinetic equation and DSMC results.},

The numerical results were compared with experiments conducted in the HET facility for a high-enthalpy pure nitrogen flow corresponding to a free stream Mach number of approximately seven. Since the conditions for the double wedge case are near-continuum and surface heat flux and size of the separation are sensitive to DSMC numerical parameters, special attention was paid to the convergence of these parameters for both geometries. At the beginning of the simulation, the separation zone was predicted to be small and the heat flux values for the 2-D model were comparable to the experimental data. However, for increasing time, it was observed that the heat flux values and shock profile strongly deviated from the experiment. Investigation of a three-dimensional model showed that the flow is truly three-dimensional and the side edge pressure relief provides good agreement between simulations and the experiment.},

 abstract = {Spacecraft contamination has long been a subject of study in the rarefied gas dynamics community. Professor Mikhail Ivanov coined the term a spacecraft's "own ambient environment" to describe the effects of natural and satellite driven processes on the conditions encountered by a spacecraft in orbit. Outgassing, thruster firings, and gas and liquid dumps all contribute to the spacecraft's contamination environment. Rarefied gas dynamic modeling techniques, such as Direct Simulation Monte Carlo, are well suited to investigate these spacebased environments. However, many advances were necessary to fully characterize the extent of this problem. A better understanding of modeling flows over large pressure ranges, for example hybrid continuum and rarefied numerical schemes, were required. Two-phase flow modeling under rarefied conditions was necessary. And the ability to model plasma flows for a new era of propulsion systems was also required. Through the work of Professor Ivanov and his team, we now have a better understanding of processes that create a spacecraft's own ambient environment and are able to better characterize these environments. Advances in numerical simulation have also spurred on the development of experimental facilities to study these effects. The relationship between numerical results and experimental advances will be explored in this manuscript.},

Resultant translational gas temperatures, as well as induced bulk velocities, were used quantify energy and momentum deposition. To maximize available gas temperature changes achieved using the technique, laser pulses were linearly chirped to produce lattice velocities able to more effectively facilitate energy deposition throughout the pulse duration. From the initial conditions, the maximum, end pulse axial translational temperature obtained in nitrogen was approximately 755 K, at a lattice velocity of 400 m/s linearly chirped at 25 Gm/s2 over the 40 ns pulse duration.

Qualitative agreement between the numerical and experimental results is shown as a function of operating Knudsen number, vane separation distance, and surrounding chamber geometry. Both sets of results indicate an asymptotic trend in maximum force as the separation distance increases as well as a shift in the maximum force Knudsen number. Small chamber effects for both numerical and experimental results indicate an increase of the total force ranging from a factor of 2.5 to 4. Quantitatively, however, the numerical simulations yield forces approximately an order of magnitude higher than observed in the experiments due to differences in carrier gas and accommodation coefficient as well as the two dimensional nature of the numerical simulations versus the three dimensional experiment.},

Realizing this integration would greatly enhance the scaling of laser‐species interactions beyond the realm of ultra‐cold atomic physics. A representative numerical investigation was conducted using a custom collisionless gas particle trajectory code, demonstrating this goal in the present study. The investigation covered neutral atomic beam steering and collimation using near‐resonant laser fields. In addition to the numerical investigation, a validating experiment was conducted. The experimental results showed good agreement with the numerical simulations when experimental parameters, such as finite laser line width, were taken into account. These simulations showed trends and some limitations associated with the use of a continuous‐wave Gaussian laser fields for the steering and collimation of a geometrically skimmed cesium atomic beam using the photon scattering force and the near‐resonant induced dipole gradient force. These simulations indicate possible integration of the resonant laser‐atom interaction with other rarefied and collisional solvers for similar species such as alkali metals.},

Finally, the 3 DSMC chemistry model results are compared for the M=13.4 case where nonequilbrium dissociation (in the region where the vibrational temperature is greatly different from the rotational and translational temperature) is important. It is shown that the peak vibrational temperature is very sensitive to vibrational favoring in the chemistry model and that the vibrationally-favored KSS model predicts the measured peak quite well.},

 abstract = {The force that acts on a thin vane immersed in rarefied gas when a temperature gradient is imposed along or across the vane has historically been known as the Radiometric force. First observed by Fresnel in 1825, the radiometric force has regained its former popularity in recent decades due to the advent of micro-machines, where a transitional flow regime can occur at atmospheric pressures. Whether used for its force potential or simply viewed as a nuisance, this force cannot be ignored in micro-devices where thermal gradients exist. Potential applications of radiometric force now span from atomic force microscopy to astrophysics to high altitude flight. This paper describes an application of these forces to a conceptual micro-scale energy harvester, where two possible geometries of operation are described. It is shown that one configuration is significantly simpler to fabricate while the other geometry is more efficient at producing larger forces. The effect of pressure, feature separation, and feature-to-ring gap are analyzed. For consistency and the accurate treatment of the relevant flow conditions, an implementation of the SMOKE code that solves the ES BGK equation was used in all computations.},

An attempt is made to take into account the fast vibrational relaxation of nitrogen through V-V exchange with oxygen by increasing the vibration-translation relaxation rate by a constant factor. The results have shown that such an approach still significantly overpredicts the available N2/O2 relaxation times. Then, a new approach to account for V-V exchanges is proposed, which incorporates the calculation of near-resonant transitions according to a temperature-dependent probability calibrated with available experimental data. That approach was found to provide quantitative agreement with shock tube measurements of vibrational relaxation in N2–O2 mixtures. While targeting primarily high-temperature air flows, the approach is applicable to any flow where the VV energy transfer needs to be modeled. It provides the benefits of numerical efficiency, simplicity of implementation, and acceptable physical accuracy.},

Variation of the freestream flow density and velocity has shown that the gas recombination (mostly from nitrogen atoms) dominates at Knudsen numbers of 0.001 and lower and velocities of 6 km/s and higher; the surface recombination is more important otherwise. The increase in the heat flux due to the gas recombination is extremely sensitive to the wall is important for temperatures of about or lower than 1000 K.

A number of attempts by computational fluid dynamics modelers to reproduce the published results were unsuccessful in predicting the peak vibrational temperature, the downstream slope, or both. Our recent analysis has shown that some of the assumptions used in spectra-to-temperature conversions, such as the two-temperature approximation, are violated in the early region of the shock, and a more detailed analysis and direct comparison of UV absorption, and not temperatures, is necessary. This work presents such an analysis where a gas number density, translational temperature, and distribution of rotational and vibrational level populations, obtained using a kinetic gas dynamic approach, are converted into UV in-band absorption for each temporal or spatial location in the shock using a detailed spectroscopic model. The computed UV absorption is then directly compared with the raw measured time-dependent UV absorption curves at several wavelengths. Such a comparison is shown to have more validity than the previous ones.},

The unimolecular dissociation of water is used to calculate the probability of reaction as well as determine the product OH translational, vibrational, and rotational energy distributions. The molecular dynamics probabilities of reactions and product distributions are used in the direct simulation Monte Carlo method to model spatial distribution and temperatures of OH in the bow-shock of a 5 km/sec vehicle at 80 and 100 km. Ultraviolet spectra of the OH(X→A) transition are computed and compared with data from the Bow Shock Ultraviolet Flight Experiment 2. Excellent agreement of the spectral features between theory and experiment is obtained.},

The Reynolds number range investigated in this study is from 0.5 to approximately 900 using helium and nitrogen propellants. The thrust produced by the nozzle was first assessed on a force balance to provide a baseline case. Subsequently, an aluminum plate was attached to the same force balance at various angles from 0° (parallel to the plume flow) to 10°. For low Reynolds number helium flow, a 16.5% decrease in thrust was measured for the plate at 0° relative to the free plume expansion case.

 abstract = {Several distinct modeling approaches are tested for their ability to resolve translational non‐equilibrium phenomena that are common to, but not unique to, rarefied gas dynamic flowfields. The methods considered include DSMC, BGK, ES‐BGK, Navier‐Stokes, and 7‐moment (anisotropic) and 20‐moment solutions of the Boltzmann equation for a Maxwell gas. For the high Mach number normal shock wave, ES‐BGK shows fair‐to‐good agreement with DSMC, while numerical solution of the 7‐moment model equations are rather poor. The 20‐moment solution compares rather well with those DSMC results, suggesting that some intermediate level (or problem‐dependent) moment equation set may indeed be quantitatively useful for modeling translational non‐equilibrium. For the hypersonic sphere‐cone flowfield, comparison of the directly sampled shear stress with the Navier‐Stokes and 7‐moment values evaluated using the DSMC macroscopic properties shows that the anisotropic model offers qualitative improvement over the NS model over a broad range of rarefaction.},

These errors are mainly due to deficiencies in extrapolating low energy (<1 eV) Variable Hard‐Sphere (VHS) and Variable Soft‐Sphere (VSS) collision models to hyperthermal collision energies (>1 eV) important in plume modeling. The VHS and VSS scattering treatments are based on repulsive inverse‐power‐law inter‐particle potential energy functions, which are not adequate at hyperthermal energies. In this work, we integrate the more physically realistic and accurate repulsive Born‐Mayer exponential‐interaction potential into the DSMC framework. We introduce the new Extended Variable Hard‐Sphere (EVHS) and Extended Variable Soft‐Sphere (EVSS) collision models, which significantly improve DSMC modeling at hyperthermal energies without an added computational penalty. Comparisons between VHS and EVHS modeling and data for argon over a range of energies and high altitude plume radiance data demonstrate the validity of the new treatment.},

The computational results were obtained through 2‐D simulations using the direct simulation Monte Carlo method, as well as a discrete ordinate solution of the ES model kinetic equation. Gas pressure was varied from 0.006 to 6 Pa, which was a broad enough range to observe the characteristic peak force production of a radiometer in the transition regime, where the peak occurs at Kn ∼0.1. It was found that the area of a radiometer vane is responsible for a significant amount of the total force production through a wide range of operating pressures. It is only at the highest background pressures, well after force production has peaked, that the vane perimeter appears to dominate the operation of the radiometer.},

The range of pressures investigated is broad enough to observe the impact of the chamber walls on a given radiometer configuration in both the free molecule and transitional regimes. The contribution of the chamber walls to both the flowfield structure and radiometric force production were examined for helium, argon, and nitrogen test gases. Various radiometer geometries were experimentally tested on a force balance with nano‐Newton resolution placed in a stagnant gas. The computational results were obtained using the solution of the model kinetic equations and by the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. The simulations compliment the experimental work by varying the chamber dimensions to a degree not practically attainable, demonstrating both the decreasing temperature gradient of the flowfield and the reduced force production of the radiometer as the physical dimensions of the chamber increase. It is concluded that chamber wall location has a dramatic effect on the force production of a radiometer, especially at higher pressures, where increasing the distance from the vane to the wall reduces both temperature gradient and the total force produced.},

 abstract = {The modeling of the thermodynamic nonequilibrium state of the gas in continuum and rarefied regimes for hypervelocity flight requires appropriate modeling of translational and internal energy modes of molecules in the gas. Assumptions of equilibrium in the energy states along with simplified relaxation and dissociation models are restricted to certain flow regimes and conditions. In others it is necessary to model the translational nonequilibrium using higher moments of the Boltzmann equation and the internal energy modes modeled with state‐kinetic rates. The internal energy mode addressed in this paper are the transitions between the quantum levels in the vibrational energy mode and state‐specific dissociation from the vibrational quantum levels. The paper describes recent advances made in solving the Boltzmann equation in the rarefied regime and a gas kinetic scheme in the continuum regime, thus facilitating coupling by the use of the distribution function. The paper also describes recent advances in the modeling of internal energy relaxation involving multiquantum transitions in vibrational mode and state‐to‐state kinetics of dissociation.

The one‐dimensional lattices were formed by two 100 ps, 393 mJ, 532 nm, simulated laser pulses and assumed to be far from resonance. The maximum centerline temperature was simulated as a function of the intervening time between pulses. An optimum intervening time was found and related to the mean collision time and available energy modes. Subsequent pulses can act to cool the gas for intervening times near zero. For long intervening times, thermal diffusion carries energy away from the centerline, reducing the maximum temperature. At one atmosphere the optimal intervening time was found to be 0.7, 1.0 and 0.25 ns for argon, nitrogen, and methane respectively. The highest temperature simulated for nitrogen was 2480 K after 50 pulses with an optimal intervening time.

 abstract = {An approach based on the direct simulation Monte Carlo method is proposed to model a core flow in a converging–diverging nozzle. The area of applicability of this approach is defined by the Boltzmann equation, which allows fully kinetic models that accurately capture thermal and chemical nonequilibrium to be applied to gas flows where the flow regime rapidly changes from continuum to transitional. The approach is validated through comparison with available experimental data. The examination of nonequilibrium and reaction rate effects for Caltech's T5 shock tunnel condition has shown little impact of nonequilibrium but demonstrated significant sensitivity of nitric oxide (NO) density to all exchange reaction and NO recombination rates. The use of the most recent theoretical and experimental rates results in a factor of two lower NO density at the nozzle exit as compared to the conventional Park rates, which indicates that re-visiting of the latter may be necessary. Multi-parametric sensitivity study of T5 conditions has not provided an explanation for a large drop in free-stream temperature and NO density over time, under constant flow velocity, observed recently in T5. Modeling of High Enthalpy Shock Tunnel Göttingen conditions has demonstrated considerable nonequilibrium between vibrational modes of N2, NO, and O2; it has also shown that the vibration–dissociation coupling strongly influences mole fractions of NO and O2.},
