 abstract = {A closed self-consistent description of a one-temperature non-equilibrium reacting flow is presented on the basis of the kinetic theory methods. A general case including internal degrees of freedom, dissociation–recombination and exchange reactions, and arbitrary values of affinities of chemical reactions is considered. Chemical-reaction rates and mean normal stress in viscous compressible flows are studied and a symmetric cross coupling between these terms is found. It is shown that the rate of each chemical reaction and the mean normal stress depend on velocity divergence and affinities of all chemical reactions; the law of mass action is violated in viscous flows. The results obtained in the frame of linear irreversible thermodynamics can be deduced from the proposed model for the particular case of small affinities. The reciprocal Onsager–Casimir relations are verified, the symmetry of kinetic coefficients is demonstrated, and the entropy production in a viscous flow is studied.},

@article{pub.1015673368,
 abstract = {The paper presents a comparative study of vibrational-chemical kinetics and heat transfer in carbon dioxide flows under Mars entry conditions for two classes of models: the state-to-state and multitemperature models. The state-to-state approach treats each vibrational state of a molecule as a separate chemical species, thus providing a very detailed flow description. Reduced multitemperature models are based on nonequilibrium quasi-stationary Boltzmann distributions over vibrational energy with vibrational temperatures of different modes. Implementation of multitemperature models requires much less computational effort, making them rather attractive for engineering applications. Simulations have been performed for the upper part of the Mars Pathfinder entry trajectory. Comparisons between different models demonstrate a good agreement for the flowfield variables obtained using the state-to-state and multitemperature approaches, except some discrepancies for the species mole fractions prediction. This conclusion is encouraging for computational fluid dynamics, since it confirms that multitemperature models, while not being so much detailed as state to state, are still able to capture the main peculiarities of thermal and chemical nonequilibrium flows. The transport and thermochemical models have been validated using experimental data obtained in the NASA Hypersonic Pulse ground test facility. It is shown that both state-to-state and advanced multitemperature transport models used in the present simulations provide a better agreement for the heating predictions compared to traditional models.},

A modified Chapman–Enskog method is used for the determination of chemical reaction and vibrational transition rates and non-equilibrium pressure. Constitutive equations depend on the thermodynamic forces: velocity divergence and chemical reaction/transition affinity. As an application, N2 flow with vibrational relaxation across a shock wave is investigated. Two distinct processes occur behind the shock: for small values of the distance the affinity is large and vibrational relaxation is in its initial stage; for large distances the affinity is small and the chemical reaction is in its final stage. The affinity contributes more to the transition rate than the velocity divergence and the effect of these two contributions are more important for small distances from the shock front. For the non-equilibrium pressure, the term associated with the bulk viscosity increases by a small amount the hydrostatic pressure.},

While the effect of rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom on transport properties was widely discussed in the literature, the influence of electronic excitation is generally neglected in the transport theory. Usually atomic species are considered like particles without internal structure. It is the reason why in the expressions for the heat flux and mean normal stress the internal heat conductivity and bulk viscosity coefficients do not appear.

For VV- and VT-transitions the original approximations of the rate coefficients have been modified to make it possible to apply the inverse Laplace transformation in the analytical form. A satisfactory approximation of the state-resolved dissociation rate coefficient allowing for the application of the inverse Laplace transformation is also proposed. For all the considered reactions, analytical expressions for the cross sections are obtained. The results are analyzed in the wide range of energies and vibrational levels. It is shown that the cross sections of VV transitions increase almost linearly with the energy of the colliding particles. VT-exchanges and the dissociation reaction manifest threshold behavior and their cross sections are nonmonotonic. The dissociation threshold shifts significantly towards the low-energy region for high vibrational states. Using the hard sphere model for the dissociation cross section results in significant inaccuracy. The results of our work can be applied in nonequilibrium fluid dynamics, while simulating rarefied gas flows using the direct Monte-Carlo methods.},

 abstract = {In the present monograph, we develop the kinetic theory of transport phenomena and relaxation processes in the flows of reacting gas mixtures and discuss its applications to strongly non-equilibrium conditions. The main attention is focused on the influence of non-equilibrium kinetics on gas dynamics and transport properties. Closed systems of fluid dynamic equations are derived from the kinetic equations in different approaches. We consider the most accurate approach taking into account the state-to-state kinetics in a flow, as well as simplified multi-temperature and one-temperature models based on quasi-stationary distributions. Within these approaches, we propose the algorithms for the calculation of the transport coefficients and rate coefficients of chemical reactions and energy exchanges in non-equilibrium flows; the developed techniques are based on the fundamental kinetic theory principles. The theory is applied to the modeling of non-equilibrium flows behind strong shock waves, in the boundary layer, and in nozzles. The comparison of the results obtained within the frame of different approaches is presented, the advantages of the new state-to-state kinetic model are discussed, and the limits of validity for simplified models are established. The book can be interesting for scientists and graduate students working on physical gas dynamics, aerothermodynamics, heat and mass transfer, non-equilibrium physical-chemical kinetics, and kinetic theory of gases.},

 abstract = {In the present paper, reaction and energy relaxation rates as well as the normal stress are studied for viscous gas flows with vibrational and chemical non-equilibrium. Using the modified Chapman-Enskog method, multi-temperature models based on the Treanor and Boltzmann vibrational distributions are developed for the general case taking into account all kinds of vibrational energy transitions, exchange reactions, dissociation, and recombination. Integral equations specifying the first-order corrections to the normal mean stress and reaction rates are derived, as well as approximate systems of linear equations for their numerical computation. Generalized thermodynamic driving forces associated with all non-equilibrium processes are introduced. It is shown that normal stresses and rates of non-equilibrium processes can be expressed in terms of the same driving forces; the symmetry of kinetic coefficients in these expressions is proven. The developed general model is applied to a particular case of a pure N2 viscous flow with slow VT relaxation. Normal stress and rates of vibrational relaxation are studied for various ratios of vibrational and translational temperatures. The cross effects between different vibrational transitions in viscous flows are evaluated, along with the influence of anharmonicity and flow compressibility on the first-order corrections to the relaxation rate. Limits of validity for the widely used Landau–Teller model of vibrational relaxation are indicated.},

The role of various energy transfers and chemical reactions in the formation of nonequilibrium vibrational distributions in a shock heated CO flow is studied, and the influence of state-to-state distributions on macroscopic flow parameters and radiation intensity is discussed.},

 abstract = {We propose a convenient formulation of elemental transport coefficients in chemically reacting and plasma flows locally approaching thermodynamic equilibrium. A set of transport coefficients for elemental diffusion velocities, heat flux, and electric current is introduced. These coefficients relate the transport fluxes with the electric field and with the spatial gradients of elemental fractions, pressure, and temperature. The proposed formalism based on chemical elements and fully symmetric with the classical transport theory based on chemical species, is particularly suitable to model mixing and demixing phenomena due to diffusion of chemical elements. The aim of this work is threefold: to define a simple and rigorous framework suitable for numerical implementation, to allow order of magnitude estimations and qualitative predictions of elemental transport phenomena, and to gain a deeper insight into the physics of chemically reacting flows near local equilibrium.},

 abstract = {We study coupling of vibrational relaxation and chemical reactions in nonequilibrium viscous multitemperature flows. A general theoretical model is proposed on the basis of the Chapman-Enskog method modified for strongly nonequilibrium reacting flows; the model differs from models commonly used in computational fluid dynamics since it is able to capture additional cross-coupling terms arising in viscous flow due to compressibility and mutual influence of all nonequilibrium processes occurring in a mixture. The set of fluid dynamic equations is derived starting from the Boltzmann equation; the relaxation terms in these equations are described using the kinetic transport theory formalism. Reaction and relaxation rates depend on the distribution function and thus differ in the zero-order and first-order approximations of the Chapman-Enskog method. An algorithm for the calculation of multitemperature reaction and relaxation rates in both inviscid and viscous flows is proposed for the harmonic oscillator model. This algorithm is applied to estimate the mutual effect of vibrational relaxation and dissociation in binary mixtures of N(2) and N, and O(2) and O, under various nonequilibrium conditions. It is shown that modification of the Landau-Teller expression for the VT relaxation term works rather well in nitrogen, whereas it fails to predict correctly the relaxation rate in oxygen at high temperatures. In oxygen (in contrast to nitrogen), the first-order cross effects of dissociation and VT relaxation are found to be significant. A method for calculation of vibrational relaxation time based on the kinetic theory definition is suggested. Two-temperature dissociation rate coefficients are calculated in the zero- and first-order approximations and compared to other models.},

 abstract = {State-to-state approach for theoretical study of transport properties in atomic gases with excited electronic degrees of freedom of both neutral and ionized species is developed. The dependence of atomic radius on the electronic configuration of excited atoms is taken into account in the transport algorithm. Different cutoff criteria for increasing atomic radius are discussed and the limits of applicability for these criteria are evaluated. The validity of a Slater-like model for the calculation of state-resolved transport coefficients in neutral and ionized atomic gases is shown. For ionized flows, a method of evaluation for effective cross-sections of resonant charge-transfer collisions is suggested. Accurate kinetic theory algorithms for modelling the state-specific transport properties are applied for the prediction of transport coefficients in shock heated flows. Based on the numerical observations, different distributions over electronic states behind the shock front are considered. For the Boltzmann-like distributions at temperatures greater than 14,000K, an important effect of electronic excitation on the partial thermal conductivity and viscosity coefficients is found for both neutral and ionized atomic gases: increasing radius of excited atoms causes a strong decrease in these transport coefficients. Similarly, the presence of electronically excited states with increased atomic radii leads to reduced diffusion coefficients. Nevertheless the overall impact of increasing effective cross-sections on the transport properties just behind the shock front under hypersonic reentry conditions is found to be minor since the populations of high-lying electronic energy levels behind the shock waves are low.},

 abstract = {The influence of electronic excitation on transport processes in non-equilibrium high-temperature ionized mixture flows is studied. Two five-component mixtures, N2/N2+/N/N+/e− and O2/O2+/O/O+/e−, are considered taking into account the electronic degrees of freedom for atomic species as well as the rotational-vibrational-electronic degrees of freedom for molecular species, both neutral and ionized. Using the modified Chapman-Enskog method, the transport coefficients (thermal conductivity, shear viscosity and bulk viscosity, diffusion and thermal diffusion) are calculated in the temperature range 500–50 000 K. Thermal conductivity and bulk viscosity coefficients are strongly affected by electronic states, especially for neutral atomic species. Shear viscosity, diffusion, and thermal diffusion coefficients are not sensible to electronic excitation if the size of excited states is assumed to be constant. The limits of applicability for the Stokes relation are discussed; at high temperatures, this relation is violated not only for molecular species but also for electronically excited atomic gases. Two test cases of strongly non-equilibrium flows behind plane shock waves corresponding to the spacecraft re-entry (Hermes and Fire II) are simulated numerically. Fluid-dynamic variables and heat fluxes are evaluated in gases with electronic excitation. In inviscid flows without chemical-radiative coupling, the flow-field is weakly affected by electronic states; however, in viscous flows, their influence can be more important, in particular, on the convective heat flux. The contribution of different dissipative processes to the heat transfer is evaluated as well as the effect of reaction rate coefficients. The competition of diffusion and heat conduction processes reduces the overall effect of electronic excitation on the convective heating, especially for the Fire II test case. It is shown that reliable models of chemical reaction rates are of great importance for accurate predictions of the fluid dynamic variables and heat fluxes.},

We consider three electronic terms and account for VV exchanges of vibrational energy within each electronic term, VT transitions of vibrational energy into a translational one, and VE exchange of vibrational energy between electronic terms. The initial vibrational state of the gas is strongly nonequilibrium. The effect of VE exchange on the vibrational relaxation of CO molecules is estimated for different kinds of initial vibrational distributions, in particular, the Treanor and Gordiets ones generalized for gases with electronically excited states. The set of equations of state-to-state vibrational kinetics, together with the gas dynamic equations, is solved numerically in the zero-order approximation of the Chapman–Enskog method for the case of spatially homogeneous relaxation. The following results are obtained: neglecting VE exchanges leads to an incorrect assessment of the number density for each electronic level; however, the error is small for the ground electronic state. It is shown that VE exchanges qualitatively affect the time dependence of the vibrational temperature.},

We consider a high-temperature chemically reacting five-component ionized mixture of nitrogen species (N2/N22/N/N+/e−) taking into account electronic degrees of freedom in N and N+ (170 and 625 electronic energy levels respectively), and electronic-rotational-vibrational modes in N2 and N2+ (5 and 7 electronic terms). Non-equilibrium reactions of ionization, dissociation, recombination and charge-transfer are included to the kinetic scheme. The system of governing equations is written under the assumption that translation and internal energy relaxation is fast whereas chemical reactions and ionization proceed on the macroscopic gas-dynamics time-scale. The developed model is applied to simulate the flow behind a plane shock wave under initial conditions characteristic for the spacecraft re-entry from an interplanetary flight (Hermes and Fire II experiments). Fluid-dynamic parameters behind the shock wave as well as transport coefficients and the heat flux are calculated for the (N2/N2+/N/N+/e−) mixture. The effect of electronic excitation on kinetics, dynamics and heat transfer is analyzed. Whereas the contribution of electronic degrees of freedom to the flow macroparameters is negligible, their influence on the heat flux is found to be important under conditions of Hermes re-entry.},

General equations specifying the relaxation terms in the viscous approximation for a mixture of anharmonic oscillators are derived. Numerical calculations for a pure N2 flow are presented for various flow conditions.

 abstract = {In the present paper, the influence of self-diffusion of vibrationally excited states on the fluid dynamics and surface heat transfer in an axisymmetric Mach 7.2 air flow past a sphere-cone is discussed. Two models for state-to-state transport properties are considered: a simplified model using the Eucken’s relation for thermal conductivity and Fick’s law for diffusion velocities with the constant Lewis number, and a rigorous kinetic theory based model for the calculation of state-specific thermal conductivity, diffusion and thermal diffusion coefficients. The simplified model is applied for the flowfield simulation to avoid high computational costs. For the application of the accurate kinetic theory approach, a post-processing procedure is used. Inclusion of self-diffusion results in an increase in the surface heat flux of up to 6.5% upstream of a shoulder region. Thermal conductivity is found to be the primary contributor to surface heat flux; the influence of mass and thermal diffusion is found to be negligible. Self-diffusion has a considerably greater influence in decreasing heat flux in the downstream regions far from stagnation point.},

Applying the inverse Laplace transform to approximations for state-resolved rate coefficients obtained by quasi-classical trajectory calculations we derive analytical expressions for the cross sections. The results are analyzed in a wide range of energies and vibrational levels. It is shown that cross sections of VV transitions increase almost linearly with the energy of the colliding particles. VT exchanges and dissociation reactions manifest threshold behaviour, and their cross sections are non-monotonic. The dissociation threshold is considerably shifted towards the low energy region for high vibrational states. Using the hard sphere model for the dissociation cross section results in significant inaccuracy.

 abstract = {Elemental transport coefficients are extensively used for modeling chemically reacting and plasma flows when the proximity to local equilibrium is exploited to combine the ordinary transport coefficients into a few elemental coefficients. A deeper insight into the physics of chemically reacting flows near local equilibrium can be achieved by looking only at a reduced number of relevant parameters in the expression of the flow transport properties. A new technique to calculate chemical derivatives using an analytical method which strongly reduces computational effort and numerical errors is introduced. A general formalism for elemental diffusion velocities, heat flux and electric current for plasma flows near local equilibrium is then derived. An order of magnitude analysis shows how to identify the main contributions to the transport fluxes among: elemental fractions gradients, pressure or temperature gradients, electric field. The resulting theoretical framework is particularly suitable for numerical implementation. The present contribution aims to provide a summary of the theoretical framework described above. Numerical examples of chemical derivatives and elemental transport coefficients are given. Results are presented for a carbon dioxide mixture of practical interest for aerospace applications and atmospheric entry problems.},

 abstract = {A complete vibrational state-specific kinetic scheme describing dissociating carbon dioxide mixtures is proposed. CO<sub>2</sub> symmetric, bending and asymmetric vibrations and dissociation-recombination are strongly coupled through intermode vibrational energy transfers. Comparative study of state-resolved rate coefficients is carried out; the effect of different transitions may vary considerably with temperature. A nonequilibrium 1-D boundary layer flow typical to hypersonic planetary entry is studied in the state-to-state approach. To assess the sensitivity of fluid-dynamic variables and heat transfer to various vibrational transitions and chemical reactions, corresponding processes are successively included to the kinetic scheme. It is shown that vibrational-translational (VT) transitions in the symmetric and asymmetric modes do not alter the flow and can be neglected whereas the VT<sub>2</sub> exchange in the bending mode is the main channel of vibrational relaxation. Intermode vibrational exchanges affect the flow implicitly, through energy redistribution enhancing VT relaxation; the dominating role belongs to near-resonant transitions between symmetric and bending modes as well as between CO molecules and CO<sub>2</sub> asymmetric mode. Strong coupling between VT<sub>2</sub> relaxation and chemical reactions is emphasized. While vibrational distributions and average vibrational energy show strong dependence on the kinetic scheme, the heat flux is more sensitive to chemical reactions.},

 abstract = {Coupled state-to-state vibrational-chemical kinetics, gas dynamics, and heat transfer in the five-component mixture of dissociated CO<sub>2</sub> are studied using the complete three-mode kinetic model and the reduced scheme involving mainly the vibrational states of the asymmetric mode. The emphasis is on the effect of asymmetric vibrations on the rate of dissociation, fluid dynamic variables, and heat flux. It is shown that intermode vibrational energy transitions between CO and CO<sub>2</sub> asymmetric mode may considerably decrease the rate of dissociation; the presence of CO in the mixture quickly depletes high vibrational states and thus inhibits dissociation at low temperatures. The reduced model overpredicts populations of highly located states of the asymmetric mode, especially when intermode VV transitions are neglected; therefore, using the simplified model in flows with dominating dissociation may yield overestimated dissociation rate. In the hypersonic flow along the stagnation line, the influence of asymmetric vibrations on the fluid dynamics and heat transfer is weak; the main role belongs to chemical reactions and VT transitions in the bending mode. In this case, the computationally efficient simplified model can be used to predict macroscopic variables and heat flux without significant loss of accuracy.},

 abstract = {KAPPA, an open-source software library for the computation of thermodynamic and transport properties in non-equilibrium gas flows and species production rates, is presented. Thermodynamic properties rely on custom databases which describe the characteristics of atoms and molecules and interaction features. Mixture thermodynamic properties are formulated from species quantities. Species production rates are based on elementary chemical reactions and vibrational energy transitions. Transport properties are derived from kinetic theory which provides relationships for transport coefficients depending on the flow model. Several levels of non-equilibrium flow description are implemented: the detailed state-to-state (STS) approach, multi-temperature and one-temperature models. Sets of transport coefficients depend on the deviation from equilibrium; in the state-to-state model, they include state-resolved diffusion coefficients for each pair of vibrational states. A highly modular, object-oriented application program interface (API) has been developed. The adopted object-oriented programming paradigm (OOP), along with the implemented models of state-resolved physico-chemical relaxation rates, is presented. The design of the library allows it to be easily included in existing CFD codes and is aimed at code reusability and readability. Program Title: KAPPA Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/mrx9n35bvs.1 Licensing provisions: GNU General Public Licence, version 3. Programming language: C++; developed and tested with Intel Compiler v. 18.x and GNU. External routines/libraries: KAPPA must be linked to yaml-cpp [1] in order to read human-readable database files and to Armadillo [2] for solving algebraic linear systems. Nature of problem: Numerical computation of transport properties and rate exchange coefficients for non-equilibrium reacting flows. Solution method: Non-equilibrium reacting flow is treated by a rigorous state-to-state (STS) kinetic theory approach. Restrictions: At present, KAPPA is validated for computing transport properties and rate exchange coefficients using the state-to-state (STS) approach; 1- and 2-temperature models have still to be validated, but they are already implemented. C++ compiler is mandatory. Unusual features: KAPPA is an open-source object-oriented highly modular and easy-to-maintain C++ software library which implements rigorous mathematical kinetic theory models. Additional comments: KAPPA project adopts Git [3], a free and open source distributed version control system. A public repository dedicated to KAPPA project [4] has been created on github, a web-based hosting service for software development projects using git versioning system.

 abstract = {The present study is aimed in providing a framework for applying different continuum models of relaxation processes in carbon dioxide flows. Kinetic equations for the distribution function are written taking into account the CO2 structure and various mechanisms of vibrational relaxation; collision operators for different internal energy transitions are derived. For weak non-equilibrium conditions, a one-temperature model is developed with emphasis to the bulk viscosity phenomenon. For strong non-equilibrium conditions, multi-temperature models are introduced, and their advantages and limitations are discussed. A general algorithm for calculating vibrational relaxation time in polyatomic molecules is proposed. Bulk viscosity coefficients are studied in the temperature range 200–2500 K; it is shown that uncoupling rotational and vibrational modes results in essentially overpredicted values of the bulk viscosity coefficient at low temperatures. The shock wave structure in CO2 is studied using the continuum models and compared with the solution obtained in the frame of the model kinetic approach; the effect of bulk viscosity on the shock wave width and temperature profile is evaluated. It is concluded that well justified choice of the model extends considerably the range of applicability of the continuum approach for non-equilibrium flow simulations.},

 abstract = {The effect of the vibrational level of a molecule on the relaxation time of its rotational energy is studied within the state-to-state kinetic theory approach. The rotational levels of molecules are described by the non-rigid rotator model, while the interaction between molecules is described by the variable soft sphere model. This model is used to calculate the N2-N, O2-O, and NO-O collision cross sections for different vibrational and rotational levels of molecules. The rotational energy relaxation time is introduced for each vibrational level using the methods of the kinetic theory of nonequilibrium processes. The relaxation times are numerically calculated within a broad temperature range and compared with the relaxation time determined by the well-known Parker formula. The effect of various multi-quantum rotational transitions on the accuracy of the rotational relaxation time calculation is analyzed, and the convergence of the solution with an increase in the maximally possible number of quanta transmitted in the course of transition is demonstrated. It has been established that the vibrational state of a molecule has an appreciable effect on the rotational energy relaxation time in the state-to-state approach, and using the Parker formula may lead to a noticeable error in the calculation of state-to-state transport coefficients. The Parker formula provides a satisfactory agreement with the results obtained via the averaging of state-resolved relaxation times with a Boltzmann vibrational energy distribution in the one-temperature approximation at moderate temperatures.},

The effect of several parameters on the reaction rate coefficients is discussed; it is shown that the nonequilibrium factor in the expression for the rate coefficients of exchange reactions is much less sensitive to the number of accounted vibrational states and model parameters than that of dissociation. On the other hand, the choice of thermal equilibrium Arrhenius law parameters is crucial for the correct prediction of rate coefficients for both reactions. Developed models are implemented to the one-dimensional boundary layer code for coupled state-to-state simulations of nonequilibrium CO<sub>2</sub> flows under Mars entry conditions. Vibrational distributions, mixture composition, flow variables, and heat flux are studied for several kinetic schemes and different models of chemical reactions. Whereas including the exchange reactions weakly affects the flow, switching between the Park and McKenzie sets of parameters results in significant modification of the kinetic mechanisms; for the McKenzie model, recombination near the wall is a dominating reaction, whereas for the Park model, chemical reactions are frozen. Different contributions to the heat flux are evaluated and a satisfactory agreement with experiments is shown.},

 abstract = {The objective of this study is to examine various combinations of vibration-chemical coupling models in high-temperature air and oxygen flows behind shock waves. Simulations are carried out in the frame of the state-to-state approach for detailed vibrational and chemical kinetics in the Euler approximation. Great variety of state-resolved models for the rate coefficients of vibrational energy transitions and chemical reactions are assessed and validated against experimental data; among them are first-order perturbation (SSH) and forced harmonic oscillator (FHO) models; well-known Marrone–Treanor dissociation model with parameters either obtained empirically or by fitting quasiclassical trajectory calculations; new models for state-specific Zeldovich reactions. To validate the models, the results of numerical flow simulations are compared with experimental investigations in a wide range of initial mixture compositions and shock wave velocities. Among numerous model variants, a few models providing the best agreement with the experimental data on the vibrational temperature in oxygen flows and measured NO radiation in air flows are recommended for different sets of free stream conditions. The impact of NO excited states produced in Zeldovich reactions is evaluated; it is shown that neglecting the vibrational excitation of NO molecules may lead to significantly underpredicted maximum of NO number density. In the framework of the code performance study, Matlab and Fortran implementations were compared, the most significant bottlenecks procedures were identified by profiling analysis, and remarkable speed-up was achieved by code optimisation.},

Vibrational–translational transitions in the bending mode and inter-mode exchange of vibrational quanta are considered. In the zero-order approximation of the generalized Chapman–Enskog method, the energy relaxation rates in the coupled symmetric–bending and asymmetric modes are expressed in terms of thermodynamic forces similar to chemical reaction affinities, and a compact representation for the vibrational energy production rates is proposed. Linearized theory is developed, and analytical ratios of linearized relaxation rates to those defined by the original Landau–Teller (LT) theory are obtained. The relaxation rates are calculated using the Schwartz–Slawsky–Herzfeld (SSH) and forced harmonic oscillator models for the vibrational energy transition probabilities in the temperature range 200 K–10 000 K. For inter-mode exchanges, using the SSH theory yields significantly underpredicted relaxation rates. The ranges of applicability for the LT formula and linearized theory are estimated; the original LT formula for inter-mode vibrational energy exchanges is not capable of accounting for the excitation of both vibrational modes; linearized models yield better results. Possible steps for improving the numerically efficient LT model are proposed.},

It is shown that a modification of the Landau–Teller formula can be obtained from the rigorous theoretical expressions using several limiting assumptions. Whereas VT relaxation in the bending mode can be described by the Landau–Teller approximation with a satisfactory accuracy, its application to the inter-mode exchange requires introducing relaxation times depending on the vibrational temperatures of the modes involved to the transitions.},

 abstract = {Several state-resolved and two-temperature models for the rate coefficients of reaction CO+CO=CO2+C are assessed, and a new simple state dependent model is proposed. Various models for the two-temperature non-equilibrium factor are considered: the theoretical alpha-model and the models based on averaging the state-resolved rate coefficients over the Boltzmann distribution. It is shown that for the Starik model, taking into account vibrational excitation of the partner CO molecule as well as the reaction product does not affect the two-temperature reaction rate coefficients. If the vibrational excitation of only one CO molecule is taken into account, the Starik model and that proposed in this work with the parameter U = ∞ yield identical results. However, our model is more general since it is capable to account for the preferential reaction mechanism from high vibrational states. Two-temperature rate coefficients provided by the a-model agree well with the averaged state-to-state ones, but the parameter α cannot be fixed in the entire temperature range and has to be chosen according to the specific ratio T/Tv. Thus, our computationally efficient state-specific model is recommended for state-to-state flow simulations; when being averaged with different non-equilibrium vibrational distributions, it can be used for modeling two-temperature flows.},

The full kinetic scheme including all vibrational states and different kinds of vibrational energy transitions within and between CO2 modes is proposed and implemented to the 0-D code for spatially homogeneous relaxation. Contributions of various energy transitions are evaluated, and dominating relaxation mechanisms are identified for two generic test cases corresponding to compression (excitation) and expansion (deactivation) regimes. It is shown that the main relaxation channels are vibrational-translation (VT) transitions in the symmetric and bending modes and two intermode vibrational-vibrational (VV) exchanges. Reduced-order models are assessed by comparisons with the results of full state-to-state simulations. The commonly used two-temperature model with the single vibrational temperature fails to describe the relaxation for all considered initial conditions. The three-temperature model provides a good agreement with the state-to-state simulations for the excitation regime, but yields a considerable discrepancy for the deactivation mode.

@article{pub.1136927410,
 abstract = {It is well known that numerical simulations of high-speed reacting flows, in
the framework of state-to-state formulations, are the most detailed but also
often prohibitively computationally expensive. In this work, we start to
investigate the possibilities offered by the use of machine learning methods
for state-to-state approaches to alleviate such burden.
  In this regard, several tasks have been identified. Firstly, we assessed the
potential of state-of-the-art data-driven regression models based on machine
learning to predict the relaxation source terms which appear in the right-hand
side of the state-to-state Euler system of equations for a one-dimensional
reacting flow of a N$_2$/N binary mixture behind a plane shock wave. It is
found that, by appropriately choosing the regressor and opportunely tuning its
hyperparameters, it is possible to achieve accurate predictions compared to the
full-scale state-to-state simulation in significantly shorter times.
  Secondly, we investigated different strategies to speed-up our in-house
state-to-state solver by coupling it with the best-performing pre-trained
machine learning algorithm. The embedding of machine learning methods into
ordinary differential equations solvers may offer a speed-up of several orders
of magnitude but some care should be paid for how and where such coupling is
realized. Performances are found to be strongly dependent on the mutual nature
of the interfaced codes.
  Finally, we aimed at inferring the full solution of the state-to-state Euler
system of equations by means of a deep neural network completely by-passing the
use of the state-to-state solver while relying only on data. Promising results
suggest that deep neural networks appear to be a viable technology also for
these tasks.},

It is shown that for single-component gases, the proposed approach yields good accuracy and calculation speedup up to 3 times for atoms and up to 19 times for molecules. The speedup is significant for multi-component mixtures and increases with the mixture complexity, attaining for four- and five-component mixtures from 597 to 1196 times correspondingly. Ways to improve the accuracy of neural-network predictions of multi-component mixtures transport coefficients are discussed. },

 abstract = {Three continuum models extending the conventional Navier–Stokes–Fourier approach for modeling the shock wave structure in carbon dioxide are developed using the generalized Chapman–Enskog method. Multi-temperature models are based on splitting multiple vibrational relaxation mechanisms into fast and slow processes and introducing vibrational temperatures of various CO2 modes. The one-temperature model takes into account relaxation processes through bulk viscosity and internal thermal conductivity. All developed models are free of limitations introduced by the assumptions of a calorically perfect gas and constant Prandtl number; thermodynamic properties and all transport coefficients are calculated rigorously in each cell of the grid. Simulations are carried out for Mach numbers 3–7; the results are compared with solutions obtained in the frame of other approaches: multi-temperature Euler equations, model kinetic equations, and models with constant Prandtl numbers. The influence of bulk viscosity and Prandtl number on the fluid-dynamic variables, viscous stress, heat flux, and total enthalpy is studied. Bulk viscosity plays an important role in sufficiently rarefied gases under weak deviations from equilibrium; in multi-temperature models, non-equilibrium effects are associated with slow relaxation processes rather than with bulk viscosity. Using a constant Prandtl number yields over-predicted values of the heat flux. Contributions of various energy modes to the total heat flux are evaluated, with emphasis on the compensation of translational–rotational and vibrational energy fluxes.},

 abstract = {Numerous applications have required the study of CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ plasmas since the 1960s, from CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ lasers to spacecraft heat shields. However, in recent years, intense research activities on the subject have restarted because of environmental problems associated with CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ emissions. The present review provides a synthesis of the current state of knowledge on the physical chemistry of cold CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ plasmas. In particular, the different modeling approaches implemented to address specific aspects of CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ plasmas are presented. Throughout the paper, the importance of conducting joint experimental, theoretical and modeling studies to elucidate the complex couplings at play in CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ plasmas is emphasized. Therefore, the experimental data that are likely to bring relevant constraints to the different modeling approaches are first reviewed. Second, the calculation of some key elementary processes obtained with semi-empirical, classical and quantum methods is presented. In order to describe the electron kinetics, the latest coherent sets of cross section satisfying the constraints of “electron swarm” analyses are introduced, and the need for self-consistent calculations for determining accurate electron energy distribution function (EEDF) is evidenced. The main findings of the latest zero-dimensional (0D) global models about the complex chemistry of CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ and its dissociation products in different plasma discharges are then given, and full state-to-state (STS) models of only the vibrational-dissociation kinetics developed for studies of spacecraft shields are described. Finally, two important points for all applications using CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ containing plasma are discussed: the role of surfaces in contact with the plasma, and the need for 2D/3D models to capture the main features of complex reactor geometries including effects induced by fluid dynamics on the plasma properties. In addition to bringing together the latest advances in the description of CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ non-equilibrium plasmas, the results presented here also highlight the fundamental data that are still missing and the possible routes that still need to be investigated.Graphic abstract},

 abstract = {In the present study, a new hybrid approach is proposed to modeling coupled vibrational and chemical kinetics in carbon dioxide (CO2) and products of its decomposition. The study develops and completes our previous work carried out for a single-component CO2 gas. The model is based on self-consistent implementation of state-to-state chemical and energy production rates into the equations of multi-temperature CO2 kinetics. It distinguishes vibrational temperatures of all CO2 modes and diatomic species and thus takes into account multiple relaxation mechanisms including intra-mode, inter-mode, and inter-molecular energy transitions as well as state-specific dissociation and exchange reactions. Other advantages of the proposed full multi-temperature approach are the possibility of capturing strong non-equilibrium effects in a flow, straightforward implementation of the chemical-vibrational coupling terms, easy update for new models of state-specific reaction rates. Comparisons with the results obtained in the frame of a detailed but numerically demanding state-to-state approach for the problem of spatially homogeneous relaxation showed good accuracy of the new model under the wide range of initial conditions; at the same time, traditional multi-temperature approaches failed to provide accurate predictions of non-equilibrium flow parameters under arbitrary deviations from equilibrium. Effects of chemical reaction models and selective mode excitation are assessed. The numerical efficiency of the developed model is found acceptable compared to that of the state-to-state approach.},

 abstract = {State-to-state numerical simulations of high-speed reacting flows are the most detailed but also often prohibitively computationally expensive. In this work, we explore the usage of machine learning algorithms to alleviate such a burden. Several tasks have been identified. Firstly, data-driven machine learning regression models were compared for the prediction of the relaxation source terms appearing in the right-hand side of the state-to-state Euler system of equations for a one-dimensional reacting flow of a N2/N binary mixture behind a plane shock wave. Results show that, by appropriately choosing the regressor and opportunely tuning its hyperparameters, it is possible to achieve accurate predictions compared to the full-scale state-to-state simulation in significantly shorter times. Secondly, several strategies to speed-up our in-house state-to-state solver were investigated by coupling it with the best-performing pre-trained machine learning algorithm. The embedding of machine learning algorithms into ordinary differential equations solvers may offer a speed-up of several orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, performances are found to be strongly dependent on the interfaced codes and the set of variables onto which the coupling is realized. Finally, the solution of the state-to-state Euler system of equations was inferred by means of a deep neural network by-passing the use of the solver while relying only on data. Promising results suggest that deep neural networks appear to be a viable technology also for this task.},

 abstract = {Boundary conditions for fluid-dynamic variables of strongly nonequilibrium multicomponent gas mixture flows in slip regime are derived systematically by two different approaches. The flow is described in the framework of the state-to-state model for coupled detailed vibrational and chemical kinetics. The specular-diffusive model is applied for particles interaction with the solid wall, and the surface is assumed to be partially catalytic with possible state-specific chemical reactions and vibrational energy transitions described by a simple model based on the analogy with recombination coefficients. The first theoretical approach uses the technique proposed by Grad whereas the second one is based on the kinetic boundary condition. It is shown that for the Maxwell scattering kernel the two approaches are equivalent; at the same time, the approach based on the kinetic boundary condition provides more rigorous mathematical description of the problem and can be easily generalized for other scattering kernels and gas-surface interaction models accounting for surface inner geometry. The resulting boundary conditions are expressed in terms of state-specific transport coefficients: thermal conductivity, multicomponent diffusion of vibrational states, thermal diffusion, shear and bulk viscosity, and relaxation pressure. The dependence of the boundary conditions on the normal mean stress is obtained for the first time. Under thermal equilibrium conditions, the derived expressions reduce to known relations obtained earlier in the one-temperature approach.},

Based on the obtained data, we recommend the use of machine-learning methods in the problems of nonequilibrium gas dynamics with detailed vibrational and chemical kinetics. Ways of further optimizing the considered methods are discussed.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we study a coupled problem of gas dynamics, vibrational relaxation, and dissociation in the flow of oxygen behind reflected shock waves. The detailed state-to-state kinetic approach, which is based on coupled solution of the momentum- and energy-conservation equations with balance equations for the populations of the vibrational states of molecules and the concentrations of oxygen atoms, is used. The conditions implemented in recent experiments in shock tubes are considered. For various models of physical and chemical processes, a comparison is made with experimental data; by varying the parameters of the models, it is possible to achieve the satisfactory agreement of all gas-dynamic parameters with measurement results. The key feature of the used approach is the inclusion of partial vibrational-chemical relaxation in the time interval between the passage of incident and reflected shock waves. Rejection of the assumption of frozen relaxation leads to the fact that the reflected shock wave propagates through a vibrationally nonequilibrium gas, which significantly affects the kinetics and gas dynamics. Taking into account partial relaxation ensures good agreement between the pressure calculated behind the front of the reflected shock wave and the pressure measured in the experiment. On the other hand, a comparison with the vibrational temperature calculated indirectly from spectroscopic experimental data under the assumption of frozen relaxation shows noticeable differences near the wave front. It is concluded that it is necessary to improve the method for retrieving gas-dynamic parameters taking into account vibrational excitation before the front of the reflected shock wave.},

 abstract = {Several advanced models for multi-temperature vibrational energy relaxation rates are implemented to study adiabatic bath relaxation in carbon dioxide, among them a hybrid model based on state-to-state relaxation rates, the model based on the rigorous Chapman–Enskog theory, and modifications of the Landau–Teller (LT) models. Different sets of rate coefficients for vibrational energy transitions (Schwartz, Slawsky and Herzfeld (SSH) theory, forced harmonic oscillator (FHO) model) are used as well as various techniques for the relaxation time evaluation. Based on isothermal bath simulations it is found that the FHO model provides good agreement with experimentally measured relaxation times. Assessment of relaxation models shows that the three-temperature model based on the Chapman–Enskog theory yields excellent agreement with the detailed hybrid approach while being more computationally efficient; two-temperature models and modifications of the LT formulas cannot provide reliable description of intermode exchanges in polyatomic gases. The choice of the model for transition probabilities is crucial for identifying key relaxation mechanisms. When the FHO model is applied, strongly coupled relaxation in all CO2 modes is found whereas the model of SSH yields overpredicted relaxation rate in the symmetric-bending mode and almost uncoupled slow relaxation in the asymmetric mode. Possible ways for further model validation under glow discharge conditions are discussed.},

Modeling state-to-state vibrational-chemical kinetics requires data on the rate coefficients of chemical reactions depending on the vibrational states of reacting molecules.
The present paper analyzes several previously described models of state-resolved reaction rate coefficients for air components. Using the data of state-of-the-art quasiclassical trajectory calculations, the simple semi-empirical Treanor‒Marrone model with dissociation from any vibrational level is improved. For this purpose, the parameter of model U is represented as a function of temperature and vibrational energy of reagents. For all dissociation reactions in air, recommendations are given on the optimal choice of parameters in the Arrhenius law and in the Treanor‒Marrone model; the suggested parameters provide an excellent agreement with the results of trajectory calculations in the temperature range of 1000–20 000 K for the entire range of vibrational energies of molecules. For Zeldovich exchange reactions, a simple and effective model is proposed, taking into account the vibrational excitation of both reagents and products.},

 abstract = {Bulk viscosity and acoustic wave propagation in polyatomic gases and their mixtures are studied in the frame of one-temperature and multi-temperature continuum models developed using the generalized Chapman–Enskog method. Governing equations and constitutive relations for both models are written, and the dispersion equations are derived. In the vibrationally nonequilibrium multi-component gas mixture, wave attenuation mechanisms include viscosity, thermal conductivity, bulk viscosity, diffusion, thermal diffusion, and vibrational relaxation; in the proposed approach these mechanisms are fully coupled contrarily to commonly used models based on the separation of classical Stokes–Kirchhoff attenuation and relaxation. Contributions of rotational and vibrational modes to the bulk viscosity coefficient are evaluated. In the one-temperature approach, artificial separation of rotational and vibrational modes causes great overestimation of bulk viscosity whereas using the effective internal energy relaxation time yields good agreement with experimental data and molecular-dynamic simulations. In the multi-temperature approach, the bulk viscosity is specified only by rotational modes. The developed two-temperature model provides excellent agreement of theoretical and experimental attenuation coefficients in polyatomic gases; both the location and the value of its maximum are predicted correctly. One-temperature dispersion relations do not reproduce the non-monotonic behavior of the attenuation coefficient; large bulk viscosity improves its accuracy only in the very limited frequency range. It is emphasized that implementing large bulk viscosity in the one-temperature Navier–Stokes–Fourier equations may lead to unphysical results.},

Using the developed software the multi-layer perceptron regression model is constructed and trained. The model is assessed in a binary mixture of molecular and atomic nitrogen taking into account 48 vibrational states; the coefficients are computed in the wide temperature range for the varying mixture composition. Good agreement of the results with the original transport coefficients calculated using rigorous but computationally expensive kinetic theory algorithms is shown. Applying machine learning techniques yields a significant speedup of about two orders of magnitude in the computation of transport coefficients.

Expressions for velocity slip, temperature jump, and mass fluxes of species are derived on the basis of the advanced kinetic boundary condition taking into account gain and loss of particles in surface processes; theoretical expressions for the mass fluxes obtained in the frame of various approaches are compared. The developed model is implemented to the fluid-dynamic solver for modeling dynamics and state-to-state air kinetics in the boundary layer near stagnation point. Several test cases corresponding to a various degree of gas rarefaction are considered. Recombination probabilities and effective reaction rates are calculated and compared to recent molecular-dynamic simulations; the proposed model yields the best agreement for the recombination rate coefficient. It is shown that temperature jump significantly affects fluid-dynamic parameters and surface heat flux; the role of heterogeneous reactions on the silica surface is weaker. In the surface heating, there is a competition between these two effects: whereas the temperature jump reduces the wall heat flux, surface reactions cause its increase, but to a lesser extent. It is concluded that the model proposed in this study describes self-consistently detailed vibrational kinetics, rarefaction effects, and surface reactions and can be applied both in continuum and slip flow regimes.},

 abstract = {The present study deals with numerical simulations of microwave (MW) discharges in nitrogen based on extended fluid-dynamic model. The set of governing equations for non-equilibrium gas-discharge plasma includes conservation equations for species number densities, electron energy density, Poisson equation for the electric field coupled to the multi-temperature Navier–Stokes fluid-dynamic equations taking into account thermal nonequilibrium; the power transmitted from MW radiation to electrons is determined from the Helmholtz equation. The kinetic scheme includes 61 reactions involving neutral molecules and atoms in the ground and electronically excited states, ions and electrons. The set of equations is solved for a two-dimensional problem under conditions of experiments at a pressure of 40 and 50 Torr and different electromagnetic wave frequencies and pulse duration. The dynamics of discharge formation and transition from the diffuse to the filament form is studied. The results are compared with experimental data, and a good agreement is shown for the time larger than 10 µs. The possible reasons for discrepancies at a shorter time are discussed and the effect of small oxygen impurities on the quantitative characteristics of the discharge are evaluated. The presence of a small oxygen impurity and seed electrons in the region of discharge formation yields a better agreement between numerical and experimental data.},

 abstract = {The extension of recently developed theoretical approach allowing to obtain slip boundary conditions for non-equilibrium multi-component gas flows by means of rigorous kinetic theory techniques is proposed. Gaseous mixture in the present work is described on the basis of the detailed state-to-state (STS) model, but all the assumptions made can be easily implemented for the one-and multi-temperature approximations. New form of the approach was developed with the objective of taking into consideration not only scattering but other non-equilibrium surface processes and examining their influence on the form of conditions. The proposed scheme allows to obtain conditions only in terms of transport coefficients and probabilities of surface processes along with macroparameters and to be further extended in order to account for more complex time-dependent kinetics of particles-solid wall interaction. Commonly applied Maxwell and Cercignani–Lampis (CL) scattering kernels are considered and it is shown that discrepancies in resulting expressions appear only in the temperature jump. The comparison of boundary conditions with other theoretical and phenomenological models is performed.},

 abstract = {We study the influence of vibrational and chemical relaxation behind the incident shock wave on the gas parameters behind the reflected wave. The detailed state-to-state approach is used to simulate the shock tube experiment for the pure oxygen flow. We extend our previous work including comparison with experimentally measured pressure time-histories behind the re-flected shock wave. The vibrational temperature time-histories are compared with both experimental and theoretical data obtained recently using simulations based on quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) method. The results show a weak role of dissociation reactions and, on the contrary, a significant effect of vibrational relaxation in the region between the incident and reflected shock waves on the pressure and temperature profiles. The best agreement with the experimental vibrational temperature is obtained for the combination of the Schwartz–Slawsky–Herzfeld (SSH) model of vibrational energy transitions and the state-specific Marrone–Treanor dissociation model with the parameter U = 3T. Three different definitions of the vibrational temperature are assessed, and their equivalence is proved. For more accurate comparison with experimental data we propose an additional correction to the experimental error which takes into account the effect of vibrational relaxation between the incident and reflected shocks. This correction is found large near the reflected shock front but tends to zero with rising distance.},

 abstract = {State-to-state and two-temperature theoretical models for high-temperature non-equilibrium reacting and radiating air flows are applied for simulations of a plane shock wave under conditions of the Fire II flight experiment. The detailed state-to-state model provides full coupling between internal energy transitions, chemical reactions and radiation. The reduced two-temperature model is based on the Boltzmann distributions over electronic states with the corresponding temperature. Transport coefficients, heat flux and radiative fluxes are calculated as functions of the distance from the shock front. The role of increasing diameters of atomic excited states in the heat transfer is assessed and found insignificant. Contributions of various processes to the heat fluxes are evaluated. For the trajectory point 1634 s, convective heating is found to be dominating. It is shown that under considered conditions, two-temperature model is not applicable for correct predictions of radiative heating.},

 abstract = {Nonequilibrium flows of air components behind reflected shock waves are systematically studied on the basis of several theoretical models for the rate coefficients of fully coupled vibrational energy exchanges and chemical reactions. Numerical simulations are performed in the frame of the state-to-state approach under initial conditions corresponding to recent shock-tube experiments in mixtures O 2 /Ar, NO/Ar, NO/N 2 /Ar. The model takes into account partial vibrational relaxation between the incident and reflected shock waves, state-resolved dissociation, recombination, exchange reactions with formation of NO in the vibrationally excited states, as well as vibrational–vibrational and vibrational–translational energy transitions. It is shown that for oxygen, relaxation between the incident and reflected shocks is not frozen, and taking it into account in the most test cases considerably improves the agreement of calculated and experimentally measured pressure. For NO-containing mixtures, the effect of intermediate relaxation is weaker. Average deviation of the number density of molecular species with respect to the experimental one is analyzed for several hundreds of numerical simulations; on the basis of these estimates, recommendations are given for the best choice of model parameters. These recommendations can be used for modeling high-temperature flows, in particular, under reentry conditions.},
