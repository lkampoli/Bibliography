In particular, the collision-induced vibrational excitation/relaxation of H2 molecules and particle–surface interaction (vibrational relaxation and recombinative desorption) have been considered in detail to estimate the importance of plasma volumetric recombination by molecular assisted reaction (MAR). Spatially resolved results show that MAR processes are effective very close to the divertor plate in a region smaller than 1.5mm from the divertor plate. For regions more distant the ionization of atoms, produced by MAR, starts to make molecular assisted recombination an ineffective reaction.},

 abstract = {Coupling direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) simulations with classical trajectory calculations is a powerful tool to improve predictive capabilities of computational dilute gas dynamics. The considerable increase in computational effort outlined in early applications of the method can be compensated by running simulations on massively parallel computers. In particular, Graphics Processing Unit acceleration has been found quite effective in reducing computing time of classical trajectory (CT)-DSMC simulations. The aim of the present work is to study dilute molecular oxygen flows by modeling binary collisions, in the rigid rotor approximation, through an accurate Potential Energy Surface (PES), obtained by molecular beams scattering. The PES accuracy is assessed by calculating molecular oxygen transport properties by different equilibrium and non-equilibrium CT-DSMC based simulations that provide close values of the transport properties. Comparisons with available experimental data are presented and discussed in the temperature range 300–900 K, where vibrational degrees of freedom are expected to play a limited (but not always negligible) role.},

These experiments concern phenomena on a spatial scale (101–104 m) intermediate between what is achievable on the ground and the usual solar system plasma observations. Detailed feasibility studies have been performed for three experiments: active magnetic experiments, large-scale discharges and long tether–plasma interactions. The perspectives opened by these experiments are discussed for magnetic reconnection, instabilities, MHD turbulence, atomic excited states kinetics, weakly ionized plasmas, plasma diagnostics, artificial auroras and atmospheric studies.

 abstract = {IntroductionThe research on high-energy shock wave is a field of large interest including nuclear explosion, hypersonic flows as well as laser forming plasmas. During the relevant interaction a high-temperature, high-pressure plasma is formed, which in some cases can be ascribed to the family of thermal plasmas, characterized by equilibrium between the different degrees of freedom, including chemical and internal ones. Thermal plasmas can be described by equilibrium chemical thermodynamics, in particular statistical thermodynamics is used in this field to get information about the input data (entropy, enthalpy and specific heat of single species). Thermal plasmas are usually characterized by a single temperature for all species, including the vibrationally, rotationally and electronically distributions among the excited states, while dissociation and ionization (Saha) equilibria characterize them. On the other hand thermal plasmas with different temperatures are still accepted in this kind of literature, the different temperatures characterizing the corresponding reservoirs of energy. The internal distributions are still Boltzmann at a given (different) temperature; chemical equilibrium thermodynamics again characterizes the plasma properties even though caution must be exercised in using it. Typical conditions for thermal plasmas are temperatures in the range of 5 000-50 000 K, pressure in the 10− 2-103 atm. range and ionization degree larger than 10− 5.},

Thermodynamic functions have been calculated modelling in different ways the electronic levels of atomic species (ground-state, Debye–Hückel and confined-atom approximations). Frozen and reactive specific heats as well as isentropic coefficients are strongly affected by the electronic excitation whereas compensation effects smooth its influence on the total specific heat, i.e. the sum of frozen and reactive contributions. Higher-order approximations of the Chapman–Enskog method have been used to evaluate transport coefficients, including electronically excited states as separate species. The importance of a state-to-state approach to calculate transport coefficients is presented taking into account the strong dependence of transport cross sections on the principal quantum number. Results for hydrogen, nitrogen and air plasmas are widely discussed.},

A wide range of topics is then discussed including (1) the effect of non-equilibrium vibrational distributions on the transport of vibrational energy, (2) the role of electronically excited states in the transport properties of thermal plasmas, (3) the dependence of transport properties on the multitude of Saha equations for multi-temperature plasmas, and (4) the effect of the magnetic field on transport properties. Throughout the book, worked examples are provided to clarify concepts and mathematical approaches.

 abstract = {We investigate the relaxation of internal temperature and the concept of volume viscosity in nonequilibrium gas models derived from the kinetic theory. We first investigate a nonequilibrium gas model with two temperatures—translational and internal—where the volume viscosity is absent. We establish that in a relaxation regime, the temperature difference becomes proportional to the divergence of the velocity fields and define a nonequilibrium, multitemperature, volume viscosity coefficient. We next analyze the convergence of the two temperature model towards the one temperature model when the relaxation is fast. We then investigate a nonequilibrium two temperature gas model with a fast and a slow internal energy mode. We establish that in a relaxation regime, there are four contributions to the volume viscosity, namely, the fast internal mode volume viscosity, the slow internal mode volume viscosity, the relaxation pressure, and the perturbed source term. In the thermodynamic equilibrium limit, the sum of these four terms converges toward the one-temperature two-mode volume viscosity. We finally perform Monte Carlo simulations of spontaneous fluctuations near thermodynamic equilibrium. The numerical results obtained from the Boltzmann equation are compared to the predictions of the one and two temperature fluid models, and the agreement between theory and calculations is complete.},

 abstract = {Coupling DSMC simulations with classical trajectories calculations is emerging as a powerful tool to improve predictive capabilities of computational rarefied gas dynamics. The considerable increase of computational effort outlined in the early application of the method (Koura,1997) can be compensated by running simulations on massively parallel computers. In particular, GPU acceleration has been found quite effective in reducing computing time (Ferrigni,2012; Norman et al.,2013) of DSMC-CT simulations. The aim of the present work is to study rarefied Oxygen flows by modeling binary collisions through an accurate potential energy surface, obtained by molecular beams scattering (Aquilanti, et al.,1999). The accuracy of the method is assessed by calculating molecular Oxygen shear viscosity and heat conductivity following three different DSMC-CT simulation methods. In the first one, transport properties are obtained from DSMC-CT simulations of spontaneous fluctuation of an equilibrium state (Bruno et al, Phys. Fluids, 23, 093104, 2011). In the second method, the collision trajectory calculation is incorporated in a Monte Carlo integration procedure to evaluate the Taxman’s expressions for the transport properties of polyatomic gases (Taxman,1959). In the third, non-equilibrium zero and one-dimensional rarefied gas dynamic simulations are adopted and the transport properties are computed from the non-equilibrium fluxes of momentum and energy. The three methods provide close values of the transport properties, their estimated statistical error not exceeding 3%. The experimental values are slightly underestimated, the percentage deviation being, again, few percent.},

 abstract = {Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) on the SPIDER negative ion source has been collecting data since the beginning of operation in Summer 2018. The first few months were devoted to complete the diagnostic commissioning and its integration with the SPIDER control and data acquisition system. Consistent sets of spectroscopic data have been acquired under different experimental conditions, not only varying the plasma source filling pressure and injected power but also changing the RF generator frequencies and the strength of the magnetic field acting as a filter in front of the plasma grid. The main results of OES data analysis are presented in this work. SPIDER optical emission diagnostic comprises a set of 66 channels wavelength resolved and 36 single line channels by means of interference filtering. Some of them collect the photons along line of sight (LOS) perpendicular to the grids through the 8 RF drivers and others along LOS parallel to and near the grids, both horizontally and vertically. Since the starting of extraction experiments, 22 channels have been dedicated to collect the extracted beam emission. The LOS layout allows tracing two 9-point vertical profiles of the source plasma in the extraction region at 35 and 5 mm from the Plasma Grid (PG) and four 4-point horizontal profiles spanning the 65 mm region before the PG. It is also possible to collect spectra from LOS looking in between the grids. Both Balmer series and Fulcher band between 600 nm and 640 nm were routinely collected. Their intensities are very sensitive to the plasma parameters and when coupled to a collisional radiative model can give an estimation of the electron density and gas dissociation. It has been found that the Balmer emission and gas dissociation inside the drivers scale linearly with the RF power, the latter reaching a value up to 20% at high power and low pressure. Rotational gas temperature has also been evaluated; it ranged between 900 K and 1400 K, where higher values were reached for higher pressures and RF powers.},

 abstract = {To reach fusion conditions and control the plasma configuration in ITER, the next step in tokamak fusion research, two neutral beam injectors (NBIs) will supply 16.5 MW each, by neutralizing accelerated negative hydrogen or deuterium ions. The requirements of ITER NBIs (40A/1 MeV D- ions for ≤1 h, 46A/870 keV H- ions for ≤1000 s) have never been simultaneously attained. So in the Neutral Beam Test Facility (NBTF, Consorzio RFX, Italy) the operation of the full-scale ITER NBI prototype (MITICA) will be tested and optimised up to full performances, focussing on accelerator (including voltage holding), beam optics, neutralisation, residual ion removal. The NBTF includes also the full-scale prototype of the ITER NBI source with 100 keV particle energy (SPIDER), for early investigation of: negative ion production and extraction, source uniformity, negative ion current density and beam optics. This paper will describe the main results of the first two years of SPIDER operation, devoted to characterizing plasma and beam parameters, including investigation of RF-plasma coupling efficiency and magnetic filter field effectiveness in reducing co-extracted electrons. SPIDER is progressing towards the first caesium injection, which aims at increasing the negative ion density. A major shutdown, planned for 2021, to solve the issues identified during the operation and to carry out programmed modifications, will be outlined. The installation of each MITICA power supply and auxiliary system is completed; in-vessel mechanical components are under procurement by Fusion for Energy (F4E). Integration, commissioning and test of the power supplies, procured by F4E and QST, as the Japanese Domestic Agency (JADA), will be presented. In particular, 1.0MV insulating tests were carried out step-by-step and successfully completed. In 2020 integrated tests of the power supplies on the accelerator dummy load started, including the assessment of their resilience to accelerator grid breakdowns using a short-circuit device located in vacuum. The aggressive programme, to validate the NBI design at NBTF and to meet ITER schedule (requiring NBIs in operation in 2032), will be outlined. Unfortunately, in 2020 the coronavirus disease infection affected the NBTF activities. A solution to proceed with integrated power tests despite the coronavirus is presented.},

 abstract = {In the present work, starting from classical MHD scheme, based on Maxwell equations, Euler fluid dynamic equations and generalised Ohm law, a critical study of fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, chemical and physical behaviour of plasma is carried out, and then a aircraft re‐entry MHD numerical scheme is implemented. This scheme is used for MHD calculations in different conditions, in the range of low magnetic force and intermediate electrical conductivity. Initial imposed magnetic fields are uniform, but also some cases with coil generated magnetic fields are considered. Calculations of magnetic field and induced currents are extended also inside the blunt body. Results show interesting physical and electromagnetic effects. Comparison with other methods shows possible development in keeping into account other physical and chemical effects.},

The collision integrals used in the calculations are discussed. The convergence properties of the different approximations are assessed. The degree of anisotropy introduced by the presence of the magnetic field is evaluated. Differences with the isotropic case can be very substantial. The biggest effects are visible at high ionization degrees, i.e. high temperatures, and at strong magnetic fields.},

@article{pub.1141424080,
 abstract = {Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering (RBS) in gases has received considerable attention due to its applications in LIDAR (light detection and ranging) remote sensing and gas property measurements. In most cases, the RBS spectra in the kinetic regime are calculated based on kinetic model equations, which are difficult to be applied to complex gas mixtures. In this work, we employ two widely used molecular simulation methods, i.e., direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) and molecular dynamics (MD), to calculate the spontaneous RBS spectra of binary gas mixtures. We validate these two methods by comparing the simulation results for mixtures of argon and helium with the experimental results. Then we extend the RBS calculations to gas mixtures involving polyatomic gases. The rotational relaxation numbers specific to each species pair in DSMC are determined by fitting the DSMC spectra to the MD spectra. Our results show that all the rotational relaxation numbers for air composed of N_{2} and O_{2} increase with temperature in the range of 300-750 K. We further calculate the RBS spectra for binary mixtures composed of N_{2} and one noble monatomic gas, and the simulation results show that the rotational relaxation of N_{2} is greatly affected by the mass of the noble gas atoms. This work demonstrates that RBS is a promising and alternative way to study the rotational relaxation process in gas mixtures.},

@article{pub.1152934963,
 abstract = {Internal energy relaxation processes in fluid models derived from the kinetic theory are revisited, as are related bulk viscosity coefficients. The apparition of bulk viscosity coefficients in relaxation regimes and the links with equilibrium one-temperature bulk viscosity coefficients are discussed. First, a two-temperature model with a single internal energy mode is investigated, then a two-temperature model with two internal energy modes and finally a state-to-state model for mixtures of gases. All these models lead to a unique physical interpretation of the apparition of bulk viscosity effects when relaxation characteristic times are smaller than fluid times. Monte Carlo numerical simulations of internal energy relaxation processes in model gases are then performed, and power spectrums of density fluctuations are computed. When the energy relaxation time is smaller than the fluid time, both the two temperature and the single-temperature model including bulk viscosity yield a satisfactory description. When the energy relaxation time is larger than the fluid time, however, only the two-temperature model is in agreement with Boltzmann equation. The quantum population of a He-H2 mixture is also simulated with detailed He-H2 cross sections, and the resulting bulk viscosity evaluated from the Green–Kubo formula is in agreement with the theory. The impact of bulk viscosity in fluid mechanics is also addressed, as well as various mathematical aspects of internal energy relaxation and Chapman–Enskog asymptotic expansion for a two-temperature fluid model.},

@article{pub.1154687034,
 abstract = {Spectral line shape models can successfully reproduce experimental Rayleigh-Brillouin spectra, but they need knowledge about the bulk viscosity η<sub>b</sub>. Light scattering involves GHz frequencies, but since η<sub>b</sub> is only documented at low frequencies, η<sub>b</sub> is usually left as a free parameter, which is determined by a fit of the model to an experimental spectrum. The question is whether models work so well because of this freedom. Moreover, for light scattering in air, spectral models view "air" as an effective molecule. We critically evaluate the use of η<sub>b</sub> as a fit parameter by comparing η<sub>b</sub> obtained from fits of the Tenti S6 model to the result of Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) for a mixture of Nitrogen and Oxygen. These simulations are used to compute light scattering spectra, which are then compared to experiments. The DSMC simulation parameters are cross-checked with a molecular dynamics simulation based on intermolecular potentials. At large values of the uniformity parameter y, y ≈ 4, where the Brillouin contribution to spectra is large, fitted η<sub>b</sub> are 20% larger than the ones from DSMC, while the quality of the simulated spectra is comparable to that of the Tenti S6 line shape model. At smaller y, the difference between fitted and simulated η<sub>b</sub> can be as large as 100%. We hypothesize the breakdown of the bulk viscosity concept to be the cause of this fallacy.},
