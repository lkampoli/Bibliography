 abstract = {We present newab initio calculations of the interaction potential and the elastic and inelastic cross sections for He scattering by I2. The electronic structure calculations of the interaction potential are based on an extensive one-electron basis set (triple zeta plus ad set on each I, ans function plus ap set at the I2 bond center, and quadruple zeta plus twop sets on He), a two-configuration-SCF orbital set, and a configuration interaction calculation based on all single and double excitations out of the two-configuration reference space. The calculations are performed at 16He-I2 distances for nine combinations of I2 vibrational displacement and orientation. A new form of analytic representation is presented that is particularly well suited to efficient and accurate fitting ofab initio interaction potentials that include vibrational displacements. Scattering calculations are performed by the vibrational close-coupling, rotational-infinite-order-sudden approximation with a converged vibrational basis.},

 abstract = {Several iterative techniques are applied to solve the non-sparse, indefinite algebraic variational equations of the L2 quantum mechanical description of three-dimensional atom-diatom scattering. We do not assume a symmetric matrix although we employ a symmetric test problem that allows comparison to the standard conjugate gradient algorithm. Convergence of general minimal residual and Lanczos algorithms is shown to be rapid, enabling large savings of computer time as compared to direct methods for large-scale calculations of selected elements or columns of the reactance matrix. As the number M of basis functions varies from 100 to 504, minimal residual calculations based on the Arnoldi basis show very smooth and stable convergence, with computer time scaling as M1.8, and a Lanczos recursive algorithm is found to scale as M1.5 (for off-diagonal matrix elements).},

First, we provide a derivation of the coupled equations for the amplitude densities from the Fock-scheme integrodifferential equations for wavefunction components. Then we discuss the solution of these equations by 2 techniques.

However, experimental determination of NH

 abstract = {A recently developed nonempirical local approximation to the optical potential is applied to electron‐argon scattering. The real part of the optical potential is taken as the sum of static, exchange, and polarization terms and the imaginary part is modeled by using the quasi‐free scattering approximation with Pauli blocking. The main emphasis in the present paper is on the polarization and absorption effects. Three approximations to the polarization potential are used; they are based on an ab initio adiabatic polarization potential, without or with scmiclassical nonadiabatic corrections. The results are compared to existing experimental measurements for the energy range 30–3000 eV. We obtain good agreement with experiment for total and absorption cross sections and for the small‐angle differential cross sections.},

 abstract = {Energy transfer in molecular collisions is a very fundamental problem in chemical physics, both experimentally and theoretically. Quantitative state-to-state cross sections for energy transfer processes are important for understanding and modelling many kinds of systems, including lasers, shocked gases, planetary atmospheres, and systems containing excited reaction products of any kind. In theory these cross sections can be calculated from first principles using quantum mechanics but in practice this involves severe computational difficulties. The first step is the calculation of molecular interaction potentials, which are a consequence of the electronic structure of the interacting molecules for various geometries.There has been enormous progress in this area in the	last few years, 1-3 but we shall not consider it further in this chapter. Instead we shall concentrate on the second step, the dynamical problem that yields the desired inelastic cross sections from the intermolecular potential. Only when both steps have been solved adequately will the ab initio method have reached fruition, but the techniques involved in the two steps are very specialized and to a large extent progress on these steps may occur separately and in parallel. There are two basic approaches to the dynamics problem. First, one can try to develop reliable methods based on simplifying approximations, such as using semiclassical or classical methods or low-order perturbation theory.},

J=0–150 rovibrational levels are computed up to 30,000cm−1, and related transitions are cut off at 1E−42cmmolecule−1 (296K) and 1E−36cmmolecule−1 (1000K). These are the first line lists available to cover reliably the energy region as high as ~20,000cm−1. Recent experimental data at 1.1μm has confirmed the predicted intensities for the 50013-00001 and 50014-00001 band transitions have better than 90% agreement. Comparisons are made against the Wattson 750K line list and HITEMP/HITRAN at 300K, 500K, 725K, 1000K, 1500K, 2000K and 3000K. The temperature dependence and accuracy of the new Ames-296K/1000K line lists are investigated and we claim both line lists are capable of providing reliable opacities up to 18,000–23,000cm−1, while the highest applicable wavenumber range drops as T rises. We suggest caution is used for T>1000K simulations. Comparison to recent experiments at 1000K, 1550K and 1773K shows that the Ames-1000K line list and HITEMP perform similarly in the 3200–3800cm−1 and 4600–5200cm−1 ranges. In the 2000–2100cm−1 range, Ames-1000K yields better agreement relative to experiment. Existing problems and possible future solutions in the new Ames-296K/1000K line lists for line positions and intensities are also discussed.},

 abstract = {A rovibrational collisional coarse-grain model has been developed to reduce a detailed mechanism for the internal energy excitation and dissociation processes behind a strong shockwave in a nitrogen flow. The rovibrational energy levels of the electronic ground state of the nitrogen molecule were lumped into a smaller number of bins. The reaction rate coefficients of an ab initio database developed at NASA Ames Research Center were averaged for each bin based on a uniform distribution of the energy levels within the bin. The results were obtained by coupling the Master equation for the reduced mechanism with a one-dimensional flow solver for conditions expected for reentry into Earth’s atmosphere at 10km/s. The coarse-grain collisional model developed allow us to describe accurately the internal energy relaxation and dissociation processes based on a smaller number of equations, as opposed to existing reduced models assuming thermal equilibrium between the rotational and translational energy modes.},

 abstract = {A new method for the direct calculation of resonance parameters is presented. It is based upon searching for poles of the scattering matrix at complex energies. This search is expedited by the use of analytic derivatives of the scattering matrix with respect to the total energy. This procedure is applied initially to a single channel problem, but is generalizable to more complicated systems. Using the most accurate available potential energy data, we calculate resonance parameters for all of the physically important quasibound states of the ground electronic state of the hydrogen molecule. Corrections to the Born-Oppenheimer potential are included and assessed. The new method has no difficulty locating resonances with widths greater than about 1×10−7 cm−1. It is easier to find narrow resonances by monitoring the dependence of the imaginary part of the reactance matrix on the real part of a complex energy than to monitor the dependence of the eigenphase sum on energy at real energies.},

The line lists are based on J=0–80 rovibrational variational calculations with E′⩽8000cm−1. The 34S16O2 and 33S16O2 line lists are compared to the experiment-based models in the HIgh-resolution TRANsmission molecular absorption database (HITRAN2012, http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hitran/) and the Cologne Database for Molecular Spectroscopy, CDMS (http://www.astro.uni-koeln.de/cdms/). The accuracy for computed 646 band origins is similar to what has been reported for the main isotopologue, i.e. 0.01–0.03cm−1 for bands up to 5500cm−1. For rovibrational transitions, the 646 line position and intensity deviation patterns are much simpler and more self-consistent than those of the main isotopologue 626. The discrepancies are mainly found for higher Ka/J transitions. 626 and 646 exhibit comparable line position and intensity agreement for lower Ka/J transitions. The line position deviations for the 636 purely rotational band are parallel to those of 626 and 646, while its line intensity deviations do not show branching patterns as we found in the 626 and 646 cases. Predictions for the other minor isotopologues are expected to exhibit similar accuracy. These line lists are accurate enough to provide alternatives for missing bands of 626 and the minor isotopologues. It may significantly facilitate the laboratory spectroscopic measurement and analysis, as well as to identify these isotopologues in various astrophysical environments.},

The SO2 628 IR line list is computed on a recently improved potential energy surface (PES) refinement, denoted Ames-Pre2, and the published purely ab initio CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(Q+d)Z dipole moment surface. Progress has been made in both energy level convergence and rovibrational quantum number assignments agreeing with laboratory analysis models. The accuracy of the computed 628 energy levels and line list is similar to what has been achieved and reported for SO2 626 and 646, i.e. 0.01–0.03cm−1 for bands up to 5500cm−1. During the comparison, we found some discrepancies in addition to overall good agreements. The three-IR-list based feature-by-feature analysis in a 0.25cm−1 spectral window clearly demonstrates the power of the current Ames line lists with new assignments, correction of some errors, and intensity contributions from varied sources including other isotopologues. We are inclined to attribute part of detected discrepancies to an incomplete experimental analysis and missing intensity in the model. With complete line position, intensity, and rovibrational quantum numbers determined at 296K, spectroscopic analysis is significantly facilitated especially for a spectral range exhibiting such an unusually high density of lines. The computed 628 rovibrational levels and line list are accurate enough to provide alternatives for the missing bands or suspicious assignments, as well as helpful to identify these isotopologues in various celestial environments. The next step will be to revisit the SO2 828 and 646 spectral analyses.},

For zero total angular momentum we find three quasibound states that lead to enhanced vibrational excitation of the products in the energy range 0.93–1.23 eV; the enhanced vibrational excitation at the lowest-energy resonance coincides with the recent experimental observation by Phillips, Levene, and Valentini that vibrational excitation of the reaction products is more probable at a total energy of 0.94-0.95 eV than at 1.06–1.07 eV, and we show that there is a significant positive contribution of about 12 fs to the delay time associated with this resonance behavior. At higher angular momentum, though, the trend is reversed.},

 abstract = {This paper presents measurements and simulations of CO 4th Positive equilibrium radiation obtained in the NASA Ames Research Center's Electric Arc Shock Tube (EAST) facility. The experiments were aimed at measuring the level of radiation encountered during conditions relevant to high-speed entry into a simulated Martian atmosphere (96% CO2: 4% N2). The facility was configured to target several ranges of nominal Mars entry conditions, of which 7.35km/s at 0.1Torr (13.3Pa), 6.2–8km/s at 0.25Torr (33Pa) and 7.1–7.8km/s at 1Torr (133Pa) are examined in this paper. The CO 4th Positive system was chosen to be the focus of this study as it accounts for a large percentage of the emitted radiation for Martian entry, and also due to the difficulties of obtaining experimental validation data due to the emission appearing in the Vacuum Ultra Violet (VUV) spectral range. The focus of this paper is to provide a comprehensive comparison between the EAST data and various CO 4th Positive databases available in the literature. The analysis endeavors to provide a better understanding of the uncertainty in the measurements and quantifies the level of agreement found between simulations and experimental data. The results of the analysis show that the magnitude of the CO 4th Positive radiative intensity is very sensitive to the flow temperature. Subsequently, simulations using thermodynamic equilibrium generally under-predict the experimental data by approximately a factor of up to 2. However, when simulations are performed using a flow temperature extracted from the black body limited portion of the CO 4th Positive spectra taken from experiment, the agreement between the EAST data and simulations is generally very good. Furthermore, comparisons of experimental data and simulations across other spectral regions provide additional support for the use of the black body temperature.},

 abstract = {The HDO absorption spectrum was recorded in the 13 165-13 500 cm(-1) spectral region by intracavity laser absorption spectroscopy. The spectrum (615 lines), dominated by the 2nu(2) + 3nu(3) and nu(1) + 3nu(3) bands, was assigned and modeled leading to the derivation of 196 accurate energy levels of the (103) and (023) vibrational states. Finally, 150 of these levels were reproduced by an effective Hamiltonian involving two vibrational dark states interacting with the (023) and (103) bright states. The rms deviation achieved by variation of 28 parameters is 0.05 cm(-1), compared to an averaged experimental uncertainty of 0.007 cm(-1), indicating the limit of validity of the effective Hamiltonian approach for HDO at high-vibrational excitation. The predictions of previous ab initio calculations of the HDO spectrum (H. Partridge and D. Schwenke, J. Chem. Phys. 106, 4618-4639 (1997)) were extensively used in the assignment process. The particular spectral region under consideration was used to test and discuss the improvements of new ab initio calculations recently performed on the basis of the same potential energy surface but with an improved dipole-moment surface. The improvements concern both the energy levels and the line intensities. In particular, the strong hybrid character of the nu(1) + 3nu(3) band is very well accounted for by the new ab initio calculations. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

 abstract = {One of the most exciting developments in theoretical chemistry in the last few years has been the production of ab initio potential energy surfaces by electronic structure calculations and the use of these surfaces for dynamics calculations. With accurate enough surfaces, these dynamics calculations may yield results that rival the accuracy attainable experimentally. When that is achieved one also benefits from the extra detail available in the theoretical output. For example, the theoretical results may include interesting information about the dependence of cross sections on initial vibrational states in cases where only the initial translational energy has been experimentally varied, or they may yield product rotational distributions in cases where the experimental product-state resolution is only sufficient to distinguish vibrational structure. In other cases, theoretical rates may be calculated for systems on which no experiments have been performed. An even more dramatic example is the ability of theory to provide opacity functions, which are transition probabilities as functions of impact parameter. These functions are absolutely unattainable experimentally.},

The line positions and intensities were retrieved by fitting individual spectra based on a Voigt line shape profile and then averaging the values to form the experimental linelist. The integrated intensity of the region was 4.68×10−19 cm−1/(molecule·cm−2) at 296K. Empirical lower state energies were also estimated for 3567 absorption line features using line intensities retrieved from 10 spectra recorded at gas temperature between 185 and 233K. Finally, using Ground State Combination Differences (GSCDs) and the empirical lower state energy estimates, the quantum assignments were determined for 1096 transitions in the room temperature linelist, along with empirical upper state energies for 434 levels. The assignments correspond to seven vibrational states, as confirmed from recent ab initio calculations. The resulting composite database of 14NH3 line parameters will provide experimental constraints to ab initio calculations and support remote sensing of gaseous bodies including the atmospheres of Earth, (exo)planets, brown dwarfs, and other astrophysical environments.},

 abstract = {The advent of supercomputers has had a profound influence on the development of computational chemistry in the last decade. Any increase in computing power from a given level will, of course, increase the range and size of problems that can be studied, but the influence of supercomputers goes much deeper than this. The need to develop new algorithms to exploit supercomputers fully affects formal mathematical aspects of computational chemistry methodology, while in some areas the ability to perform calculations at new levels of accuracy or on new chemical systems can alter entire computational chemistry strategies. In the present review, our goal is to show how the supercomputers produced by Cray Research, Inc. (CRI) have influenced two areas of computational chemistry—molecular electronic structure and dynamics calculations. We shall discuss aspects of performance and programming for a range of Cray computers, and show how these factors have influenced the methodology and implementation in these

Three IR lists are available for each istotopologue: a complete list at 296K, a reduced-size list at 296K, plus a reduced-size list at 1000K. They are denoted Ames-296K, Ames-296K.reduced and Ames-1000K.reduced. With J up to 150, and energy up to 18,000cm−1 above the zero point energy, these lists are expected to cover the temperature range up to 1500K. Line shape parameters including temperature dependence are calculated and reported for four temperature ranges: Mars, Earth, Venus, and Hotter (700–2000K). Comparisons are made against the available transition data in the HITRAN2012 models. Line position accuracy for most transitions up to 10,000–13,000cm−1 is better than 0.03–0.05cm−1. Computed transition intensities agree well with most HITRAN data but there exist suspicious exceptions for isotopologues. These line lists will expedite CO2 IR experimental data analysis and provide the scientific community with trustworthy alternatives for unknown IR bands. These line lists may be combined with existing experimental databases to facilitate the analysis of future laboratory experiments or astronomical observations.},

State-to-state delay times are also calculated and are used to test for the occurrence of resonances. We find that the ν′=3 HF product vibrational state has no delay in its threshold compared to ν′=2. Furthermore, no resonance structure is observed in the time delays for orbital angular momentum l=0. Both findings are consistent with experiment. The ν′=3 probability is higher than that for ν′=2 for initial l=0, but the ratio decreases for higher l.},

In this paper we consider further strategies for improving the algorithm to allow even more demanding applications. In this context, improvement means that equivalent results can be obtained using fewer computational resources (computer time or storage) or that an equivalent expenditure of resources can yield higher accuracy. The new strategies discussed here lead to improvement in both of these areas. Two areas of special focus in the present paper are (i) the finite difference boundary value method used for calculating distorted wave Green's functions and regular solutions for scattering by the distortion potential and (ii) the choice of the distortion potential itself. Among other results included here is the first application of the outgoing wave or scattered wave variational principle to reactive scattering.},

@article{pub.1053316697,
 abstract = {It is well known that the convergence of correlation energies in atomic and molecular calculations is relatively slow and that calculations aimed at high accuracy must explicitly make corrections for this. In this work we consider 1e − basis set extrapolation as a means of obtaining high accuracy. The correlation consistent basis sets of Dunning et al. have provided a convenient platform for extrapolation, with the independent variable being X = D, T, Q, 5, … . There has been much debate in the literature about the functional form to use for the extrapolation, with contention between the ‘theoretically justified’ (X + 1)−3 form and empirical forms based on exponentials or variable powers. We will dissect the theoretical justification of the (X + 1)−3 form by considering MP2 calculations on He and Ne as a function of the maximum angular momentum (⪙) in the basis using basis sets having converged radial extent. Calculations with ⪙ up to 14 were carried out for Ne. It is shown that while the asymptotic form of (⪙ + 1)−3 is clearly reached, higher order terms are very important in the range of ⪙ normally used in molecular calculations. We also use similar analysis techniques for an open shell atom and a small molecule. The functional form for the dependence of molecular properties with ⪙ is complex and it is safer to extrapolate fitting parameters than energies.},

 abstract = {It is customary when computing ro−vibrational transitions in molecules to invoke the Born−Oppenheimer separation between nuclear and electronic motion. However, it is known from accurate calculations on H2 + and H2 that the first-order (diagonal adiabatic) and second-order (nonadiabatic) corrections are not negligible and are both important. In the present work, we have made an ab initio implementation of the Bunker and Moss formalism for the nonadiabatic correction and applied it to H2 and H2O. From comparison to accurate calculations for H2, we find that we can obtain good results for the nonadiabatic correction using CI singles to treat the electronically excited states if we scale the results, but we must go beyond the SCF approximation to obtain an accurate diagonal adiabatic correction. For H2O, we find that the first-order correction is more important than the second-order correction for bending energy levels, but the second-order correction is more important than the first-order correction for stretching energy levels. The correction to rotational levels is also significant. Thus, first- and second-order corrections are vital for accurate ab initio predictions of transition frequencies.},

 abstract = {In a recent letter (J. Phys. Chem. A, 2001, 105,1), we argued that, although all major thermochemical tables recommend a value of (OH) based on a spectroscopic approach, the correct value is 0.5 kcal/mol lower as determined from an ion cycle. In this paper, we expand upon and augment both the experimental and theoretical arguments presented in the letter. In particular, three separate experiments (mass-selected photoionization measurements, pulsed-field-ionization photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, and photoelectron-photoion coincidence measurements) utilizing the positive ion cycle to derive the O−H bond energy are shown to converge to a consensus value of the appearance energy AE0(OH+/H2O) = 146117 ± 24 cm-1 (18.1162 ± 0.0030 eV). With the most accurate currently available zero kinetic energy photoionization value for the ionization energy IE(OH) = 104989 ± 2 cm-1, corroborated by a number of photoelectron measurements, this leads to D 0(H−OH) = 41128 ± 24 cm-1 = 117.59 ± 0.07 kcal/mol. This corresponds to ΔH f0(OH) = 8.85 ± 0.07 kcal/mol and implies D 0(OH) = 35593 ± 24 cm-1 = 101.76 ± 0.07 kcal/mol. These results are completely supported by the most sophisticated theoretical calculations ever performed on the H x O system, CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVnZ, n = Q, 5, 6, and 7, extrapolated to the CBS limit and including corrections for core-valence effects, scalar relativistic effects, incomplete correlation recovery, and diagonal Born−Oppenheimer corrections. These calculations have an estimated theoretical error of ≤0.2 kcal/mol based on basis set convergence properties. They reproduce the experimental results for dissociation energies, atomization energies, and ionization energies for the H x O system to within 0.0−0.2 kcal/mol. In contrast, the previously accepted values of the two successive bond dissociation energies of water differ from the current values by 0.5 kcal/mol. These values were derived from the spectroscopic determinations of D 0(OH) using a very short Birge−Sponer extrapolation on OH/OD AΣ+. However, on the basis of a calculation of the A state potential energy curve (with a multireference single and double excitation wave function and an aug-cc-pV5Z basis set) and an exhaustive reanalyzis of the original measured data on both the A and B states of OH, the Birge−Sponer extrapolation can be demonstrated to significantly underestimate the bond dissociation energy, although only the last vibrational level was not observed experimentally. The recommended values of this paper affect a large number of other thermochemical quantities which directly or indirectly rely on or refer to D 0(H−OH), D 0(OH), or . This is illustrated by an analysis of several reaction enthalpies, deprotonation enthalpies, and proton affinities.},

These results were then fit to a functional form that permits calculation of the BODC for any combination of isotopes. Mean unsigned fitting errors on a test grid of configurations not included in the fitting process were 0.14, 0.12, and 0.65 cm(-1) for the H(3), DH(2), and MuH(2) isotopomers, respectively. This representation can be combined with any Born-Oppenheimer potential energy surface (PES) to yield Born-Huang (BH) PESs; herein, we choose the CCI potential energy surface, the uncertainties of which ( approximately 0.01 kcal/mol) are much smaller than the magnitude of the BODC. Fortran routines to evaluate these BH surfaces are provided. Variational transition state theory calculations are presented comparing thermal rate constants for reactions on the BO and BH surfaces to provide an initial estimate of the significance of the diagonal correction for the dynamics.},

 abstract = {A new approach is proposed and investigated for approximately including the effects of diffuse functions in one-particle basis sets when high accuracy is desired. The method is cost-effective for use in computing quartic force fields (QFFs), global potential energy surfaces (PESs), or other situations when a large part of the PES is needed. It is conservatively estimated that the use of this approximation leads to a computational savings of a factor of five, and it is argued that this could be significantly larger if input/output wait times are considered. It can be used when extrapolation to the one-particle basis set limit is performed, or it can be used simply to approximate the effect of diffuse functions for a larger basis set. The new approach is based on scaling the diffuse function effect for a smaller basis set to approximate the effect for a larger basis or an extrapolated energy in which larger basis set(s) are used. The scale factor is written as a function of the geometrical coordinates of the molecule and thus it includes a geometry dependence. We report results where the scale factor is a constant, includes through gradient terms, includes through second derivative terms, and includes through diagonal second and third derivative terms. The method has been tested in the calculation of accurate QFFs, equilibrium structures, and harmonic and fundamental vibrational frequencies for NH(2)(-), OH(-), H(2)O, and CH(3)OH. It is found that including up through diagonal second derivative terms leads to reliable fundamental vibrational frequencies and is cost-effective. It is also concluded that the use of a 5Z-quality basis set is essential if high accuracy is desired for these properties, even with extrapolation to the one-particle basis set limit.},

An angular basis is proposed whereby the rotational−bending contraction takes place in three steps.

 abstract = {This paper presents the first test of the popular trajectory surface-hopping (TSH) method against accurate three-dimensional quantum mechanics for a reactive system. The system considered is a model system in which an excited atom with an excitation energy of 0.76 eV reacts with or is quenched by the H2 molecule. The electronically nonadiabatic collisions occur primarily near a conical intersection of an exciplex with a repulsive ground state. The accurate quantal results are calculated using the outgoing wave variational principle in an electronically diabatic representation. Four variants of the TSH method are tested, differing in the criteria for hopping and the component of momentum that is adjusted in order to conserve energy when a hop occurs. Coupling between the ground and excited surface occurs primarily in the vicinity of a conical intersection and is mediated by an exciplex found on the upper surface. We find that the overall TSH quenching probabilities are in good agreement with quantum mechanical results, but the branching ratios between reactive and nonreactive trajectories and many of the state-selected results are poorly reproduced by trajectory calculations. The agreement between trajectory surface hopping and quantal results is on average worse for the relatively more “quantum mechanical” j = 0 initial state and M + H2 quenching process and better for the relatively more “classical” j = 2 initial state and MH + H‘ reactive process. We also perform a statistical calculation of overall quenching probability and unimolecular rate of the nonadiabatic decay of the exciplex. We find that only about 10 % of trajectories can be described as “statistical” and that statistical calculation overestimates the total quenching rate significantly.},

 abstract = {This paper discusses converged quantum mechanical scattering calculations for the reaction Cl + H2 → HCl + H and its reverse and analyzes them for the properties of quantized dynamical bottlenecks controlling the total and state-specific microcanonical-ensemble rate constants. These rate constants show clear evidence for quantized transition states. We assign bend and stretch quantum numbers to the transition states for total angular momentum J = 0 with parity P = +1, for J = 1 with P = +1 and −1, and for J = 2 and 6 with P = +1. Then, state-specific densities of reactive states (transition state spectra) are examined to obtain a detailed picture of the reaction. A quantal estimate of the rotational constant, B, for several different transition states is obtained by comparing transition state energies at different values of the total angular momentum. These quantal estimates are in good agreement with the values calculated from the moments of inertia, and this enables us to interpret the results in terms of state-dependent geometries for the individual dynamical bottlenecks. By treating the transition states as poles in the scattering matrix, we also obtain estimates for the lifetimes of the states. The JP-specific rate coefficients, the reactant-state-specific rate coefficients, and the contribution from each transition state to the JP-specific and the reactant-state-specified rate coefficient are also calculated and the trends analyzed. These trends help explain the dependence of the rate coefficient on initial vibrational and rotational quantum numbers.},

The total widths determine the lifetimes, and the partial widths determine the branching probabilities for competing decay mechanisms. We compare the quantum mechanical calculations of the resonance lifetimes and the average final vibrational and rotational quantum numbers of the decay product, H2(ν‘, j‘), to trajectory surface hopping calculations carried out by various prescriptions for the hopping event. Tully's fewest switches algorithm is used for the trajectory surface hopping calculations, and we present a new strategy for adaptive stepsize control that dramatically improves the convergence of the numerical propagation of the solution of the coupled classical and quantum mechanical differential equations. We performed the trajectory surface hopping calculations with four prescriptions for the hopping vector that is used for adjusting the momentum at hopping events. These include changing the momentum along the nonadiabatic coupling vector (d), along the gradient of the difference in the adiabatic energies of the two states (g), and along two new vectors that we describe as the rotated-d and the rotated-g vectors. We show that the dynamics obtained from the d and g prescriptions are significantly different from each other, and we show that the d prescription agrees better with the quantum results. The results of the rotated methods show systematic deviations from the nonrotated results, and in general, the error of the nonrotated methods is smaller. The nonrotated TFS-d method is thus the most accurate method for this system, which was selected for detailed study precisely because it is more sensitive to the choice of hopping vector than previously studied systems.},

These exciplexes decay to the ground state, X̃ 2A1, by a surface crossing in C 2 v geometry. The quantum mechanical lifetimes and the branching probabilities for competing decay mechanisms are computed for two different NaH2 potential energy matrices, and we explain the results in terms of features of the potential energy matrices. We compare the quantum mechanical calculations of the lifetimes and the average vibrational and rotational quantum numbers of the decay product, H2, to two kinds of semiclassical trajectory calculations: the trajectory surface hopping method and the Ehrenfest self-consistent potential method (also called the time-dependent self-consistent field method). The trajectory surface hopping calculations use Tully's fewest switches algorithm and two different prescriptions for adjusting the momentum during a hop. Both the adiabatic and the diabatic representations are used for the trajectory surface hopping calculations. We show that the diabatic surface hopping calculations agree better with the quantum mechanical calculations than the adiabatic surface hopping calculations or the Ehrenfest calculations do for one potential energy matrix, and the adiabatic surface hopping calculations agree best with the quantum mechanical calculations for the other potential energy matrix. We test three criteria for predicting which representation is most accurate for surface hopping calculations. We compare the ability of the semiclassical methods to accurately reproduce the quantum mechanical trends between the two potential matrices, and we review other recent comparisons of semiclassical and quantum mechanical calculations for a variety of potential matrices. On the basis of the evidence so far accumulated, we conclude that for general three-dimensional two-state systems, Tully's fewest switches method is the most accurate semiclassical method currently available if (i) one uses the nonadiabatic coupling vector as the hopping vector and (ii) one propagates the trajectories in the representation that minimizes the number of surface hops.},

The reactive flux arrives at the dividing surface in the asymptotic product region in a series of six packets, instead of a single packet. Further study shows that these features arise from the "Lake Eyring" region of the PES, a region with a shallow well between two transition states. Trappings due to Feshbach resonances are found to be the major cause of the time delay. A detailed analysis of the Feshbach resonance features is carried out using an L(2) calculation of the metastable states in the "Lake Eyring" region. Strong resonance features are found in the state-to-state and initial state selected reaction probabilities. The metastable states with bending motions and/or bending coupled with stretching motions are found to be the predominant source of the resonance structure. Initial state selected reaction probabilities further indicate that the lifetimes of the metastable states with bending motions in the "Lake Eyring" region are longer than those of states with stretching motions and thus dominate the reactive resonances. Resonance structures are also visible in some of the integral cross sections and should provide a means for future experimental observation of the resonance behavior. A study of the final rotational distributions shows that, for the energy range studied here, the final products are distributed toward high-rotational states. Final vibrational distributions at the temperatures 2000 and 10,000 K are also reported.},

 abstract = {A global potential energy surface (PES) that includes short and long range terms has been determined for the NH(3) molecule. The singles and doubles coupled-cluster method that includes a perturbational estimate of connected triple excitations and the internally contracted averaged coupled-pair functional electronic structure methods have been used in conjunction with very large correlation-consistent basis sets, including diffuse functions. Extrapolation to the one-particle basis set limit was performed and core correlation and scalar relativistic contributions were included directly, while the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction was added. Our best purely ab initio PES, denoted "mixed," is constructed from two PESs which differ in whether the ic-ACPF higher-order correlation correction was added or not. Rovibrational transition energies computed from the mixed PES agree well with experiment and the best previous theoretical studies, but most importantly the quality does not deteriorate even up to 10 300 cm(-1) above the zero-point energy (ZPE). The mixed PES was improved further by empirical refinement using the most reliable J=0-2 rovibrational transitions in the HITRAN 2004 database. Agreement between high-resolution experiment and rovibrational transition energies computed from our refined PES for J=0-6 is excellent. Indeed, the root mean square (rms) error for 13 HITRAN 2004 bands for J=0-2 is 0.023 cm(-1) and that for each band is always <or=0.06 cm(-1). For J=3-5 the rms error is always <or=0.15 cm(-1). This agreement means that transition energies computed with our refined PES should be useful in the assignment of new high-resolution NH(3) spectra and in correcting mistakes in previous assignments. Ideas for further improvements to our refined PES and for extension to other isotopolog are discussed.},

@article{pub.1057970755,
 abstract = {In this work, we build upon our previous work on the theoretical spectroscopy of ammonia, NH(3). Compared to our 2008 study, we include more physics in our rovibrational calculations and more experimental data in the refinement procedure, and these enable us to produce a potential energy surface (PES) of unprecedented accuracy. We call this the HSL-2 PES. The additional physics we include is a second-order correction for the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, and we find it to be critical for improved results. By including experimental data for higher rotational levels in the refinement procedure, we were able to greatly reduce our systematic errors for the rotational dependence of our predictions. These additions together lead to a significantly improved total angular momentum (J) dependence in our computed rovibrational energies. The root-mean-square error between our predictions using the HSL-2 PES and the reliable energy levels from the HITRAN database for J = 0-6 and J = 7∕8 for (14)NH(3) is only 0.015 cm(-1) and 0.020∕0.023 cm(-1), respectively. The root-mean-square errors for the characteristic inversion splittings are approximately 1∕3 smaller than those for energy levels. The root-mean-square error for the 6002 J = 0-8 transition energies is 0.020 cm(-1). Overall, for J = 0-8, the spectroscopic data computed with HSL-2 is roughly an order of magnitude more accurate relative to our previous best ammonia PES (denoted HSL-1). These impressive numbers are eclipsed only by the root-mean-square error between our predictions for purely rotational transition energies of (15)NH(3) and the highly accurate Cologne database (CDMS): 0.00034 cm(-1) (10 MHz), in other words, 2 orders of magnitude smaller. In addition, we identify a deficiency in the (15)NH(3) energy levels determined from a model of the experimental data.},

 abstract = {Several aspects of ammonia rovibrational spectra have been investigated using the new HSL-2 potential energy surface that includes an approximate correction for nonadiabatic effects. The unprecedented accuracy of rovibrational energy levels and transition energies computed using HSL-2 was demonstrated in Part I of this study. For (14)NH(3), new assignments for a few ν(3) + ν(4) band transitions and energy levels are suggested, and discrepancies between computed and HITRAN energy levels in the 2ν(4) band are analyzed (2ν(4) is the most difficult band below 5000 cm(-1)). New assignments are suggested for existing or missing 2ν(4) levels. Several new vibrational bands are identified from existing, unassigned HITRAN data, including 2ν(2) + ν(4), (ν(3) + ν(4)) -A(')∕A("), ν(1) + 2ν(2), and 2ν(2) + 2ν(4). The strong mixing between the 2ν(4) and 2ν(2) + ν(4) bands is carefully examined and found to be the source of the difficulties in the experimental modeling of 2ν(4). Discussion is presented for preliminary J = 10 results, where the overall root-mean-square error is estimated to be less than 0.039 cm(-1). The analysis of the 4ν(2) band demonstrates both the reliability and the accuracy of predictions from HSL-2. The full list of computed J = 0 band origins (with assignments) and the inversion splittings up to 7000-8000 cm(-1) above the zero-point energy are presented. J = 0-2 levels are reported for those bands below 5100 cm(-1) that are missing from the HITRAN database. For (15)NH(3), excellent agreement is found for the available ν(2) and ν(3) + ν(4)(E) transition energies, but significant deficiencies are shown for HITRAN levels and several corrections are suggested. The (15)N isotopic effects are presented for the J = 0-6 levels of 13 HITRAN bands. For (14)ND(3), we reproduce the pure rotational inversion spectra line frequencies with an accuracy similar to that for (14)NH(3). However, it is not possible to reproduce simultaneously all four pairs of inversion-split vibrational fundamentals to better than 0.05 cm(-1) uncertainty. It is suggested that a reanalysis of some suspicious (14)ND(3) fundamental bands is required. The analyses presented here and in Part I show that rovibrational energy levels and transition frequencies computed with HSL-2 (with nonadiabatic corrections) remain highly accurate well beyond the experimental data used in the refinement procedure. Calculations using HSL-2 are capable of revealing many deficiencies in experimental analyses of ammonia spectra and provide reliable predictions with similar accuracy. It is expected that the results of this study will be useful in the future interpretation of high-resolution spectra from laboratory experiments or from astronomical observations. The present work represents a very significant advance in the state of our knowledge of the spectroscopy of ammonia and its isotopologues.},

 abstract = {An isotopic-independent, highly accurate potential energy surface (PES) has been determined for CO(2) by refining a purely ab initio PES with selected, purely experimentally determined rovibrational energy levels. The purely ab initio PES is denoted Ames-0, while the refined PES is denoted Ames-1. Detailed tests are performed to demonstrate the spectroscopic accuracy of the Ames-1 PES. It is shown that Ames-1 yields σ(rms) (root-mean-squares error) = 0.0156 cm(-1) for 6873 J = 0-117 (12)C(16)O(2) experimental energy levels, even though less than 500 (12)C(16)O(2) energy levels were included in the refinement procedure. It is also demonstrated that, without any additional refinement, Ames-1 yields very good agreement for isotopologues. Specifically, for the (12)C(16)O(2) and (13)C(16)O(2) isotopologues, spectroscopic constants G(v) computed from Ames-1 are within ±0.01 and 0.02 cm(-1) of reliable experimentally derived values, while for the (16)O(12)C(18)O, (16)O(12)C(17)O, (16)O(13)C(18)O, (16)O(13)C(17)O, (12)C(18)O(2), (17)O(12)C(18)O, (12)C(17)O(2), (13)C(18)O(2), (13)C(17)O(2), (17)O(13)C(18)O, and (14)C(16)O(2) isotopologues, the differences are between ±0.10 and 0.15 cm(-1). To our knowledge, this is the first time a polyatomic PES has been refined using such high J values, and this has led to new challenges in the refinement procedure. An initial high quality, purely ab initio dipole moment surface (DMS) is constructed and used to generate a 296 K line list. For most bands, experimental IR intensities are well reproduced for (12)C(16)O(2) using Ames-1 and the DMS. For more than 80% of the bands, the experimental intensities are reproduced with σ(rms)(ΔI) < 20% or σ(rms)(ΔI∕δ(obs)) < 5. A few exceptions are analyzed and discussed. Directions for future improvements are discussed, though it is concluded that the current Ames-1 and the DMS should be useful in analyzing and assigning high-resolution laboratory or astronomical spectra.},

 abstract = {Theoretical spectroscopic constants are reported for the A′ 5Σ+g and C″ 5Πu states of N2 based on CASSCF/MRCI calculations employing large ANO Gaussian basis sets. Our calculated A′ 5Σ+g potential differs qualitatively from previous calculations in that the inner well is significantly deeper (De ≊3450 cm−1). The potential also has a substantial barrier (≊500 cm−1) to dissociation with a maximum near 4.3 a0, and then a shallow (≊47 cm−1) van der Waals minimum near 6.3 a0. We suggest that it is the v=4 and v=5 levels that are involved in predissociating the a 1Πg and B 3Πg states, as opposed to v=0 and v=1 proposed by Verma. The deeper well in the A′ 5Σ+g state provides considerable support for the theory of Berkowitz, Chupka, and Kistiakowsky who proposed that A′ 5Σ+g is the primary precursor state involved in the yellow Lewis–Rayleigh afterglow of nitrogen. The theoretical De for the C″ 5Πu state is also much larger than previous estimates. The previously unassigned Hermann infrared system (HIR) band positions correspond exceptionally well to our theoretical values for the C″ 5Πu →A′ 5Σ+g transition. This and other considerations lead to a rather convincing assignment of this transition as the HIR system. Einstein coefficients and radiative lifetimes are presented for this transition. Since the natural radiative lifetime of this state is much longer than experimental estimates, the C″ 5Πu state may derive its actual lifetime through interaction with the C 3Πu state.},

These and previous ab initio calculations are then fit to a new analytic representation which is designed to be efficient to evaluate and to provide an especially faithful account of the forces along the vibrational coordinates. We use the new potential for two sets of quantal scattering calculations for collisions in three dimensions with total angular momentum zero. First we test that the angular harmonic representation of the anisotropy is adequate by comparing quantal rigid rotator calculations to those carried out for potentials involving higher angular harmonics and for which the expansion in angular harmonics is systematically increased to convergence. Then we carry out large-scale quantal calculations of vibration–vibration energy transfer including the coupling of both sets of vibrational and rotational coordinates. These calculations indicate that significant rotational energy transfer accompanies the vibration-to-vibration energy transfer process.},

 abstract = {A complex GMRes (generalized minimum residual) algorithm is presented and used to solve dense systems of linear equations arising in variational basis-set approaches to quantum-mechanical reactive scattering. The examples presented correspond to physical solutions of the Schrödinger equation for the reactions O+HD→OH+D, D+H2→HD+H, and H+H2→H2+H. It is shown that the computational effort for solution with GMRes depends upon both the dimension of the linear system and the total energy of the reaction. In several cases with dimensions in the range 1110–5632, GMRes outperforms the LAPACK direct solver, with speedups for the linear equation solution as large as a factor of 23. In other cases, the iterative algorithm does not converge within a reasonable time. These convergence differences can be correlated with ‘‘indices of diagonal dominance,’’ which we define in detail and which are relatively easy to compute. Furthermore, we find that for a given energy, the computational effort for GMRes can vary with dimension as favorably as M1.7, where M is the dimension of the linear system, whereas the computer time for a direct method is approximately proportional to the cube of the dimension of the linear system.},

The one-particle Gaussian basis sets ranged in quality from F[6s4p2d], Cl[10s7p2d], and H[4s2p] to F[18s13p6d4f], Cl[20s14p7d5f], and H[8s3p2d1f]. The first phase of the investigation focused on the prediction of thermochemical, spectroscopic, and bonding properties of [FHCl]− and the chemical interpretation thereof. The final proposals for the geometric structure and binding energy of the complex are re(H–F)=0.963±0.003 Å, Re(H–Cl)=1.925±0.015 Å, and D0(HF+Cl−)=21.8±0.4 kcal mol−1. A Morokuma decomposition of the ion-molecule bonding gave the following electrostatic (ES), polarization (PL), exchange repulsion (EX), dispersion (DISP), and charge-transfer plus higher-order mixing (CT+MIX) components of the vibrationless complexation energy: −27.3 (ES), −5.2 (PL), +18.3 (EX), −4.5 (DISP), and −5.0 (CT+MIX) kcal mol−1. The second phase of the work involved the construction of a CCSD global surface from 208 and 228 energy points for linear and bent conformations, respectively, these being fit to rms errors of only 3.9 and 9.3 cm−1, respectively, below 8000 cm−1. The surface was represented by a flexible analytic form which reproduces the quartic force field at equilibrium, exhibits the proper asymptotic properties, and is generally applicable to ion-molecule systems. The final phase of the study entailed the determination of converged J=0 and J=1 variational eigenstates of the [FHCl]− surface to near the HF+Cl− dissociation threshold by employing Jacobi coordinates and vibrational configuration interaction expansions in terms of natural modals. The fundamental vibrational frequencies given by the analysis were ν1=247, ν2=876, and ν3=2884 cm−1. The complete vibrational eigenspectrum was then analyzed in terms of several contemporary dynamical issues, including vibrational adiabaticity, anharmonic resonances, densities of high-lying states, and signatures of quantum ergodicity.},

 abstract = {Two approaches, the outgoing wave variational principle (OWVP) and R-matrix propagation (RMProp), are presented for quantum dynamics calculations of inelastic scattering in systems involving two coupled potential energy surfaces (PES). The two formalisms are applied to Na(3p 2P) collisions with H2 at a total energy of 2.426 eV with zero and unit total angular momentum. This provides a challenging test case because the accessible region of the excited-state potential energy surface intersects the ground-state surface conically and involves H–H internuclear distances that are far larger than their equilibrium values in the ground state. We present the details of the formalisms for treating coupled surfaces, and we present converged results for the quenching probability and final vibrational–rotational quantum state distributions of the quenching agent. Convergence of the transition probabilities is established by convergence checks within each formalism, by obtaining the same results with laboratory-frame and body-frame basis functions in the OWVP formalism, and by obtaining the same results with the OWVP as with RMProp.},

Improved harmonic frequencies were determined with the cc-pVQZ basis set. Fundamental vibrational frequencies were determined using a second-order perturbation theory analysis and also using variational calculations. The N–O stretch and bending fundamentals are determined well from both vibrational analyses. The H–N stretch, however, is shown to have an unusually large anharmonic correction, and is not well determined using second-order perturbation theory. The H–N fundamental is well determined from the variational calculations, demonstrating the quality of the ab initio quartic force field. The zero-point energy of HNO that should be used in isodesmic reactions is also discussed.},

The effect of core correlation and further basis set extension has been investigated. Vibrational energy levels have been obtained using perturbation theory and two different variational approaches. A severe Fermi resonance exists between the most intense vibration, ν6, and ν3+ν5 through an exceptionally large k356=−258.2 cm−1; a large k1356 =−54.8 cm−1 causes significant higher-order anharmonicity, including a shift in ν6 of +9 cm−1. C4 appears to be an excellent test case for methods for solving the vibrational Schrödinger equation, since perturbation theory breaks down even when the above resonances are accounted for. Our best estimate for ν6, 1320±10 cm−1, may suggest its assignment to a feature detected at 1284 cm−1 in argon and 1302 cm−1 in krypton matrix, but this would imply an unusually large matrix red shift in argon.},

Two versions of the method, one including electronic coherence between hops and one neglecting this effect, are applied to the electronically nonadiabatic quenching processes Na(3p)+H2(v=0,j=0 or 2)→Na(3s)+H2(v′,j′). They are found to agree well, not only for quenching probabilities and final-state distributions, but also for collision lifetimes and hopping statistics, demonstrating that electronic coherence is not important for this system. In general the accurate quantum dynamical calculations and both semiclassical surface hopping models agree well on the average, which lends credence to applications of semiclassical methods to provide insight into the mechanistic details of photochemical processes proceeding on coupled potential surfaces. In the second part of the paper the intimate details of the trajectories are analyzed to provide such insight for the present electronic-to-vibrational energy transfer process.},

This PES is empirically adjusted to improve the agreement between the computed line positions and those from the HITRAN 92 data base with J⩽5 for H216O. The changes in the PES are small, nonetheless including an estimate of core (oxygen 1s) electron correlation greatly improves the agreement with the experiment. Using this adjusted PES, we can match 30 092 of the 30 117 transitions in the HITRAN 96 data base for H216O with theoretical lines. The 10, 25, 50, 75, and 90 percentiles of the difference between the calculated and tabulated line positions are −0.11, −0.04, −0.01, 0.02, and 0.07 cm−1. Nonadiabatic effects are not explicitly included. About 3% of the tabulated line positions appear to be incorrect. Similar agreement using this adjusted PES is obtained for the 17O and 18O isotopes. For HD16O, the agreement is not as good, with a root-mean-square error of 0.25 cm−1 for lines with J⩽5. This error is reduced to 0.02 cm−1 by including a small asymmetric correction to the PES, which is parameterized by simultaneously fitting to HD16O and D216O data. Scaling this correction by mass factors yields good results for T2O and HTO. The intensities summed over vibrational bands are usually in good agreement between the calculations and the tabulated results, but individual line strengths can differ greatly. A high-temperature list consisting of 307 721 352 lines is generated for H216O using our PES and dipole moment function.},

 abstract = {A rovibrational collisional model is developed to study energy transfer and dissociation of N(2)((1)Σ(g)(+)) molecules interacting with N((4)S(u)) atoms in an ideal isochoric and isothermal chemical reactor. The system examined is a mixture of molecular nitrogen and a small amount of atomic nitrogen. This mixture, initially at room temperature, is heated by several thousands of degrees Kelvin, driving the system toward a strong non-equilibrium condition. The evolution of the population densities of each individual rovibrational level is explicitly determined via the numerical solution of the master equation for temperatures ranging from 5000 to 50,000 K. The reaction rate coefficients are taken from an ab initio database developed at NASA Ames Research Center. The macroscopic relaxation times, energy transfer rates, and dissociation rate coefficients are extracted from the solution of the master equation. The computed rotational-translational (RT) and vibrational-translational (VT) relaxation times are different at low heat bath temperatures (e.g., RT is about two orders of magnitude faster than VT at T = 5000 K), but they converge to a common limiting value at high temperature. This is contrary to the conventional interpretation of thermal relaxation in which translational and rotational relaxation timescales are assumed comparable with vibrational relaxation being considerable slower. Thus, this assumption is questionable under high temperature non-equilibrium conditions. The exchange reaction plays a very significant role in determining the dynamics of the population densities. The macroscopic energy transfer and dissociation rates are found to be slower when exchange processes are neglected. A macroscopic dissociation rate coefficient based on the quasi-stationary distribution, exhibits excellent agreement with experimental data of Appleton et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 48, 599-608 (1968)]. However, at higher temperatures, only about 50% of dissociation is found to take place under quasi-stationary state conditions. This suggest the necessity of explicitly including some rovibrational levels, when solving a global kinetic rate equation.},

 abstract = {We present a systematic test of four general semiclassical procedures for the theoretical treatment of multistate molecular processes such as electronically nonadiabatic photochemical reactions. The methods are tested by comparing their predictions to accurate quantal results for three two-state model reactions involving conical intersections. The four methods tested are Tully’s fewest-switches version of trajectory surface hopping (1990), the Blais–Truhlar trajectory surface hopping method (1983), the Ehrenfest scheme (1975–1979), and the Meyer–Miller method (1979). We test the ability of the classical path methods to predict both electronic probabilities and product rovibrational distributions. For each of the four basic approaches we test six options for extracting final-state information from the calculated dynamics. We find that, although in most cases there is qualitative agreement between average quantum mechanical and trajectory results, the overall average error is about 50% for Tully’s fewest-switches method, the Ehrenfest method, and the Meyer–Miller method, and even higher, about 60%, for the Blais–Truhlar method. These values do not include additional errors in the below-threshold regions, which are especially large for the Meyer–Miller method because of the electronic zero-point energy in the Meyer–Miller classical analog Hamiltonian.},

Combined with a CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(Q+d)Z dipole moment surface (DMS), an infrared (IR) line list (denoted Ames-296K) has been computed at 296 K and covers up to 8000 cm(-1). Compared to the HITRAN and CDMS databases, the intensity agreement for most vibrational bands is better than 85%-90%. Our predictions for (34)S(16)O2 band origins, higher energy (32)S(16)O2 band origins and missing (32)S(16)O2 IR bands have been verified by most recent experiments and available HITRAN data. We conclude that the Ames-1 PES is able to predict (32/34)S(16)O2 band origins below 5500 cm(-1) with 0.01-0.03 cm(-1) uncertainties, and the Ames-296K line list provides continuous, reliable and accurate IR simulations.

 abstract = {We present a comparative study of several empirical and nonempirical models for the absorption potential, which is the imaginary part of an optical-model potential, for electron scattering by rare gases. We show that the elastic differential cross section is most sensitive to the absorption potential for high-impact energy and large scattering angles. We compare differential cross sections calculated by several models for the absorption potential and by several arbitrary modifications of these model potentials. We are able to associate the effect of the absorption potential on the elastic differential cross section with its form at small electron-atom distances r, and we are able to deduce various qualitative features that the absorption potential must possess at small and large r in order to predict both accurate differential cross sections and accurate absorption cross sections. Based on these observations, the Pauli blocking conditions of the quasifree scattering model for the absorption potential are modified empirically, thus producing a more accurate model that may be applied to other systems; e.g., electron-molecule scattering, with no adjustable parameters.},

 abstract = {A new 626-based Ames-2 PES refinement and Ames-2016 line lists for 13 CO2 isotopologues are reported. A consistent σRMS=±0.02 cm−1 is established for hundreds of isotopologue band origins using the Ames-2 PES. Ames-2016 line lists are computed at 296K, 1000K and 4000K using the Ames-2 PES and the same DMS-N2 dipole surface used previously, with J up to 150, E′ up to 24,000 cm−1 or 18,000 cm−1 and appropriate intensity cutoffs. The lists are compared to the CDSD-296, CDSD-4000 databases, UCL line lists, and a few recent highly accurate CO2 intensity measurements. Both agreements and discrepancies are discussed. Compared to the old Ames CO2 lists, the Ames-2016 line lists have line position deviations reduced by 50% or more, which consequently leads to more reliable intensities. The line shape parameters in the Ames-2016 line lists are predicted using the newly assigned conventional vibrational polyad quantum numbers for rovibrational levels below 12,000 cm−1 so the quality of the line shape parameters is similar to that of CDSD or HITRAN. This study further proves that a semi-empirically refined PES (Ames-1 and Ames-2) coupled with a high quality ab initio DMS (DMS-N2 and UCL) may generate IR predictions with consistent accuracy and is thus helpful in the analysis of laboratory spectra and simulations of various isotopologues. The Ames-2016 lists based on DMS-N2 have reached the ∼1% intensity prediction accuracy level for the recent 626 30013-00001 and 20013-00001 bands, but further quantification and improvements require sub-percent or sub-half-percent accurate experimental intensities. The inter-isotopologue consistency of the intensity prediction accuracies should have reached better than 1–3% for regular bands not affected by resonances. Since the Effective Dipole Models (EDM) in CDSD and HITRAN have 1–20% or even larger uncertainties, we show that the Ames lists can provide better alternative IR data for many hard-to-determine isotopologue bands. Comparison at 4000K suggests that the Ames-4000K 12C16O2 line list is reliable and consistent within the current cutoffs of J ≤ 150 and E′ ≤ 24,000 cm−1, but intensity contributions involving higher energy levels should not be omitted and future computations need to be converged up to at least 32,000 cm−1 or higher. The remaining issues are discussed regarding the source of energy level discrepancies, intensity underestimations by ∼50% for some weak bands, etc. and also future work.},

@article{pub.1100902033,
 abstract = {This work aims to construct a reduced order model for energy transfer and dissociation in non-equilibrium nitrogen mixtures. The objective is twofold: to present the Coarse-Grain Quasi-Classical Trajectory (CG-QCT) method, a novel framework for constructing a reduced order model for diatom-diatom systems; and to analyze the physics of non-equilibrium relaxation of the nitrogen molecules undergoing dissociation in an ideal chemical reactor. The CG-QCT method couples the construction of the reduced order model under the coarse-grain model framework with the quasi-classical trajectory calculations to directly construct the reduced model without the need for computing the individual rovibrational specific kinetic data. In the coarse-grain model, the energy states are lumped together into groups containing states with similar properties, and the distribution of states within each of these groups is prescribed by a Boltzmann distribution at the local translational temperature. The required grouped kinetic properties are obtained directly by the QCT calculations. Two grouping strategies are considered: energy-based grouping, in which states of similar internal energy are lumped together, and vibrational grouping, in which states with the same vibrational quantum number are grouped together. A zero-dimensional chemical reactor simulation, in which the molecules are instantaneously heated, forcing the system into strong non-equilibrium, is used to study the differences between the two grouping strategies. The comparison of the numerical results against available experimental data demonstrates that the energy-based grouping is more suitable to capture dissociation, while the energy transfer process is better described with a vibrational grouping scheme. The dissociation process is found to be strongly dependent on the behavior of the high energy states, which contribute up to 50% of the dissociating molecules. Furthermore, up to 40% of the energy required to dissociate the molecules comes from the rotational mode, underscoring the importance of accounting for this mode when constructing non-equilibrium kinetic models. In contrast, the relaxation process is governed primarily by low energy states, which exhibit significantly slower transitions in the vibrational binning model due to the prevalence of mode separation in these states.},

 abstract = {The quality of Ames-296K SO2 Infrared (IR) line list intensities is first validated by quantitative exploration of several dipole moment surfaces (DMSs) and partition sum convergence. The DMSs are computed with several of Dunning's correlation-consistent basis sets and their vibrational dependence are compared to the empirical model derived from Stark effect experiments reported by D. Patel, D. Margolese, and T.R. Dyke [J. Chem. Phys. 70, 2740 (1979)]. The effective dipole deviations from the DMS adopted in the Ames IR lists is 0.2–0.4% for vibrational states up to 3ν3. The vibrational dependence of the dipole moment is also in good agreement, except for nν1. Partition sum convergence at 296 K is confirmed by new calculations with rotational quantum number J up to 150 and upper state E’ up to 8000 cm−1. The isotopologue consistency of the Ames IR line lists is superior relative to the regular Effective Hamiltonian (EH) models and Effective Dipole Moment (EDM) models. The ν1 + ν2 and ν2 + ν3 intensity consistency check reveals the recently reported experimental intensities need significant improvement or re-analysis. After the accuracy, convergence, and isotopologue consistency have been confirmed, the theoretical Ames-296K intensities are combined with the experimental line positions or EH models that experimental spectroscopists published after 2009. Three high-resolution IR line sets are reported for the 32/33/34S16O2, 32S18O2 and 16O32S18O isotopologues: (1) the “New Lines Sets” include experimentally measured line positions; (2) the “Expanded Line Sets” include possible transitions among new rovibrational levels assigned in experiments and ground state (GS) levels predicted by reliable EH models; (3) the “Ames + MARVEL Sets” include possible transitions among all those levels reported in a recent MARVEL analysis. [Tóbiás et al, JQSRT 208, 152 (2018)]. Compared to the limited data in High-resolution TRANsmission molecular absorption database (HITRAN), these line sets have significantly improved the data coverage up to 4000 cm−1. Some missing bands can be traced to the unpublished experimental data. The isotopologue consistency of these line sets will help identify the uncertainties and defects in the experimental EH and EDM models. These line sets are good candidates for the next HITRAN update, if line shape parameters are available. The line sets can be downloaded from supplementary files or from the Ames Molecular Spectroscopic Database at http://huang.seti.org.},

This paper presents our new BTRHE (Best Theory + Reliable High-resolution Experiment) strategy implementation. For line intensity, the isotopologue consistency and the patterns of mass dependence in the Ames-296 K SO2 and CO2 IR lists are quantitatively presented along the mass-inverse coordinates. The consistency and patterns are better than those in existing experimental data. The methodology proposed here can be used to identify inconsistencies, outliers, and mistakes in intensities, and help improve Effective Dipole Model (EDM) and molecular IR databases. We call for an experimental study on the 50006 and 60007 bands of CO2 628. For line position predictions, a simple approach combining the variational IR line lists with Effective Hamiltonian (EH) model may refine the effective rotational constants A0/B0/C 0 and quartic centrifugal distortion constants of minor isotopologues. The prediction accuracy may be improved by two orders of magnitude, i.e. reaching 0–5 MHz prediction accuracy in the range of J < 20–30, Ka < 10–20, and 0.01–0.02 MHz accuracy for A0/B0/C 0. Several important factors have been systematically investigated and discussed, e.g. convergence, uncertainties, higher order terms, fixing EH parameters, mass coordinates, etc. A microwave (MW) line set consisting of 644,636 strong transitions (at 296K) for all 30 isotopologues and corresponding refined EH(Ames) parameters are reported in the supplementary material. This approach may be easily extended to rovibrational bands, hot bands, and other molecular systems.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we present a method to generate state-resolved reaction cross
sections in analytical form for rovibrational energy excitation and
dissociation of a molecular gas. The method is applied to an ab initio database
for the N2-N system devel- oped at NASA Ames Research Center. The detailed
information on N2 +N collisions contained in this database has been reduced by
adapting a Uniform RoVibrational- Collisional bin model originally developed
for rate coefficients. Using a 10-bin system as an example, a comparison is
made between two sets of coarse-grain cross sections, obtained by analytical
inversion and direct binning respectively. The analytical in- version approach
is especially powerful, because it manages to compress the entire set of
rovibrational-level-specific data from the Ames database into a much smaller
set of numerical parameters, sufficient to reconstruct all coarse-grain cross
sections for any particular N2 +N-collision pair. As a result of this approach,
the computational cost in in large-scale Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)
flow simulations is sig- nificantly reduced, both in terms of memory
requirements and execution time. The intended application is the simulation of
high-temperature gas-dynamics phenomena in shock-heated flows via the DSMC
method. Such conditions are typically encoun- tered in high-altitude,
high-speed atmospheric entry, or in shock-tube experiments. Using this
coarse-grain model together with ab initio rate data will enable more accu-
rate modeling nonequilibrium phenomena, such as vibrationally-favored
dissociation, an effect that is not well-captured by the conventional models
prevalent in DSMC (i.e. Larsen-Borgnakke and Total Collision Energy).},

 abstract = {In order to further improve the accuracy of rovibrational IR line lists generated from the “Best Theory + Reliable High-resolution Experiment” (BTRHE) strategy from 0.01 to 0.05 cm−1, or 300–1500 MHz, to ∼10 MHz, we explore the current limits of the Data-Model-Theory synergy by examining the accuracy and consistency of existing data, then propose that “hot” bands in microwave (MW) spectra is the solution we need for future enhancements. The Ames SO2 J = 0–20 rovibrational energy levels computed on the semi-empirically refined Ames-2 potential energy surface (PES) are fit to the Effective Hamiltonian (EH) model regularly used in the experimental infrared (IR) analysis for SO2 isotopologues. In the fitted EH(Ames) model, the rotational constants A/B/C and all 5 quartic centrifugal distortion constants display clear, systematic, and consistent patterns along the vibrational state energy or quanta. Such consistent patterns may facilitate the vibrational assignments for MW hot bands and extract more information from high temperature MW spectra. Some EH(Expt) analyses were carried out with the lowest order Coriolis Coupling term, C 1. Their constants should not be directly compared with other EH(Expt) and EH(Ames) results. After excluding them, our δ = EH(Ames)- EH(Expt) analyses for 5 isotopologues (626, 636, 646, 628 and 828) indicates some loss of accuracy and consistency starting from vibrational states as low as 2ν 2 or 1000 cm−1. Some EH parameters, e.g. δ K, may have relative deviations as large as 50–100% and totally lose any recognizable patterns. This simply means that current EH(Expt) models do not have the system-wide consistency we need to further refine the EH(Ames) and Ames rovibrational IR line lists. A large part of such defects are probably inherited from the limited precision of experimental line positions, i.e. 1E-3 ∼ 1E-4 cm−1, or 3–30 MHz. This is confirmed in a series of truncation tests using the Ames data. Although the EH(Ames) consistency may help identify unreliable rovibrational EH(Expt) parameters, and make reliable predictions for minor isotopologues and unobserved vibrational bands, we believe only the highly accurate “hot” MW transitions can provide real enhancements for EH(Expt) accuracy and consistency. “Hot” MW spectra should play a more significant role in the future synergy of Data, Model, and Theory in the field of rovibrational IR studies.},

 abstract = {ConspectusWe review the Best Theory + Reliable High-Resolution Experiment (BTRHE) strategy for obtaining highly accurate molecular rovibrational line lists with InfraRed (IR) intensities. The need for highly accurate molecular rovibrational line lists is twofold: (a) assignment of the many rovibrational lines for common stable molecules especially those that exhibit a large amplitude motion, such as NH<sub>3</sub>, or have a high density of states such as SO<sub>2</sub>; and (b) characterization of the atmospheres of exoplanets, which will be one of the main areas of research in astronomy in the coming decades. The first motivation arises due to the need to eliminate lines due to common molecules in an astronomical observation in order to identify lines from new molecules, while the second motivation arises due to the need to obtain accurate molecular opacities in order to characterize the atmosphere of an exoplanet. The BTRHE strategy first consists of using high-quality ab initio quantum-chemical methods to obtain a global potential energy surface (PES) and dipole moment surface (DMS) that contains the proper physics. The global PES is then refined using a subset of the reliable high-resolution experimental data. The refined PES then gives energy-level predictions to an accuracy similar to the reproduction accuracy of the experimental data used in the refinement step in the interpolation region (i.e., within the range of the experimental data used in the refinement step). The accuracy of the energy levels will slowly degrade as they are extrapolated to spectral regions beyond the high-resolution experimental data used in the refinement step. However, because the degradation is slow, the predicted energy levels can be used to assign new high-resolution experiments, and the data from these can then be used in a subsequent refinement step. In this way, the global PES eventually can yield highly accurate energy levels for all desired spectral regions including to very high energies and high <i>J</i> values. We show that IR intensities computed with the BTRHE rovibrational wave functions and the DMS can be very accurate provided one has minimized the fitting error of the DMS and tested the completeness of the DMS. Some examples of our work on NH<sub>3</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> are given to highlight the usefulness of the BTRHE strategy and to provide ideas on how to further improve its predictive power in the future. In particular, it is shown how successive refinement steps, once new high-resolution data are available, can lead to PESs that yield highly accurate transition energies to larger spectral regions. The importance of including nonadiabatic corrections to reduce the <i>J</i>-dependence of errors for H-containing molecules is shown with work on NH<sub>3</sub>. Another very important aspect of the BTRHE approach is the consistency across isotopologues, which allows for highly accurate line lists for any isotopologue once one is obtained for the main isotopologue (which has more high-resolution data available for refinement).},

 abstract = {The HITRAN database is a compilation of molecular spectroscopic parameters. It was established in the early 1970s and is used by various computer codes to predict and simulate the transmission and emission of light in gaseous media (with an emphasis on terrestrial and planetary atmospheres). The HITRAN compilation is composed of five major components: the line-by-line spectroscopic parameters required for high-resolution radiative-transfer codes, experimental infrared absorption cross-sections (for molecules where it is not yet feasible for representation in a line-by-line form), collision-induced absorption data, aerosol indices of refraction, and general tables (including partition sums) that apply globally to the data. This paper describes the contents of the 2020 quadrennial edition of HITRAN. The HITRAN2020 edition takes advantage of recent experimental and theoretical data that were meticulously validated, in particular, against laboratory and atmospheric spectra. The new edition replaces the previous HITRAN edition of 2016 (including its updates during the intervening years). All five components of HITRAN have undergone major updates. In particular, the extent of the updates in the HITRAN2020 edition range from updating a few lines of specific molecules to complete replacements of the lists, and also the introduction of additional isotopologues and new (to HITRAN) molecules: SO, CH 3 F, GeH 4 , CS 2 , CH 3 I and NF 3 . Many new vibrational bands were added, extending the spectral coverage and completeness of the line lists. Also, the accuracy of the parameters for major atmospheric absorbers has been increased substantially, often featuring sub-percent uncertainties. Broadening parameters associated with the ambient pressure of water vapor were introduced to HITRAN for the first time and are now available for several molecules. The HITRAN2020 edition continues to take advantage of the relational structure and efficient interface available at www.hitran.org and the HITRAN Application Programming Interface (HAPI). The functionality of both tools has been extended for the new edition.},

This paper presents the construction of the ground state singlet HCN potential energy surface (PES), $^1A'$ and state-to-state (StS) kinetics of the molecule-atom systems associated with HCN. The ground state HCN surface is associated to the ground state of CN ($^2\Sigma^+$) and NH ($^3\Sigma^-$) and the first excited state of CH ($^4\Sigma^-$). Multi-reference configuration interaction calculations are used to compute the ab-initio points on a grid of geometries for the diatomic potentials and the full PES. A total of 11688 ab-initio points are used to construct the potential energy surface.The diatomic potentials are fit to the Modified Morse functional form and the potential energy surface fit is obtained using a permutationally invariant polynomial neural network (PIP-NN). The RMS error in the potential energy surface fit are is upto 0.2 eV in the 0-25 eV energy range. The PES constructed highlights some important topological features. Firstly, the exchange of CH and NH to CN is barrier-less and second, the potential energy surface is characterized by two deep wells corresponding to HCN and HNC molecules in their ground singlet states. The considerably larger depth of the CN molecule diatomic potential and the barrier-less exchange pathway make exchange reactions and exchange assisted dissociation important kinetic features of the system. The potential energy surface constructed is used to carry out quasi-classical trajectory calculations followed by state-to-state isothermal heat bath simulations to study macroscopic quantities of interest to atmospheric entry. Furthermore, the exchange associated dissociation in CH and NH causes the dissociation to happen an order of magnitude faster in time when compared to only direct dissociation with the contribution due to exchange being $84.7\%$ and $82.5\%$ in the dissociation source terms, respectively.},

Definitive rovibrational quantum numbers were assigned for 1602 transitions pertaining to 809 upper levels and eight vibrational bands: 0111E, 0111A, 1101, 0310, 0211, 1300, 0103 and 0302. When compared to the results from Cacciani et al. [JQSRT 2020, 258:107,334], our results, termed as the “JPL+Ames 2021″ list (or JA list), showed good agreement for the assignment of 1278 transitions. We have further made new assignments for 179 transitions that were not assigned in their work, plus assignments for 87 new lines reported for the first time. Excellent agreement (± 0.002 cm−1) was observed in the line positions between this work and Cacciani et al., with no systematic discrepancies. Remaining discrepancies on the assignments have been attributed to line blendings, unaccounted resonances, the uncertainties of reference line lists, and limited transition-matching accuracy. An empirical line list (JPL) and a semi-empirical line list adopting the UCL-C2018 [Coles et al., JQSRT 2018, 219:199] intensity with the Ames HSL-Pre3 based line positions were employed as the major reference for our analysis. In addition to the line position / intensity measurements and cross-validation through combination difference analysis, part of the work has also required manual matches for valid transition and level pairs and checking the consistency and patterns of δΕ Calc-Obs, inversion splittings Δa-s , etc. Band-by-band discussions are presented on the missing intensity of ν2+3ν4 (0103), the unusual sensitivity of ν1+3ν2 (1300) s levels, the borrowed intensity of 6ν2 (0600), and potential outliers of ν1+ν2+ν4 (1101), etc. These will be the topics in our future work.},

The <i>S</i><sub>UCL2015</sub> (or <i>S</i><sub>HITRAN2016</sub>) have larger deviations (vs <i>S</i><sub>DLR</sub>) and uncertainties (vs <i>S</i><sub>DLR</sub>, <i>S</i><sub>NIST</sub>) which are attributed to the less accurate Ames-1 PES adopted in UCL-296 line list calculation. The <i>S</i><sub>Ames-2021</sub> intensity of <sup>12</sup>C<sup>16</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and <sup>13</sup>C<sup>16</sup>O<sub>2</sub> is utilized to derive new absolute <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratios for Vienna PeeDee Belemnite (VPDB) with uncertainty reduced by <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> or <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub>. Further evaluation of <i>S</i><sub>Ames-2021</sub> intensities are carried out on those CO<sub>2</sub> bands discussed in the HITRAN2020 update paper. Consistent improvements and better accuracies are found in band-by-band analysis, except for those bands strongly affected by Coriolis couplings, or very weak bands measured with relatively larger experimental uncertainties. The Ames-2021 296 K IR line lists are generated for 13 CO<sub>2</sub> isotopologues, with 18 000 cm<sup>-1</sup> and <i>S</i><sub>296 K</sub> &gt; 1 × 10<sup>-31</sup> cm/molecule cutoff and then combined with CDSD line positions (except <sup>14</sup>C<sup>16</sup>O<sub>2</sub>). The Ames-2021 DMS and 296 K IR line lists represent a major improvement over previous CO<sub>2</sub> theoretical IR intensity studies, including Ames-2016, UCL-296, and recent UCL DMS 2021 update. A real 1 permille level of agreement and uncertainty will definitely require <i>both</i> more accurate PES <i>and</i> more accurate DMS.},

 abstract = {Understanding the kinetics of the HCN system is critical to several disciplines in science and engineering, including interstellar chemistry, atmospheric reentry, and combustion, to name a few. This paper constructs a rovibrational state-specific kinetic mechanism for the HCN system, leveraging electronic structure calculations, classical scattering dynamics, and state-to-state kinetics. To this aim, three accurate potential energy surfaces (PESs), <sup>1</sup><i>A</i>', <sup>3</sup><i>A</i>', and <sup>3</sup><i>A</i>″, are constructed using multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) calculations for a comprehensive arrangement of the nuclei. Quasi-classical scattering calculations provide elementary reaction rate constants resulting from the interaction between the CN, CH, and NH molecules with H, N, and C atoms, respectively. The rovibrational collisional model developed comprises 50 million bound-bound and free-bound collisional processes. This model is used to study the dynamics of energy transfer and dissociation in an isochoric and isothermal chemical reactor <i>via</i> the solution of the master equation for a wide temperature range from 1000 to 10,000 K. This study unravels the dynamics of dissociation of the molecules in the HCN system, which the PESs primarily control <i>via</i> the formation of short-lived intermediates that shortcut the dissociation pathway. The exchange processes in CH and NH enhance the dissociation by over 80%. The importance of exchange processes is also highlighted in comparing the quasi-steady state and thermal dissociation rates with state-of-the-art rate models and experimental fits.},

@article{pub.1155061851,
 abstract = {AI-3000K is a semi-empirical IR line list constructed for hot CO2 spectra analysis and simulation up to 3000 – 4000 K. Compared to previously published Ames-1000K and UCL-4000, it represents a major upgrade, utilizing a new algorithm for optimization and including the latest improvements in potential energy surface (PES), dipole moment surface (DMS), and room temperature IR line list (Ames-2021 296K). To maximize the success of introducing experimental based accurate line positions, a new PES (X01d) was refined with respect to >800 selected CDSD2019 [Tashkun et al. JQSRT (2019) 228, 124] energy levels in the range of 0 – 24,000 cm−1, with σrms = 0.5 – 0.7 cm−1. Most differences between the X01d PES based levels and CDSD2019 energies are within ± 2 cm−1. A new DMS is fitted from extrapolated CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(T,Q,5)Z dipole calculations, with σrms = 5.1 × 10−6 au for 11,155 geometries up to 40,000 cm−1, denoted Ames-2021–40K. Compared to the best available Ames-2021 DMS and room temperature IR line list [Huang et al J. Phys. Chem. A (2022) 126, 5940], the relative intensity differences are expected to be ∼ 1 ‰. The line position accuracy of ''X01d + Ames-2021–40K'' IR line list is significantly improved by adopting CDSD2019 energy levels up to 24,000 cm−1 (J ≤ 150). The Einstein A 21 coefficients for E' < 15,000 cm−1 transitions are replaced by more accurate values from the Ames-2021 296K IR line list. In short, the AI-3000K is the X01d PES and Ames-2021–40K DMS based line list enhanced with the A 21 of Ames-2021 296K line list and CDSD energy levels. It provides continuous coverage from 0 to 20,000 cm−1 for the four most abundant isotopologues: 12C16O2 (626), 13C16O2 (636), 16O12C18O (628), and 16O12C17O (627). The impacts of isotopologue and E'/E'' cutoffs have been examined. Intensity convergence (not accuracy) of AI-3000K line list is quantitatively estimated in 1 cm−1 bins. It is better than 99% in the whole range of 0 – 20,000 (or 10,000) cm−1 at 1000 K (or 2000 K), or better than 90% in the whole range of 0 – 15,000 (or 9000) cm−1 at 2000 K (or 3000 K), respectively. Convergence beyond 3000 K will require a new PES and DMS for E' > 40,000 cm−1. The AI-3000K and HITEMP based IR simulations are compared to high resolution shock tube experiments for CO2-Ar mixture up to 2000 K. With line position accuracy comparable to that of HITEMP, AI-3000K IR line list yields better agreements at more frequencies. Potential sources of discrepancies with experiment are discussed.},

 abstract = {To facilitate the data analysis of current and future high-resolution space telescope missions, we adopt ‘Best Theory + Reliable High-resolution Experiment’ (BTRHE) strategy to develop highly accurate infrared line lists for nitrous oxide (N2O). The ‘Ames-1’ potential energy surface (PES) is a CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ PES refined using selected HITRAN experimental data, with σrms = 0.02–0.03 cm-1 for five isotopologues. The ‘Ames-1’ dipole moment surface (DMS) is fitted from CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(T,Q,5)Z dipoles extrapolated to one electron basis set limit. Using the Ames-1 PES and DMS, Ames-296K line lists are computed in the full range of 0–15,000 cm-1 for 12 N2O isotopologues, with S296K ≥ 10−31 cm-1/molecule.cm-2. The reliability and consistency of Ames-296K intensity predictions (SAmes) are demonstrated through comparisons with HITRAN (SHITRAN), NOSL-296 (SNOSL), recent observed intensities (Sobs) and Effective Dipole Model (EDM) intensities (SEDM). Agreements and discrepancies are discussed, along with preliminary uncertainty estimate for SAmes. The SAmes provides a good constraint to prevent substantial errors in intensity predictions (e.g. for weak bands and minor isotopologues) and can be further improved. Ames-296K and NOSL-296 may complement each other to provide improved input for future database updates, combining the strengths of EH/EDM and BTRHE approaches.

@article{pub.1171503263,
 abstract = {To facilitate atmospheric and spectroscopic studies of carbon disulfide, or CS2, in both planetary and exoplanetary atmospheres, we adopt the “Best Theory + Reliable High-resolution Experiment” algorithm to generate semiempirical IR line lists for the 20 most abundant CS2 isotopologues, denoted as Ames-296K. The IR lists are computed using the Ames-1 potential energy surface, refined using the experimental transition set and an ab initio dipole moment surface fitted from CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV(T/Q/5+d)Z dipoles extrapolated to a one-particle basis set limit. The IR lists cover the range of 0–10,000 cm−1, with an S 296K cutoff at 10−31 cm−1/molecule·cm−2 (abundance included). A “natural” IR line list at 296 K includes about 10 million lines of the 20 isotopologues, with their intensities scaled by the corresponding abundances. The zero-point energy, partition functions, and abundances are reported for each isotopologue. The energy levels in the global effective Hamiltonian model for 12C32S2 are adopted to improve the line position accuracy. This new IR list for the main isotopologue is denoted as A+I.296K. Reliable HITRAN2020 line positions are also utilized to improve the accuracy of the 32S12C34S, 32S12C33S, and 32S13C32S isotopologue line lists. The final composite line list is validated against Pacific Northwest National Laboratory experimental cross sections, showing excellent agreement. The agreement supports the quality of the composite line list and the power of synergy between experiment and theory. The new data are proposed for use in updating and expanding the CS2 data in HITRAN and other high-resolution IR databases. Supplementary files are available in Zenodo and AHED.},
