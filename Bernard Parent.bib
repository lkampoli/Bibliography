 abstract = {A new set of ion and electron transport equations is proposed to simulate steady or unsteady quasi-neutral or non-neutral multicomponent weakly-ionized plasmas through the drift–diffusion approximation. The proposed set of equations is advantaged over the conventional one by being considerably less stiff in quasi-neutral regions because it can be integrated in conjunction with a potential equation based on Ohmʼs law rather than Gaussʼs law. The present approach is advantaged over previous attempts at recasting the system by being applicable to plasmas with several types of positive ions and negative ions and by not requiring changes to the boundary conditions. Several test cases of plasmas enclosed by dielectrics and of glow discharges between electrodes show that the proposed equations yield the same solution as the standard equations but require 10 to 100 times fewer iterations to reach convergence whenever a quasi-neutral region forms. Further, several grid convergence studies indicate that the present approach exhibits a higher resolution (and hence requires fewer nodes to reach a given level of accuracy) when ambipolar diffusion is present. Because the proposed equations are not intrinsically linked to specific discretization or integration schemes and exhibit substantial advantages with no apparent disadvantage, they are generally recommended as a substitute to the fluid models in which the electric field is obtained from Gaussʼs law as long as the plasma remains weakly-ionized and unmagnetized.},

 abstract = {Despite its success at simulating accurately both non-neutral and quasi-neutral weakly-ionized plasmas, the drift-diffusion model has been observed to be a particularly stiff set of equations. Recently, it was demonstrated that the stiffness of the system could be relieved by rewriting the equations such that the potential is obtained from Ohm's law rather than Gauss's law while adding some source terms to the ion transport equation to ensure that Gauss's law is satisfied in non-neutral regions. Although the latter was applicable to multicomponent and multidimensional plasmas, it could not be used for plasmas in which the magnetic field was significant. This paper hence proposes a new computationally-efficient set of electron and ion transport equations that can be used not only for a plasma with multiple types of positive and negative ions, but also for a plasma in magnetic field. Because the proposed set of equations is obtained from the same physical model as the conventional drift-diffusion equations without introducing new assumptions or simplifications, it results in the same exact solution when the grid is refined sufficiently while being more computationally efficient: not only is the proposed approach considerably less stiff and hence requires fewer iterations to reach convergence but it yields a converged solution that exhibits a significantly higher resolution. The combined faster convergence and higher resolution is shown to result in a hundredfold increase in computational efficiency for some typical steady and unsteady plasma problems including non-neutral cathode and anode sheaths as well as quasi-neutral regions.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes an alternate form of the active-domain method [K. Nakahashi and E. Saitoh, AIAA J.35, 1280 (1997)] that is applicable to streamwise separated flows. Named the “marching window,” the algorithm consists of performing pseudo-time iterations on a minimal width subdomain composed of a sequence of cross-stream planes of nodes. The upstream boundary of the subdomain is positioned such that all nodes upstream exhibit a residual smaller than the user-specified convergence threshold. The advancement of the downstream boundary follows the advancement of the upstream boundary, except in zones of significant streamwise ellipticity, where a streamwise ellipticity sensor ensures its continuous progress. Compared to the standard pseudo-time-marching approach, the marching window decreases the work required for convergence by up to 24 times for flows with little streamwise ellipticity and by up to eight times for flows with large streamwise separated regions. Storage is reduced by up to six times by not allocating memory to the nodes not included in the computational subdomain. The marching window satisfies the same convergence criterion as the standard pseudo-time-stepping methods, hence resulting in the same converged solution within the tolerance of the user-specified convergence threshold. The algorithm is not restricted to a discretization stencil and pseudo-time-stepping scheme in particular and is used here with the Yee–Roe scheme and block-implicit approximate factorization solving the Favre-averaged Navier–Stokes (FANS) equations closed by the Wilcox kω turbulence model. The eigenstructure of the FANS equations is also presented.},

 abstract = {A novel alteration to the Cauchy–Kowalevski procedure is here presented to obtain essentially monotonic solutions for multidimensional flows. It is argued that this can be accomplished by splitting the cross-derivative terms among the several dimensions, such that the coefficient of the cross derivatives remains small compared to the coefficient of the normal derivatives. The approach naturally lends itself to extending the Roe flux difference splitting scheme to multiple dimensions and is advantaged over previous Cauchy–Kowalevski-based methods by yielding a solution free of spurious oscillations in the vicinity of oblique shock waves. Several test cases ranging from low-speed subsonic flows in channels to hypersonic flows over ramp injectors indicate that the proposed genuinely multidimensional method generally achieves a twofold or more increase in resolution along each dimension over the dimensionally split Roe scheme while retaining its appealing attributes: the scheme has a compact three-node-bandwidth stencil, is a finite volume flux function, yields essentially monotonic solutions, introduces minimal dissipation within viscous layers, and is written in general matrix form. Although the method proposed is first-order accurate, it offers a resolution as high or higher than the dimensionally split second-order total-variation-diminishing schemes for many problems of interest and is expected to surpass significantly the latter when extended to second-order accuracy.},

 abstract = {To date, fluid models of plasma sheaths have consisted of the coupling of the electric field potential equation obtained through Gauss’s law to the charged species conservation equations obtained through the drift–diffusion approximation. When discretized using finite-difference stencils, such a set of equations has been observed to be particularly stiff and to often require more than hundreds of thousands of iterations to reach convergence. A new approach at solving sheaths using a fluid model is here presented that reduces significantly the number of iterations to reach convergence while not sacrificing on the accuracy of the converged solution. The method proposed herein consists of rewriting the sheath governing equations such that the electric field is obtained from Ohm’s law rather than from Gauss’s law. To ensure that Gauss’s law is satisfied, some source terms are added to the ion conservation equation. Several time-accurate and steady-state cases of dielectric sheaths, anode sheaths, and cathode sheaths (including glow and dark discharges) are considered. The proposed method is seen to yield the same converged solution as the conventional approach while exhibiting a reduction in computational effort varying between one-hundred-fold and ten-thousand-fold whenever the plasma includes both quasi-neutral regions and non-neutral sheaths.},

 abstract = {As demonstrated by Parent, B., et al., (“Electron and Ion Transport Equations in Computational Weakly-Ionized Plasmadynamics,” Journal of Computational Physics, Vol. 259, 2014, pp. 51–69), the computational efficiency of the drift-diffusion plasma model can be increased significantly by recasting the equations such that the potential is obtained from Ohm’s law rather than Gauss’s law and by adding source terms to the ion transport equations to ensure that Gauss’s law is satisfied. Not only did doing so reduce the stiffness of the system, leading to faster convergence, but it also resulted in a higher resolution of the converged solution. The combined gains in convergence acceleration and resolution amounted to a hundredfold increase in computational efficiency when simulating nonneutral plasmas with significant quasi-neutral regions. In this paper, it is shown that such a recast of the drift-diffusion model has yet another advantage: its lack of stiffness permits the electron and ion transport equations to be integrated in coupled form along with the Favre-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. Test cases relevant to plasma aerodynamics (including nonneutral sheaths, magnetic field effects, and negative ions) demonstrate that the proposed coupled system of equations can be converged in essentially the same number of iterations as that describing nonionized flows while not sacrificing the generality of the drift-diffusion model.},

 abstract = {Modeling of ambipolar diffusion and drift taking place within a weakly-ionized fluid can lead to some convergence difficulties when the ion conservation equation and the electric field potential equation are solved consecutively. A novel formulation of the ion flow rate is proposed here that reduces the computing effort to reach convergence by a factor of 10 or more. It is shown that by recasting the ion flow rate in terms of drift and ambipolar diffusion components, the sensitivity to the electric field is reduced hence alleviating the stiffness of the system of equations and permitting significantly faster convergence. What makes the method particularly appealing is that (i) it yields faster convergence without affecting the accuracy of the converged solution and (ii) it is not restricted to specific discretization or relaxation schemes and can hence be readily implemented in existing flow solvers. Because it is developed in general form (i.e. applicable to a multicomponent plasma in the simultaneous presence of electric current and magnetic and electric fields), the method is notably well-suited to simulate ambipolar diffusion within ionized multi-species flow solvers and is recommended for all flowfields as long as the plasma remains weakly-ionized and quasi-neutral.},

 abstract = {A new class of flux-limited schemes for systems of conservation laws is presented that is both high-resolution and positivity-preserving. The schemes are obtained by extending the Steger–Warming method to second-order accuracy through the use of component-wise TVD flux limiters while ensuring that the coefficients of the discretization equation are positive. A coefficient is considered positive if it has all-positive eigenvalues and has the same eigenvectors as those of the convective flux Jacobian evaluated at the corresponding node. For certain systems of conservation laws, such as the Euler equations for instance, this condition is sufficient to guarantee positivity-preservation. The method proposed is advantaged over previous positivity-preserving flux-limited schemes by being capable to capture with high resolution all wave types (including contact discontinuities, shocks, and expansion fans). Several test cases are considered in which the Euler equations in generalized curvilinear coordinates are solved in 1D, 2D, and 3D. The test cases confirm that the proposed schemes are positivity-preserving while not being significantly more dissipative than the conventional TVD methods. The schemes are written in general matrix form and can be used to solve other systems of conservation laws, as long as they are homogeneous of degree one.},

The latter takes into consideration the current due to the non-neutrality of the plasma, the current due to the Hall effect, and the currents due to the ion slip associated with each type of ion. An equation for the electric field potential applicable to a non-neutral multicomponent plasma in the presence of a magnetic field is then presented. Despite some similarities between the potential equation and the Poisson equation, it is argued that the discretization of the potential equation cannot be accomplished in the same manner by using only central differences. It is here proven (and subsequently verified through a test case) that when the plasma exhibits conjunctly a high Hall parameter and a high electrical conductivity gradient, the centered stencils introduce spurious oscillations which can lead to severe numerical error. A novel discretization of the potential equation consisting of a blend of central and upwind differences is then presented. The proposed scheme is consistently monotonic for any value of the Hall parameter and is second-order accurate except in the vicinity of discontinuities.},

The proposed algorithm is then compared to MUSCL for several test cases. Results obtained indicate that while the proposed scheme is more dissipative in the vicinity of contact discontinuities, it performs significantly better than MUSCL when solving strong shocks in hypersonic flowfields: the amount of pressure overshoot downstream of the shock is minimized and the time step can be set to a value typically two or three times higher.

Positivity-preservation is attained by modifying the Roe scheme such that the coefficients of the discretization equation become positive, with a coefficient considered positive if all its eigenvalues are positive and if its eigenvectors correspond to those of the flux Jacobian. Because the modification does not alter the wave speeds at the interface, the appealing attributes of the Roe flux difference splitting schemes are retained, such as high-resolution capture of discontinuous waves, low amount of artificial dissipation within viscous layers, and ease of convergence to steady-state. The proposed flux function is advantaged over previous positivity-preserving variants of the Roe method by being written in general matrix form and hence by being readily deployable to arbitrary systems of conservation laws. The stencils are extended to second-order accuracy through a newly-derived positivity-preserving total-variation-diminishing limiting process that is applied to the characteristic variables and that yields positive coefficients.

 abstract = {A new approach at discretizing the temporal derivative of the Euler equations is here presented which can be used with dual time stepping. The temporal discretization stencil is derived along the lines of the Cauchy–Kowalevski procedure resulting in cross differences in spacetime but with some novel modifications which ensure the positivity of the discretization coefficients. It is then shown that the so-obtained spacetime cross differences result in changes to the wave speeds and can thus be incorporated within Roe or Steger–Warming schemes (with and without reconstruction–evolution) simply by altering the eigenvalues. The proposed approach is advantaged over alternatives in that it is positivity-preserving for the Euler equations. Further, it yields monotone solutions near discontinuities while exhibiting a truncation error in smooth regions less than the one of the second- or third-order accurate backward-difference-formula (BDF) for either small or large time steps. The high resolution and positivity preservation of the proposed discretization stencils are independent of the convergence acceleration technique which can be set to multigrid, preconditioning, Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov, block-implicit, etc. Thus, the current paper also offers the first implicit integration of the time-accurate Euler equations that is positivity-preserving in the strict sense (that is, the density and temperature are guaranteed to remain positive). This is in contrast to all previous positivity-preserving implicit methods which only guaranteed the positivity of the density, not of the temperature or pressure. Several stringent reacting and inert test cases confirm the positivity-preserving property of the proposed method as well as its higher resolution and higher computational efficiency over other second-order and third-order implicit temporal discretization strategies.},

 abstract = {At the high temperatures typical for hypersonic shock and boundary layers, thermal plasma sheaths form naturally near the surfaces. Thermal plasma sheath effects on hypersonic boundary layers have not yet been studied either experimentally or numerically. We here perform the first detailed study of the plasma sheaths taking place within hypersonic boundary layers throughout the flight Mach number range 10-24. The study is performed using a in-house-developed code based on a novel method recently developed which reduces the computational effort needed to solve fully coupled plasma/fluid flows by a factor of 1000. Preliminary results indicate that the thermal plasma sheaths coexist with hypersonic boundary layers for a Mach number higher than 12, have a height commensurate with the boundary layer thickness, and reduce the temperature to the surface by as much as 1000 K. Further, the ratio between the body force exerted by the sheath and the boundary layer momentum is similar to the one observed previously in low-temperature DBD plasma actuator flow control. Such preliminary results indicate that the plasma sheath that forms naturally in hypersonic flows has the potential to affect significantly boundary layer transition as well as heat flux to the surfaces.},

The results are obtained through numerical simulation using two CFD codes, LeMANS and CFDWARP, which include finite-rate chemistry, non-equilibrium of the vibrational and electron energies, and real gas effects. Results obtained indicate that seeding the air flow with as little as 0.001% of cesium leads to plasma densities high enough to interfere with radio communication and to enable electron transpiration cooling (ETC) at flight Mach numbers as little as 9. When no cesium is added, it is seen that significant interference of the plasma on radio communication can occur in the Mach number range 12–18, with the interference becoming more likely for higher flight dynamic pressure.},

 abstract = {Using recently developed advanced numerical methods for plasma flows and sheaths, the first detailed study of electron cooling and heating taking place within hypersonic non-neutral flows is presented here. The numerical simulations fully couple the Navier–Stokes equations for the neutrals to the drift–diffusion model for the electrons and ions and include a 11-species finite-rate chemical solver along with a transport equation for the electron temperature in non-equilibrium. Results for Mach 18 airflow around a wedge with a sharp leading edge show that at low flight dynamic pressure the electron temperature remains close to the freestream temperature in the stagnation region. Such is attributed to the product of the electric field and the electron current being dominantly negative within the plasma sheaths and acting as an electron energy sink. This cooling effect leads to a significant portion of the flow downstream of the shock exhibiting electron temperatures much lower than expected. This study is the first to show a large impact of the non-neutral plasma sheaths on the post-shock electron temperature. This study also shows that the common approach to set the electron temperature equal to the vibrational temperature can result in the electron temperature being over-predicted by one order of magnitude or more in hypersonic flows.},

The accurate modeling of both collisional and collisionless plasma sheaths for hypersonic applications is here presented. This is followed by the outline of recent numerical methods that enable the sheaths to be integrated with large time steps and to be incorporated within CFD codes. For the first time, the electron energy transport in non-equilibrium is here integrated in coupled form with the plasma sheath within a MHD process. Some example test problems are then presented including MHD in a scramjet combustor and electron transpiration cooling in a hypersonic flow. Such show that the plasma sheath effects can be added within CFD simulations with little loss in computational efficiency. The inclusion of plasma sheath models is seen to be critical in predicting accurately such problems.},
