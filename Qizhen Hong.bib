 abstract = {A stagnation streamline model incorporating quantum-state-resolved chemistry is proposed to study hypersonic nonequilibrium flows along the stagnation streamline. This model is developed by reducing the full Navier–Stokes equations to the stagnation streamline with proper approximations for equation closure. The thermochemical nonequilibrium is described by either the state-to-state approach for detailed analysis or conventional two-temperature models for comparison purpose. The model is validated against various data, and nearly identical results are obtained as compared with those from full field computational fluid dynamics data. In addition, the calculated distributions agree well with the measurement data of a shock tube experiment for the dissociation and vibrational relaxation of O2, including the distributions of species mole fractions and vibrational temperature of the first excited state of O2 molecules. Furthermore, the results with the state-resolved chemistry show that the flow within a shock layer exhibits a strong thermochemical nonequilibrium behavior, which is beyond the capability of commonly used two-temperature models to correctly evaluate the dissociation rate and the associated reaction energy. The present model is also employed to calculate the nonequilibrium re-entry flow along the stagnation streamline for a five-species air mixture as an example to demonstrate the model capability. It is found that both species and internal energy are in a nonequilibrium state, especially the vibrational distributions are strongly deviated from the Boltzmann distribution right behind the bow shock and near the wall surface. The results demonstrate that the proposed stagnation streamline model is very useful to understand thermochemical nonequilibrium phenomena in hypersonic flows.},

Phys., 2008, 10, 4281], has been presented to improve its description of, particularly, the short range behavior for specific configurations, with the aim of producing a large database of vibration to vibration (V-V) and vibration to translation/rotation (V-T/R) energy transfer rate coefficients, with an increased accuracy extended to large temperature ranges relevant to the modeling of hypersonic gas flows. The modifications were introduced in a physically meaningful fashion and they are shown to improve the performance of the PES in a wide temperature range, not only for calculating rate coefficients, but also for determining a variety of physical properties. This new PES was then used to calculate V-V and V-T/R rate coefficients for inelastic N<sub>2</sub>-N<sub>2</sub> collisions through a mixed quantum-classical method, based on the quantum treatment of molecular vibrations, for vibrationally excited states up to v = 40. Such a large V-T/R coefficient database is quite unprecedented, and the comparison of the efficiency of the related processes with the corresponding V-V coefficients shows that vibrational relaxation plays a very relevant role in high temperature regimes.},

The potential is formulated analytically according to the nature of the principal interaction components, with the main van der Waals contribution described through the improved Lennard-Jones model. All the parameters involved in the formulation, having a physical meaning, have been modulated in restricted variation ranges, exploiting a combined analysis of experimental and ab initio reference data. The new PES is shown to be able to reproduce a wealth of different physical properties, ranging from the second virial coefficients to transport properties (shear viscosity and thermal conductivity) and rate coefficients for inelastic scattering collisions. Rate coefficients for the vibrational inelastic processes of O<sub>2</sub>, including both vibration-to-vibration (V-V) and vibration-to-translation/rotation (V-T/R) energy exchanges, were then calculated on this PES using a mixed quantum-classical method.

 abstract = {Compound aircraft, merging the advantages of two or more aircraft, is now a promising concept for designing modern aircraft. How to achieve successful docking of two aircraft in flight is an important issue for the applications of vertical compound aircraft. In order to resolve such an issue, this paper proposes a new visual based navigation docking scheme, which is different from rendezvous and docking operations in space applications. The present scheme uses a monocular camera mounted on the chaser aircraft with a certain installation angle to collect the visual features of the target aircraft, then the position and attitude of the landing gear of the target aircraft can be determined. Moreover, a six degrees of freedom docking mechanism mounted on the chaser aircraft is designed to catch hold of the landing gear tires of the target aircraft. In order to avoid undesired collision during the docking process, Z-direction position of the target landing gear is predicted and the proposed Z-direction speed control algorithm is applied to the chaser platform. The robustness of the present scheme has been validated numerically and experimentally by means of a chaser platform and a target platform on the ground testbed. Successful docking of the chaser platform and the target landing gear has been achieved, respectively, when the target platform performs a Z-direction movement and a compound movement.},

This paper proposes a compound flight scheme to achieve vertical take-off for the fixed-wing aircraft, using the carrier aircraft with vertical take-off capability to carry the target aircraft. Compared with the vertical take-off performance of a single aircraft, the present scheme enables the target aircraft to have a larger carrying capacity and longer flight distance. In order to verify the feasibility of the current scheme, this paper first investigates the steady aerodynamic performance of the compound aircraft and the dynamical separation process by computational fluid dynamics simulation. The steady lift coefficient of the compound aircraft during the acceleration stage and the unsteady aerodynamic force during the separation stage are obtained and analyzed. Next, an unmanned aerial vehicle (with vertical take-off and horizontal acceleration capabilities) is designed specifically, and the flight experiments of the vertical take-off and separation processes are conducted. Successful separations are achieved many times in the flight tests, which validate the feasibility of the present scheme.},

 abstract = {A hypersonic laminar flow over double wedges with a fixed forward angle of 15° and varied aft angles is studied using computational fluid dynamics and global stability analysis (GSA) at a free-stream Mach number of 12.82 and a total enthalpy of 21.77 MJ/kg. The specific total enthalpy is high enough to trigger evident vibrational excitation and air chemistry. To assess the effects of thermal and chemical nonequilibrium, three different thermochemistry models of air are considered, including frozen, thermal nonequilibrium, and thermochemical nonequilibrium gases. Two-dimensional base-flow simulations indicate that the onset of incipient and secondary separation is insensitive to the inclusion of thermochemistry, although the size of the separation region is substantially reduced. GSA is then performed on the base flows and identifies a three-dimensional stationary global instability beyond a critical aft angle, which is also insensitive to thermochemical nonequilibrium. The criterion of the global stability boundary established for the supersonic flow over compression corners in a calorically perfect gas in terms of a scaled deflection angle [Hao et al., “Occurrence of global instability in hypersonic compression corner flow,” J. Fluid Mech. 919, A4 (2021)] is, thus, extended to high-enthalpy conditions.},

 abstract = {In a recent communication [2021 Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 23 15475–79] we showed that the correct modelling of vibrational quenching events in O + N2(v) collisions, a fundamental process in air plasmas, requires the detailed representation of intermediate and asymptotic regions of the interaction and the inclusion of several types of processes as vibration to translation (V–T) and vibro-electronic (V–E) energy transfer. For the first time from the publication of experimental results in the 70’s, we obtained theoretical results in agreement with experiments, even at room temperature. In the present work we extend the approach to better describe non-adiabatic V–E deactivation and include the evaluation of the role of the higher excited singlet N2O surface, characterized by new high quality ab initio calculations, to that of the triplet Π and Σ ones. Within this framework, we calculate V–T, V–E and the corresponding total vibrational relaxation rate coefficients for initial vibrational N2(v) quantum numbers up to v = 10 in a wide temperature range (200–10 000 K). These data are of uttermost importance for the modelling of air plasmas, of earth’s and planetary atmospheres and for the design and construction of aircrafts and air-breathing propulsion systems for very low earth orbit (VLEO) satellites.},

In this work, we refit the PES of the N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> system by two methods based on the same data set that was used by Varga et al. The first uses the permutation invariant polynomial-neural network (PIP-NN) method to fit the entire energy of the 55,000 data points. In the second approach, the PIP-NN method is used to fit only the four-body interaction component, a similar treatment in the MB-PIP method, and the resulting PES is named MB-PIP-NN. Then, the performances of these new PESs and the MB-PIP PES are comprehensively and systematically compared, such as comparisons of various scans, properties of stationary points, and dynamics simulations. Possible improvements for the PES of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are suggested. A more reliable PES of the system can be constructed in terms of data sampling range, electronic structure calculation level, and fitting method for high-temperature calculation and simulation in the future.},

 abstract = {The hypersonic flow is in a thermochemical nonequilibrium state due to the high-temperature caused by the strong shock compression. In a thermochemical nonequilibrium flow, the distribution of molecular internal energy levels strongly deviates from the equilibrium distribution (i.e., the Boltzmann distribution). It is intractable to directly obtain the microscopic nonequilibrium distribution from existed experimental measurements usually described by macroscopic field variables such as temperature or velocity. Motivated by the idea of deep multi-scale multi-physics neural network (DeepMMNet) proposed in [1], we develop in this paper a data assimilation framework called DeepStSNet to accurately reconstruct the quantum state-resolved thermochemical nonequilibrium flowfield by using sparse experimental measurements of vibrational temperature and pre-trained deep neural operator networks (DeepONets). In particular, we first construct several DeepONets to express the coupled dynamics between field variables in the thermochemical nonequilibrium flow and to approximate the state-to-state (StS) approach, which traces the variation of each vibrational level of molecule accurately. These proposed DeepONets are then trained by using the numerical simulation data, and would later be served as building blocks for the DeepStSNet. We demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of DeepONets with different test cases showing that the density and energy of vibrational groups as well as the temperature and velocity fields are predicted with high accuracy. We then extend the architectures of DeepMMNet by considering a simplified thermochemical nonequilibrium model, i.e., the 2T model, showing that the entire thermochemical nonequilibrium flowfield is well predicted by using scattered measurements of full or even partial field variables. We next consider a more accurate and complex thermochemical nonequilibrium model, i.e., the StS-CGM model, and develop a DeepStSNet for this model. In this case, we employ the coarse-grained method, which divides the vibrational levels into groups (vibrational bins), to alleviate the computational cost for the StS approach in order to achieve a fast but reliable prediction with DeepStSNet. We test the present DeepStSNet framework with sparse numerical simulation data showing that the predictions are in excellent agreement with the reference data for test cases. We further employ the DeepStSNet to assimilate a few experimental measurements of vibrational temperature obtained from the shock tube experiment, and the detailed non-Boltzmann vibrational distribution of molecule oxygen is reconstructed by using the sparse experimental data for the first time. Moreover, by considering the inevitable uncertainty in the experimental data, an average strategy in the predicting procedure is proposed to obtain the most probable predicted fields. The present DeepStSNet is general and robust, and can be applied to build a bridge from sparse measurements of macroscopic field variables to a microscopic quantum state-resolved flowfield. This kind of reconstruction is beneficial for exploiting the experimental measurements and uncovering the hidden physicochemical processes in hypersonic flows.},

 abstract = {A hybrid stochastic simulation method is developed to study H2-O2 auto-ignition at the microscale. Simulation results show that the discrete and stochastic characteristics of reaction collisions have notable impacts on the ignition process, particularly in the early stages when only a few radicals exist. The statistical properties of ignition delay time, which reflect the accumulated stochasticity during ignition, are obtained and analyzed for different initial temperatures and total molecular numbers. It is found that the average and standard deviation of ignition delay time increase as the total molecular number decreases, with this phenomenon being particularly pronounced near the crossover temperature. When the total molecular number is sufficiently small, the chain initiation reaction becomes crucial to the stochastic properties, as its average firing time exhibits an inverse proportionality to the total molecular number. As the total molecular number increases, the influence of other chain reactions intensifies, causing the power law relation between standard deviation and total molecular number to shift from -1 power to -0.5 power. Owing to different chain reaction paths for high- and low-temperature auto-ignition, the strongest relative fluctuation occurs near the crossover temperature. A theoretical equation for the standard deviation of ignition delay time is obtained based on dimensional analysis, giving excellent agreement with the simulation results in both high- and low-temperature modes.},

 abstract = {The state-of-the-art high-fidelity state-to-state (StS) model is performed to investigate the hypersonic shock wave/laminar boundary layer interaction over a 25°–55° double cone. This work aims to clarify whether the shortcomings of thermochemical models are the underlying source for the discrepancies between the simulations and experiments. A high-enthalpy nitrogen flow with a Mach number of 11.54 and a unit Reynolds number of 4.394×105/m is considered. We first find that the StS and widely used two-temperature models yield two different shock reflection patterns (i.e., the regular reflection and Mach reflection, respectively). However, the surface pressure and heat flux distributions predicted by the two models are generally consistent, which are not influenced by the differences in the shock patterns, dissociation rates, and non-Boltzmann vibrational distributions in the flowfields. Moreover, the StS model fails to match the experiments in spite of fairly limited improvement. Our findings indicate that the shortcomings of thermochemical models are not the main reason for the discrepancies in the simulations and experiments for the high-enthalpy nitrogen double-cone flow.},

 abstract = {The current work presents the collision integral data for N(4 S)–N(4 S, 2 D, 2 P) and O(3 P, 1 D, 1 S)–O(3 P, 1 D, 1 S) interactions in the temperature range of 500–50 000 K. The collision integrals are calculated based on high-quality potential energy curves (PECs) obtained from fitting the high-level ab initio calculation data in a wide energy range to the neural network (NN) functions. In the construction of PECs, the diabatic PECs are adopted when avoided crossings exist because the diabatic paths are much more likely to be followed for such situations. Moreover, the nonadiabatic transition effects are estimated to be negligible for PECs crossings. The accuracy of traditional analytical formulas to fit PECs are also examined. It is found that the collision integral calculations are sensitive to the accuracy of PECs and the NN based PECs overwhelm the others. The contribution of inelastic excitation exchange processes to the diffusion collision integrals are also computed by using an accurate evaluation of the differences of PECs for gerade and ungerade pairs of excited atoms. Finally, based on the new collision integral data, we calibrate the collision model parameters suitable for the widely used particle simulation methods. The collision integrals and collision models developed in this work can be used to support high-confidence simulations of weakly ionized air plasma problems.},

 abstract = {In this study, complete (<i>i.e.</i>, including all vibrational quantum numbers in an N<sub>2</sub> vibrational ladder) data sets of vibration-to-vibration and vibration-to-translation rate coefficients for N<sub>2</sub>-N<sub>2</sub> collisions are explicitly computed along with transport properties (shear and bulk viscosity, thermal conductivity, and self-diffusion) in the temperature range 100-9000 K. To reach this goal, we improved a mixed quantum-classical (MQC) dynamics approach by lifting the constraint of a Morse treatment of the vibrational wave function and intramolecular potential and permitting the use of more realistic and flexible representations. The new formulation has also allowed us to separately analyze the role of intra- and intermolecular potentials on the calculated rates and properties. <i>Ab initio</i> intramolecular potentials are indispensable for highly excited vibrational states, though the Morse potential still gives reasonable values up to <i>v</i> = 20. An accurate description of the long-range interaction and the van der Waals well is a requisite for the correct reproduction of qualitative and quantitative rate coefficients, particularly at low temperatures, making physically meaningful analytical representations still the best choice compared to currently available <i>ab initio</i> potential energy surfaces. These settings were used to directly compute the MQC rates corresponding to a large number of initial vibrational quantum numbers, and the missing intermediate values were predicted using a machine learning technique (<i>i.e.</i>, the Gaussian process regression approach). The obtained values are reliable in the wide temperature range employed and are therefore valuable data for many communities dealing with nonlocal thermal equilibrium conditions in different environments.},

 abstract = {The time-dependent rotational and vibrational temperatures were measured to study the shock-heated thermal nonequilibrium behaviors of CO with Ar, He, and H2 as collision partners. Three interference-free transition lines in the fundamental vibrational band of CO were applied to the fast, in situ, and state-specific measurements. Vibrational relaxation times of CO were summarized over a temperature range of 1110-2820 K behind reflected shocks. The measured rotational temperature instantaneously reached an equilibrium state behind shock waves. The measured vibrational temperature experienced a relaxation process before reaching the equilibrium state. The measured vibrational temperature time histories were compared with predictions based on the Landau-Teller model and the state-to-state approach. The state-to-state approach treats the vibrational energy levels of CO as pseudo-species and accurately describes the detailed thermal nonequilibrium processes behind shock waves. The datasets of state-specific inelastic rate coefficients of CO-Ar, CO-He, CO-CO, and CO-H2 collisions were calculated in this study using the mixed quantum-classical method and the semiclassical forced harmonic oscillator model. The predictions based on the state-to-state approach agreed well with the measured data and nonequilibrium (non-Boltzmann) vibrational distributions were found in the post-shock regions, while the Landau-Teller model predicted slower vibrational temperature time histories than the measured data. Modifications were applied to the Millikan-White vibrational relaxation data of the CO-Ar and CO-H2 systems to improve the performance of the Landau-Teller model. In addition, the thermal nonequilibrium processes behind incident shocks, the acceleration effects of H2O on the relaxation process of CO, and the characterization of vibrational temperature were highlighted.},

 abstract = {A parametric study is carried out via state-to-state constant-volume heat bath simulations for binary mixtures of O 2/O and N 2/N to identify nonequilibrium de-excitation conditions where the overall atomic recombination is influenced by thermal nonequilibrium and where it is not. The most important parameter is found to be the translational temperature at which the de-excitation occurs. A low translational temperature of around 500 K is found to prevent the overall atomic recombination process from being influenced by the thermal nonequilibrium, due to the small value of KEQ making the dissociation reaction less important. At a higher translational temperature of 2000 K, the overall atomic recombination process is influenced by the thermal nonequilibrium to an extent that is comparable to that seen in the corresponding excitation conditions, due to the nonequilibrium-accelerated dissociation rate. The current results have important implications in reduced-order modelling and experimental methods.},

 abstract = {A merged potential energy surface (PES) is introduced for CO + CO collisions by combining a recent full-dimensional ab initio PES [Chen et al. J. Chem. Phys. 153, 054310 (2020)] and analytical long-range multipolar interactions. This merged PES offers a double advantage: it retains the precision of the ab initio PES in describing the van der Waals well and repulsive short range while providing an accurate physical description of long-range interaction; it significantly reduces the computational time required for trajectory integration since the long-range portion of the ab initio PES (involving numerous neural network fitting parameters) is now replaced by the analytical model potential. Based on the present merged PES, mixed Quantum-Classical (MQC) calculations, which capture quantum effects related to vibrational motion, align with a range of experimental data, including transport properties, vibrational energy transfer between CO and its isotoplogues, as well as rate coefficients for V-V and V-T/R processes. Notably, the original ab initio PES yields V-T/R rate coefficients at low temperatures that are significantly higher than the experimental data due to the artificial contribution of its unphysical long-range potential. In addition to conducting extensive MQC calculations to obtain raw data for V-V and V-T/R rate coefficients, we employ Gaussian process regression to predict processes lacking computed MQC data, thereby completing the considered V-V and V-T/R datasets. These extensive rate coefficient datasets, particularly for V-T/R processes, are unprecedented and reveal the significant role played by V-T/R processes at high temperatures, emphasizing the necessity of incorporating both V-V and V-T/R processes in the applications.},

 abstract = {Interactions between oxygen molecules play an important role in atmospheric chemistry and hypersonic flow chemistry in atmospheric entries. Recently, high-quality ab initio potential energy surface (PES) of the quintet O<sub>4</sub> was reported by Paukku et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 147, 034301 (2017)]. 10543 configurations were sampled and calculated at the level of MS-CASPT2/maug-cc-pVTZ with scaled external correlation. The PES was fitted to a many-body (MB) form with the many-body part described by the permutationally invariant polynomial approach (MB-PIP). In this work, the PIP-Neural Network (PIP-NN) and MB-PIP-NN methods were used to refit the PES based on the same data by Paukku et al. Three PESs were compared. It was found that the performances differ significantly in the O+O<sub>3</sub> region as well as in the long-range region. Therefore, additional 1300 points were sampled, and the efficient compressed-state multistate pair-density functional theory (CMS-PDFT) was used to calculate the electronic structure of these 1300 points and 10543 points by Paukku et al. Then, a completely new quintet PES was fitted using the MB-PIP-NN method. Based on this PES, the quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) approach was used to reveal all possible reaction channels for hyperthermal O<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>2</sub> collisions.},

 abstract = {Experimental and numerical studies were performed on the vibrational energy relaxation in shock-heated CO/N2/Ar mixtures. A laser absorption technique was applied to the time-dependent rovibrational temperature time-history measurements. The vibrational relaxation data of reflected-shock-heated CO were summarized at 1720-3230 K. In shock-tube experiments, the rotational temperature of CO quickly reached equilibrium, whereas a relaxation process was found in the time-dependent vibrational temperature. For the mixture with 1.0% CO and 10.0% N2, the vibrational excitation caused a decrease in the macroscopic thermodynamic temperature of the test gas. In the simulations, the state-to-state (StS) approach was employed, where the vibrational energy levels of CO and N2 are treated as pseudo-species. The vibrational state-specific inelastic rate coefficients of N2-Ar collisions were calculated using the mixed quantum-classical method based on a newly developed three-dimensional potential energy surface. The StS predictions agreed well with the measurements, whereas deviations were found between the Schwartz-Slawsky-Herzfeld formula predictions and the measurements. The Millikan-White vibrational relaxation data of the N2-Ar system were found to have the most significant impact on the model predictions via sensitivity analysis. The vibrational relaxation data of the N2-Ar system were then modified according to the experimental data and StS results, providing an indirect way to optimize the vibrational relaxation data of a specific system. Moreover, the vibrational distribution functions of CO and N2 and the effects of the vibration-vibration-translation energy transfer path on the thermal nonequilibrium behaviors were highlighted.},
