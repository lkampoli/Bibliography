 abstract = {Within a continuum framework, flows featuring shock waves can be modelled by means of either shock capturing or shock fitting. Shock-capturing codes are algorithmically simple, but are plagued by a number of numerical troubles, particularly evident when shocks are strong and the grids unstructured. On the other hand, shock-fitting algorithms on structured grids allow to accurately compute solutions on coarse meshes, but tend to be algorithmically complex. We show how recent advances in computational mesh generation allow to relieve some of the difficulties encountered by shock capturing and contribute towards making shock fitting on unstructured meshes a versatile technique.},

This new technique is able to work coupled with any unstructured vertex centred solver. The fitted shock front is described using a triangulated surface that is allowed to move, while obeying to the Rankine–Hugoniot jump relations, throughout a background tetrahedral mesh which covers the entire computational domain. At each time step, a local, constrained Delaunay tetrahedralization is applied in the neighbourhood of the shock front to ensure that the triangles, which make up the shock surface, belong to the overall tetrahedral grid. The fitted shock front acts as an interior boundary for the unstructured shock-capturing solver, used to solve the discretised governing equations in the smooth regions of the flow-field. The present algorithm has been tested against high speed flows past three-dimensional bodies, providing high quality results even using coarse grain tetrahedralization.},

In the present paper the attention is focused on those steady state reflections where the Von Neumann theory fails or does not provide the “classical” solution with incident and reflected shocks belonging to opposite families. Contrarily to the theory, numerical solutions of these problems show a Mach reflection similar to von Neumann triple point solution, provided that the computed shocks have a physical or numerical thickness. These special cases of Mach reflections are discussed with the help of numerical solutions obtained by different approaches based on shock capturing and shock fitting, respectively.},

 abstract = {The authors are currently involved in a national research project on turbomachinery CFD. One major goal of this project is to develop an accurate, robust and efficient methodology for the three-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations, based on a genuinely multidimensional upwind discretization of the Euler fluxes. In the last years, the first author has concentrated his efforts towards optimizing the efficiency of the solution procedure, using linear Fluctuation Splitting (FS) spacial discretizations of the Euler equations [1]. The method employs an implicit Euler time discretization and evaluates the Jacobian using either approximate analytical formulas (Picard linearisation) or two-point first- order-accurate differences. The resulting large sparse linear system is solved using a preconditioned GMRES strategy. The last three authors have developed and optimized a nonlinear hybrid formulation which, according to the local flow conditions, uses the most suitable FS spacial discretization among the matrix LDA and PSI schemes, which are optimal for subsonic and supersonic flow conditions, respectively, and the matrix N scheme, which is only first-order-accurate but can capture shocks monotonically [2]. Such a hybrid formulation employs a Runge- Kutta time integration procedure with multigrid and has been lately extended to the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations, using both an algebraic and a two-equation (k —w) turbulence model [3].},

The launcher model consisted of a cylinder with a circular cross section, an ogival nose, and a centered nozzle that issued a supersonic cold jet embedded in the external subsonic stream. A comparative analysis of the data obtained from the steady-state simulations and from the experimental tests indicated that the launcher base pressure was closely related to the turbulent shear stresses within the jet mixing layer; therefore, accurate modeling of the compressibility effects in the turbulent mixing layer plays an important role in improving the base drag estimates provided by the numerical simulations.},

 abstract = {The analysis of the rarefaction effects in the prediction of the main aerothermal loads of a space re-entry vehicle is presented. It is well known that the Navier–Stokes equations fail in rarefied regimes and therefore other approaches must be used. In the present paper different configurations have been simulated by using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method. Moreover, slip flow boundary conditions have been implemented in a Navier–Stokes code in order to extend the validity of such a continuum method in the transitional flow regime. Finally, bridging-formulae for the high altitude aerodynamics of winged bodies have also been used. For the tuning of the methodologies, two simple geometries have been analysed, specifically designed to study the phenomenon of shock wave boundary layer interaction: the first one is a hollow cylinder flare, for which experimental data are also available; the second one is the geometry of a test article that was designed and tested at the Italian Aerospace Research Centre. The other two configurations that have been taken into account are an experimental winged re-entry vehicle and a capsule, for which global aerodynamic coefficients and local wall heating have been determined using different computational approaches. The Navier–Stokes code with slip flow boundary conditions has shown good predictive capabilities of the size of the recirculation bubble compared with the experimental results in the hollow cylinder flare test case; however, for the winged vehicle and capsule case, the CFD results are not fully satisfactory and the Monte Carlo method remains the most reliable approach, together with the bridging formulae, that provide good results for the global aerodynamic coefficients.},

@article{pub.1062074403,
 abstract = {Abstract This paper describes an accurate, robust and efficient methodology for solving two-dimensional steady transonic turbomachinery flows. The Euler fluxes are discretized in space using a hybrid multidimensional upwind method, which, according to the local flow conditions, uses the most suitable fluctuation splitting (FS) scheme at each cell of the computational domain. The viscous terms are discretized using a standard Galerkin finite element scheme. The eddy viscosity is evaluated by means of the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence transport equation, which is discretized in space by means of a mixed FS-Galerkin approach. The equations are discretized in time using an implicit Euler scheme, the Jacobian being evaluated by two-point backward differences. The resulting large sparse linear systems are solved sequentially using a preconditioned GMRES strategy. The proposed methodology is employed to compute subsonic and transonic turbulent flows inside a high-turning turbine-rotor cascade.},

@article{pub.1064456156,
 abstract = {This article addresses two modelling aspects of wind turbine aerofoil aerodyna-mics based on the solution of the Reynolds-averaged Navier—Stokes (RANS) equations. One of these is the effect of an a priori method for structured grid adaptation aimed at improving the wake resolution. The presented results emphasize that the proposed adaptation strategy greatly improves the wake resolution in the far field, whereas the wake is completely diffused by the non-adapted grid with the same number and spacing patterns of grid nodes. The proposed adaptation approach can be easily included in the structured generation process of both commercial and in-house-structured mesh generators. The other numerical aspect examined herein is the impact of particular choices for turbulence modelling on the predicted solution. This includes the comparative analysis of numerical solutions obtained by using different turbulence models, and also aims at quantifying the solution inaccuracy arising from not modelling the laminar-to-turbulent transition. It is found that the drag forces obtained by considering the flow as transitional or fully turbulent may differ by 50 per cent. All these issues are investigated using a special-purpose hyperbolic grid generator and two multi block structured finite volume RANS codes. The numerical experiments consider the flow field past a wind turbine aerofoil for which an exhaustive campaign of steady and unsteady experimental measurements was conducted. The predictive capabilities of the CFD solvers are validated by comparing experimental data and numerical predictions for selected flow regimes. The incompressible analysis and design code XFOIL is also used to support the findings of the comparative analysis of numerical RANS-based results and experimental data.},

 abstract = {During past years, to improve the quality of wind tunnel data in transonic configurations, researchers first designed new wind tunnel geometries (as porous and/or slotted wind tunnels), then developed more accurate correction laws giving acceptable results in certain conditions but absolutely not sufficient to satisfy the increasing aeronautical requirements. Recent studies showed that the quality of wind tunnel data can be improved by using test sections provided with variable streamwise porosity distributions instead of the typical uniform ones. Some authors identified this new concept of variable porosity distribution as the third generation of porous wind tunnels. In order to improve knowledge about effects of the porosity distribution on the wall interference in subsonic/transonic conditions, an experimental investigation was carried out in the PT-1 CIRA transonic wind tunnel in the Mach range between 0.3 and 0.9 (over 400 test points were measured on different models and wall porosity configurations). At this aim, a dedicated experimental setup consisting in five plates positioned on the top and bottom walls of the PT-1 porous test section, has been designed and realized. Setting independently each plate, it is possible to obtain practically unlimited combinations of porosity distributions along the streamwise direction. The final purpose of the present activity was to evaluate the optimal porosity distribution able to minimize wind tunnel wall interferences in the considered Mach range. The huge number of factors (Mach number and the positions of the five plates setting the porosity distribution) made practically impossible to study the porosity distribution effects by using a traditional One Factor At a Time (OFAT) approach. Therefore, the optimum porosity distribution has been achieved through an experiment designed with a Modern Design of Experiment (MDOE) approach. Within the MDOE approach, the RSM (Response Surface Modeling) has been selected. The objective of the experiment, designed with the RSM approach, is to acquire a sufficient number of data to create one or more response surface models to be used to predict the response variable of interest (within a specified uncertainty) as function of the factors which can affect the selected response variables. The best porosity distribution able to improve the quality of wind tunnel data has been found for the PT-1 Wind Tunnel (but results and/or the procedure are applicable to all similar Wind Tunnels). In the present paper, to contextualize the activity, after a short summary of the historical wind tunnel development, the stat of art of the variable streamwise porosity distribution is discussed. Then, the experimental setup to simulate in wind tunnel several streamwise variable porosity distribution and the design of Experiment are described. Finally, the main experimental results are reported and critically analyzed.Copyright © 2012 by ASME},

 abstract = {The analysis of the rarefaction effects in predicting the main aero‐thermal loads of a Space re‐entry vehicle is presented. It is well known that the Navier‐Stokes equations fail in rarefied regimes and other approaches must be used. In the present paper different configurations have been simulated by using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method. Moreover, slip flow boundary conditions have been implemented in a Navier‐Stokes code in order to extend the validity of the continuum approach to the transitional flow regime. Finally, bridging formulas for high altitude aerodynamics of winged bodies have been used. Firstly, two simple geometries have been analysed, specifically designed to study the phenomenon of shock wave boundary layer interaction: a hollow cylinder flare, for which some experiments are available; and a blunt‐nosed flat plate/flap model designed and tested at the Italian Aerospace Research Centre. The other configurations taken into account are, respectively, an experimental winged re‐entry vehicle and a capsule, for which global aerodynamic coefficients and local wall heating have been determined with different approaches. The Navier‐Stokes code with slip flow boundary conditions has shown good predicting capabilities compared with experiments in the hollow cylinder flare case; however, for the winged vehicle and capsule cases, the CFD results are not fully satisfactory and the Monte Carlo method remains the most reliable approach, together with the bridging formula, that provides good results for the aerodynamic coefficients.},

@article{pub.1101526677,
 abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics codes using the density-based compressible flow formulation of the Navier–Stokes equations have proven to be very successful for the analysis of high-speed flows. However, solution accuracy degradation and, for explicit solvers, reduction of the residual convergence rates occur as the local Mach number decreases below the threshold of 0.1. This performance impairment worsens remarkably in the presence of flow reversals at wall boundaries and unbounded high-vorticity flow regions. These issues can be resolved using low-speed preconditioning, but there exists an outstanding problem regarding the use of this technology in the strongly coupled integration of the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations and two-equation turbulence models, such as the k − ω shear stress transport model. It is not possible to precondition only the RANS equations without altering parts of the governing equations, and there did not exist an approach for preconditioning both the RANS and the SST equations. This study solves this problem by introducing a turbulent low-speed preconditioner of the RANS and SST equations that does not require any alteration of the governing equations. The approach has recently been shown to significantly improve convergence rates in the case of a one-equation turbulence model. The study focuses on the explicit multigrid integration of the governing equations, but most algorithms are applicable also to implicit integration methods. The paper provides all algorithms required for implementing the presented turbulent preconditioner in other computational fluid dynamics codes. The new method is applicable to all low- and mixed-speed aeronautical and propulsion flow problems, and is demonstrated by analyzing the flow field of a Darrieus wind turbine rotor section at two operating conditions, one of which is characterized by significant blade/vortex interaction. Verification and further validation of the new method is also based on the comparison of the results obtained with the developed density-based code and those obtained with a commercial pressure-based code.},

 abstract = {Even though shock-capturing techniques are the de-facto standard in the CFD simulation of turbo-machinery flows, the accurate estimation of shock-induced losses in transonic flows can be severely hindered by the numerical errors that are generated along a captured shock and convected downstream. Indeed, and despite their widespread use, shock-capturing techniques are known to be plagued by a number of drawbacks that are inherent to the numerical details of the shock-capturing process.In recent works, the authors have developed a novel shock fitting technique for unstructured grids that has been applied to the computation of transonic, supersonic and hypersonic flows in both two and three space dimensions. In this paper, the proposed technique is applied to two-dimensional, transonic flows around an isolated profile and in a gas turbine cascade.It is shown that the use of unstructured meshes allows to relieve most of the algorithmic difficulties that have contributed to the dismissal of the shock-fitting technique in the framework of structured meshes. Moreover, it is confirmed that, in contrast to shock-capturing, shock-fitting allows to obtain very accurate solution on coarse meshes.},

 abstract = {Wind turbine leading edge erosion is a complex installation site-dependent process that spoils the aerodynamic performance of wind turbine rotors. This gradual damage process often starts with the formation of pits and gouges leading ultimately to skin delamination. This study demonstrates the application of open source parametric CAD functionalities for the generation of blade geometries with leading edge erosion damage consisting of pits and gouges. This capability is key to the development of high-fidelity computational aerodynamics frameworks for both advancing knowledge on eroded blade aerodynamics, and quantifying energy losses due to erosion. The considered test case is an offshore 5 MW turbine featuring leading edge pit and gouge damage in the outboard part of its blades. The power and loads of the nominal and damaged turbines are determined by means of a blade element momentum theory code using airfoil force data obtained with 3D Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamics. An annual energy loss between about 1 and 2.5 percent of the nominal annual energy yield is encountered for the considered leading edge damages. The benefits of adaptive power control strategies for mitigating erosion-induced energy losses are also highlighted.},

 abstract = {The detailed prediction of the upcoming wind on wind farms can support optimization of wind energy production and operation and maintenance. Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) tools allow to simulate the wind over long-term forecasting horizons (up to several days) with a spatial resolution ranging between the continental level down to a few hundred meters. We present a methodology, based upon Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) modelling, that allows to downscale the spatial resolution of the wind prediction supplied by a NWP model down to the typical length-scale of wind energy applications. The proposed approach combines a number of standard tools, including: Geographical Information Systems (GIS), Advanced Research - Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-ARW) and OpenFOAM, and proposes methods to interface these tools and set-up the local-scale simulation. Models and problem sizes are selected to keep the computational cost of the system sustainable in view of its implementation in operational forecasting. Finally, we present the application of the method on a given onshore site, and for three different meteorological conditions, showing the potential of the approach, but also giving an account of the limitations that it may encounter when dealing with complex planetary boundary layers.},

 abstract = {In this paper, a new shock-fitting technique based on unstructured dynamic grids is proposed to improve the performances of the unstructured “boundary” shock-fitting technique developed by Liu and co-workers in [1, 2]. The main feature of this new technique, which we call the “embedded” shock-fitting technique, is its capability to insert or remove shocks or parts thereof during the calculation. This capability is enabled by defining subsets of grid-points (mutually connected by lines) which behave as either “common”- or “shock”-points, shock-waves being made of an ordered collection of shock-points. Two different sets of flow variables, corresponding to the upstream and downstream sides of the shocks, are assigned to the shock-points, which may be switched to common- and back to shock-points, a feature that allows to vary the length of the existing shocks and/or make new shock-branches appear. This paper illustrates the algorithmic features of this new technique and presents the results obtained when simulating both steady and un-steady, two-dimensional flows.},

  Programming Language: UnDiFi-2D is written in standard Fortran 77/95; its
design is highly modular in order to enhance simplicity of use, maintenance and
allow coupling with virtually any existing CFD solver;
  Usability, Maintenance and Enhancement: In order to improve the usability,
maintenance and enhancement of the code also the documentation has been
carefully taken into account. The git distributed versioning system has been

 abstract = {Abstract Wind turbine blade leading edge erosion reduces the lift and increases the drag of the blade airfoils. This occurrence, in turn, reduces turbine power and energy yield. This study focuses on the aerodynamic analysis of large and sparse erosion cavities, observed in intermediate to advanced erosion stages, whose size and surface pattern do not lend themselves to experimental and numerical analysis by means of distributed roughness models alone. Making use of three‐dimensional Navier‐Stokes computational fluid dynamics enhanced by laminar‐to‐turbulent transition modeling, and geometrically resolving individual erosion cavities, the study validates this simulation‐based approach for predicting the aerodynamics and performance loss of blade sections featuring the aforementioned erosion cavities against available experimental data. It is found that the considered cavities can trigger transition, indicating the necessity of both resolving their geometry in the simulations and also modeling distributed surface roughness, of typically lower level, as this latter affects the properties of boundary layers and, if sufficiently high, may trigger transition over the entire spanwise length affected. The energy yield loss of a utility‐scale turbine due to the considered erosion pattern is found to be between 2.1% and 2.6% using measured and computed force data of the nominal and eroded outboard blade airfoil. A parametric analysis of the cavity geometry suggests that the geometry of the cavity edge has a much larger impact on aerodynamic performance than the cavity depth.},

 abstract = {Blade leading edge erosion is acknowledged to significantly reduce the energy yield of wind turbines. The problem is particularly severe for offshore installations, due to faster erosion progression boosted by harsh environmental conditions. This study presents and demonstrates an experimentally validated simulation-based technology for rapidly and accurately estimating wind turbine energy yield losses due to general leading edge erosion. The technology combines the predictive accuracy of two- and three-dimensional Navier–Stokes computational fluid dynamics with the runtime reductions enabled by artificial neural networks and wind turbine engineering codes using the blade element momentum theory. The main demonstration is based on the assessment of the annual energy yield of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory 5 MW reference turbine affected by leading edge erosion damage of increasing severity, considering damages based on available laser scans and previous leading edge erosion analysis. Results also include sensitivity studies of the energy loss to the wind characteristics of the installation site. It is found that the annual energy loss varies between about 0.3 and 4%, depending on the damage severity and the site wind characteristics. The study also illustrates the necessity of resolving the geometry of eroded leading edges rather than accounting for the effects of erosion with surrogate models, since, after an initial increase of distributed surface roughness, erosion yields leading edge geometry alterations causing aerodynamic losses exceeding those due to the loss of boundary layer laminarity consequent to roughness-induced transition. The presented technology enables estimating in a few minutes the amount of energy lost to erosion for many-turbine wind farms, and offers a key tool for predictive maintenance.},

During WWII, John von Neumann developed an analytical model of the Mach reflection which fits well the experiments, except when the incident shock is weak. This inconsistency is referred to in the literature as the von Neumann paradox. In this paper we combine numerical simulations performed using a shock-fitting CFD code and shock polar analysis to show that the triple-point that arises in the so-called fishtail shock-structure, which is observed in the transonic flow past airfoils, is not amenable to be described using von Neumann’s model. Our analysis points to the fact that Guderley’s four waves model, which has already been experimentally and numerically validated as a plausible solution to the von Neumann paradox, should be used instead.},

The technique presented here removes the tight link between grid topology and shock topology, which characterizes previous shock fitting as well as front tracking methods. This significantly simplifies their implementation and more importantly reduces the computational overhead related to these geometrical manipulations. Interacting discontinuities and shocks interacting with a solid boundary are discussed and analyzed. Finally, a quantitative investigation of the error reduction obtained with the approach proposed via a global grid convergence analysis is presented.},

 abstract = {Numerical simulation is an indispensable tool for the design and optimization of wind farms layout and control strategies for energy loss reduction. Achieving consistent simulation results is strongly related to the definition of reliable weather and sea conditions, as well as the use of accurate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models for the simulation of the wind turbines and wakes. Thus, we present a case study aiming to evaluate the wake-rotor interaction between offshore multi-MW wind turbines modelled using the Actuator Line Model (ALM) and realistic wind inflow conditions. In particular, the interaction between two DTU10 wind turbines is studied for two orientations of the upstream turbine rotor, simulating the use of a yaw-based wake control strategy. Realistic wind inflow conditions are obtained using a multi-scale approach, where the wind field is firstly computed using mesoscale numerical weather prediction (NWP). Then, the mesoscale vertical wind profile is used to define the wind velocity and turbulence boundary conditions for the high-fidelity CFD simulations. Sea waves motion is also imposed using a dynamic mesh approach to investigate the interaction between sea waves, surface boundary layer, and wind turbine wakes and loads.},

@article{pub.1152700037,
 abstract = {The computational power available nowadays to industry and research paves the way to increasingly more accurate systems for the wind resource prediction. A promising approach is to support the mesoscale numerical weather prediction (NWP) with high fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD). This approach aims at increasing the spatial resolution of the wind prediction by not only accounting for the complex and multiphysics aspects of the atmosphere over a large geographical region, but also including the effects of the fine scale turbulence and the interaction of the wind flow with the sea surface. In this work, we test a set of model setups for both the mesoscale (NWP) and local scale (CFD) simulations employed in a multi-scale modelling framework. The method comprises a one-way coupling interface to define boundary conditions for the local scale simulation (based on the Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes equations) using the mesoscale wind given by the NWP system. The wind prediction in an offshore site is compared with LiDAR measurements, testing a set of mesoscale planetary boundary layer schemes, and different model choices for the local scale simulation, which include steady and unsteady approaches for simulation and boundary conditions, different turbulence closure constants, and the effect of the wave motion of the sea surface. The resulting wind is then used for the simulation of a large wind turbine, showing how a realistic wind profile and an ideal exponential law profile lead to different predictions of wind turbine rotor performance and loads.},

@article{pub.1169050936,
 abstract = {We propose a novel approach to approximate numerically shock waves. The
method combines the unstructured shock-fitting approach developed in the last
decade by some of the authors, with ideas coming from embedded boundary
techniques. The numerical method obtained allows avoiding the re-meshing phase
required by the unstructured fitting method, while guaranteeing accuracy
properties very close to those of the fitting approach. This new method has
many similarities with front tracking approaches, and paves the way to
shock-tracking techniques truly independent on the data and mesh structure used
by the flow solver. The approach is tested on several problems showing accuracy
properties very close to those of more expensive fitting methods, with a
considerable gain in flexibility and generality.},

@article{pub.1169927874,
 abstract = {Slender profiles flying at nearly sonic speed exhibit a peculiar shock pattern, which is commonly referred to in literature as the “fishtail” shock structure. It consists of two oblique shock waves that originate at the trailing edge of the airfoil and interact with a detached, nearly normal shock wave in two triple points located along the oblique shocks. Making use of both shock-fitting and shock-capturing CFD simulations and classical shock polar analysis, we prove that, in the case of a NACA0012 airfoil, the two interaction points cannot be modeled using the three shocks theory that von Neumann developed nearly a century ago to describe triple points arising in Mach reflections. Our analysis suggests that the four-wave interaction model proposed by Guderley should be used instead.},
