 abstract = {A new set of ion and electron transport equations is proposed to simulate steady or unsteady quasi-neutral or non-neutral multicomponent weakly-ionized plasmas through the drift–diffusion approximation. The proposed set of equations is advantaged over the conventional one by being considerably less stiff in quasi-neutral regions because it can be integrated in conjunction with a potential equation based on Ohmʼs law rather than Gaussʼs law. The present approach is advantaged over previous attempts at recasting the system by being applicable to plasmas with several types of positive ions and negative ions and by not requiring changes to the boundary conditions. Several test cases of plasmas enclosed by dielectrics and of glow discharges between electrodes show that the proposed equations yield the same solution as the standard equations but require 10 to 100 times fewer iterations to reach convergence whenever a quasi-neutral region forms. Further, several grid convergence studies indicate that the present approach exhibits a higher resolution (and hence requires fewer nodes to reach a given level of accuracy) when ambipolar diffusion is present. Because the proposed equations are not intrinsically linked to specific discretization or integration schemes and exhibit substantial advantages with no apparent disadvantage, they are generally recommended as a substitute to the fluid models in which the electric field is obtained from Gaussʼs law as long as the plasma remains weakly-ionized and unmagnetized.},

@article{pub.1005899465,
 abstract = {Despite its success at simulating accurately both non-neutral and quasi-neutral weakly-ionized plasmas, the drift-diffusion model has been observed to be a particularly stiff set of equations. Recently, it was demonstrated that the stiffness of the system could be relieved by rewriting the equations such that the potential is obtained from Ohm's law rather than Gauss's law while adding some source terms to the ion transport equation to ensure that Gauss's law is satisfied in non-neutral regions. Although the latter was applicable to multicomponent and multidimensional plasmas, it could not be used for plasmas in which the magnetic field was significant. This paper hence proposes a new computationally-efficient set of electron and ion transport equations that can be used not only for a plasma with multiple types of positive and negative ions, but also for a plasma in magnetic field. Because the proposed set of equations is obtained from the same physical model as the conventional drift-diffusion equations without introducing new assumptions or simplifications, it results in the same exact solution when the grid is refined sufficiently while being more computationally efficient: not only is the proposed approach considerably less stiff and hence requires fewer iterations to reach convergence but it yields a converged solution that exhibits a significantly higher resolution. The combined faster convergence and higher resolution is shown to result in a hundredfold increase in computational efficiency for some typical steady and unsteady plasma problems including non-neutral cathode and anode sheaths as well as quasi-neutral regions.},

 abstract = {The paper addresses several problems of kinetics of spatially nonhomogeneous, vibrationally excited gas flows. It is shown that vibrational energy transfer in most diatomic molecules does not affect the transport coefficients of gas, despite very fast vibration-to-vibration (V—V) rates among high vibrational levels. The influence of diffusion and the vibration-to-electronic (V—E) energy transfer on the vibrational distribution function (VDF) and on the vibrational energy balance is discussed. The diffusion and V—E corrections of the VDF and to the gas heating rate in vibrational relaxation is obtained for the “strong” excitation regime. The effect of the non-local diagnostics on the VDF is connsdered. It is shown that the spatial integration may significantly influence the inferred distribution function, as has been previously reported in experiments. A new approach for kinetic modeling of nonhomogeneous, vibrationally nonequilibrium flows is suggested. A two-dimensional kinetic model is developed which combines vibrational and translational energy balance and gas motion equations with the analytical theory of anharmonic oscillators. The comparison of the model calculations with both 1D and 2D experiments shows reasonable agreement within the applicability of the gas flow model.},

In this plasma generation concept, collisional ionization of atoms and molecules by electron impact would play a negligible role. Analytical estimates as well as plasma kinetic modeling by particle-in-cell method with Monte Carlo collisions in argon confirm that this principle can enable substantial plasma densities at near-collisionless microgaps, while requiring relatively low voltages, less than 100 V. An order of magnitude increase in electron number density can be achieved due to enhancement of field emission at the cathode by positive space charge at high field ionization ion current densities.},

 abstract = {To date, fluid models of plasma sheaths have consisted of the coupling of the electric field potential equation obtained through Gauss’s law to the charged species conservation equations obtained through the drift–diffusion approximation. When discretized using finite-difference stencils, such a set of equations has been observed to be particularly stiff and to often require more than hundreds of thousands of iterations to reach convergence. A new approach at solving sheaths using a fluid model is here presented that reduces significantly the number of iterations to reach convergence while not sacrificing on the accuracy of the converged solution. The method proposed herein consists of rewriting the sheath governing equations such that the electric field is obtained from Ohm’s law rather than from Gauss’s law. To ensure that Gauss’s law is satisfied, some source terms are added to the ion conservation equation. Several time-accurate and steady-state cases of dielectric sheaths, anode sheaths, and cathode sheaths (including glow and dark discharges) are considered. The proposed method is seen to yield the same converged solution as the conventional approach while exhibiting a reduction in computational effort varying between one-hundred-fold and ten-thousand-fold whenever the plasma includes both quasi-neutral regions and non-neutral sheaths.},

 abstract = {Ionization in vibrationally excited CO is investigated. The carbon monoxide is excited by resonance absorption of CO laser radiation and subsequent vibration-vibration (V-V) pumping in an optical cell. Ionization involving CO molecules at high vibrational states occurs in the laser beam region. Thus, a non-self-sustained electric discharge (Thomson discharge), supported by the laser beam, is ignited between two plane electrodes placed in the cell. The applied voltage does not exceed the breakdown voltage for the cell gases. The measured discharge current is several microamperes. The discharge voltage-current characteristic satisfactory corresponds to the Thomson discharge theory. This allows measuring the ionization rate in the plasma with an accuracy of a factor of 2. The vibrational distribution function (VDF) of CO in the cell is measured by infrared emission spectroscopy. It is shown that the CO vibrational levels are strongly overpopulated up to level v=40. By adding helium to the CO-Ar mixture it is demonstrated that definite correlation exists between the discharge current and the high vibrational level populations. It is concluded that the ionization occurs in collisions of two vibrationally excited CO molecules. An ionization rate constant for this process of ki=(8±5)×10−15 cm3/s is inferred from the VDF measurements. Since the Thomson discharge environment allows regulation of the electron concentration by changing the applied voltage, it becomes possible to investigate the influence of electrons on the VDF. The effect of vibration-to-electron (V-e) coupling is measured in the experiment for the first time. This property of the Thomson discharge makes it very promising for a thorough investigation of the interaction between electrons and highly vibrationally excited molecules.},

 abstract = {As demonstrated by Parent, B., et al., (“Electron and Ion Transport Equations in Computational Weakly-Ionized Plasmadynamics,” Journal of Computational Physics, Vol. 259, 2014, pp. 51–69), the computational efficiency of the drift-diffusion plasma model can be increased significantly by recasting the equations such that the potential is obtained from Ohm’s law rather than Gauss’s law and by adding source terms to the ion transport equations to ensure that Gauss’s law is satisfied. Not only did doing so reduce the stiffness of the system, leading to faster convergence, but it also resulted in a higher resolution of the converged solution. The combined gains in convergence acceleration and resolution amounted to a hundredfold increase in computational efficiency when simulating nonneutral plasmas with significant quasi-neutral regions. In this paper, it is shown that such a recast of the drift-diffusion model has yet another advantage: its lack of stiffness permits the electron and ion transport equations to be integrated in coupled form along with the Favre-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. Test cases relevant to plasma aerodynamics (including nonneutral sheaths, magnetic field effects, and negative ions) demonstrate that the proposed coupled system of equations can be converged in essentially the same number of iterations as that describing nonionized flows while not sacrificing the generality of the drift-diffusion model.},

@article{pub.1022741306,
 abstract = {This study demonstrates the potential for shockwave–turbulent boundary layer interaction control in air using low current DC constricted surface discharges forced by moderate strength magnetic fields. An analytical model describing the physics of magnetic field forced discharge interaction with boundary layer flow is developed and compared to experiments. Experiments are conducted in a Mach 2.6 indraft air tunnel with discharge currents up to 300 mA and magnetic field strengths up to 5 Tesla. Separation- and non-separation-inducing shocks are generated with diamond-shaped shockwave generators located on the wall opposite to the surface electrodes, and flow properties are measured with schlieren imaging, static wall pressure probes and acetone flow visualization. The effect of plasma control on boundary layer separation depends on the direction of the Lorentz force (j × B). It is observed that by using a Lorentz force that pushes the discharge upstream, separation can be induced or further strengthened even with discharge currents as low as 30 mA in a 3-Tesla magnetic field. If shock-induced separation is present, it is observed that by using Lorentz force that pushes the discharge downstream, separation can be suppressed, but this required higher currents, greater than 80 mA. Acetone planar laser scattering is used to image the flow structure in the test section and the reduction in the size of recirculation bubble and its elimination are observed experimentally as a function of actuation current and magnetic field strength.},

@article{pub.1025469232,
 abstract = {Modeling of ambipolar diffusion and drift taking place within a weakly-ionized fluid can lead to some convergence difficulties when the ion conservation equation and the electric field potential equation are solved consecutively. A novel formulation of the ion flow rate is proposed here that reduces the computing effort to reach convergence by a factor of 10 or more. It is shown that by recasting the ion flow rate in terms of drift and ambipolar diffusion components, the sensitivity to the electric field is reduced hence alleviating the stiffness of the system of equations and permitting significantly faster convergence. What makes the method particularly appealing is that (i) it yields faster convergence without affecting the accuracy of the converged solution and (ii) it is not restricted to specific discretization or relaxation schemes and can hence be readily implemented in existing flow solvers. Because it is developed in general form (i.e. applicable to a multicomponent plasma in the simultaneous presence of electric current and magnetic and electric fields), the method is notably well-suited to simulate ambipolar diffusion within ionized multi-species flow solvers and is recommended for all flowfields as long as the plasma remains weakly-ionized and quasi-neutral.},

 abstract = {A variant of the generalized Ohm’s law that is suited for a weakly-ionized multicomponent plasma in a magnetic field is here derived. The latter takes into consideration the current due to the non-neutrality of the plasma, the current due to the Hall effect, and the currents due to the ion slip associated with each type of ion. An equation for the electric field potential applicable to a non-neutral multicomponent plasma in the presence of a magnetic field is then presented. Despite some similarities between the potential equation and the Poisson equation, it is argued that the discretization of the potential equation cannot be accomplished in the same manner by using only central differences. It is here proven (and subsequently verified through a test case) that when the plasma exhibits conjunctly a high Hall parameter and a high electrical conductivity gradient, the centered stencils introduce spurious oscillations which can lead to severe numerical error. A novel discretization of the potential equation consisting of a blend of central and upwind differences is then presented. The proposed scheme is consistently monotonic for any value of the Hall parameter and is second-order accurate except in the vicinity of discontinuities.},

 abstract = {A model is suggested for the analytical calculation of dissociation rates behind shock waves where the vibrational temperature Tv is less than the gas temperature T. The model is based on an analysis of the threshold translational energy for collision-induced dissociation as a function of initial vibrational and rotational energies. The threshold function method combined with a classical impulsive model for energy exchange yields explicit formulae for the rate coefficient k(Tv, T) and the mean vibrational energy removed in dissociation. The mechanism of nonequilibrium dissociation is predicted to change during vibrational relaxation: dissociation from low vibrational levels dominates at low Tv/T, while dissociation from all levels contributes almost equally as Tv/T approaches unity. The formulae obtained exhibit an explicit dependence on the mass ratio of the dissociating molecule and its collision partner, the lighter mass of the partner making dissociation from high levels more favorable. Dissociation in a molecular gas at T >Tv is demonstrated to occur predominantly via noncollinear collisions with simultaneous transfer of rotational and translational energy to the vibrational mode of the dissociating molecule.},

A pulse-sustained plasma with the ions driven by a DC bias voltage is proposed for optimum performance. While characterizing these devices, it was found that their performance is severely limited by surface charge build-up. That charge builds up rapidly and remains for as long as hours. Work in this paper shows that the surface charge can be mitigated by using a reversing DC bias potential or by using a constant DC bias potential with a partially covered electrode.},

@article{pub.1057693438,
 abstract = {A nonempirical, containing no adjustable parameters, theoretical model is suggested for calculations of state-specific dissociation rates in diatomic gases. Effects of molecular rotation and three dimensionality of collisions are consistently accounted for. The model is based upon a modified forced harmonic oscillator (FHO) scaling, with anharmonic frequency correction and energy symmetrization. The FHO scaling allows close-coupled calculations of multiquantum transitions between vibrational states, and it requires evaluation of collisional energy transfer to classical oscillator. Three-dimensional classical energy transfer models in both free-rotation and impulsive (sudden) approximations were used in conjunction with the FHO quantum scaling. The new theory describes the role of various degrees of freedom in dissociation both qualitatively and quantitatively. One of the predictions is that at low and moderate temperatures, dissociation is strongly preferential, with state-specific rates sharply increasing with vibrational energy; however, at high temperatures, the rate dependence on vibrational energy becomes less steep, turning into a virtually nonpreferential. Calculated thermal (equilibrium) and nonequilibrium dissociation rates of oxygen and nitrogen show a very good agreement with shock-tube experimental data taken from the literature.},

In the first regime, called a fountain, the charge is removed by the back current of plasma electrons toward the injection foil. In the second, called a thunderstorm, a substantial cloud of negative charge accumulates, and the increased electric field near the cloud causes a streamer to strike between the cloud and a positive or grounded electrode, or between two clouds created by two different beams. A quantitative analysis, including electron beam propagation, electrodynamics, charge particle kinetics, and a simplified heat balance, is performed in a one-dimensional approximation.},

 abstract = {Spark-generated shock waves were studied in glow discharges in argon and argon–nitrogen mixtures. Ultraviolet filtered Rayleigh scattering was used to measure radial profiles of gas temperature, and the laser schlieren method was used to measure shock arrival times and axial density gradients. Time accurate, inviscid, axisymmetric fluid dynamics computations were run and results compared with the experiments. Our simulation show that changes in shock structure and velocity in weakly ionized gases are explained by classical gas dynamics, with the critical role of thermal and multi-dimensional effects (transverse gradients, shock curvature, etc.). A direct proof of the thermal mechanism was obtained by pulsing the discharge. With a sub-millisecond delay between starting the discharge and shock launch, plasma parameters reach their steady-state values, but the temperature is still low, laser schlieren signals are virtually identical to those without the discharge, differing dramatically from the signals in discharges with fully established temperature profiles.},

 abstract = {The paper describes experimental and computational studies of weakly ionized air plasmas sustained by high repetition rate high-voltage nanosecond pulses. The experimentally determined energy cost per newly produced electron in these diffuse volumetric plasmas is on the order of 100eV, two orders of magnitude lower than in diffuse quasineutral dc and rf plasmas, and close to that in the cathode sheaths of glow discharges. Modeling of plasma dynamics in high-voltage nanosecond pulses yielded the energy cost of ionization in good agreement with the experimental values. Both experiments and modeling revealed that the ionization cost per electron in these plasmas is relatively insensitive to the gas density. Detailed investigations of the plasma dynamics revealed a critical role of the thin cathode sheath that was found to take up most of the peak voltage applied to the electrodes. The extremely high values of the ratio of electric field strength to the gas number density (E∕N), much higher than the Stoletov’s field at the Paschen minimum point, result in a very high ionization cost in the sheath. In contrast, the value of E∕N in the quasineutral plasma is closer to that associated with the Stoletov’s point, resulting in a near-optimal electron generation. This behavior (the reversal of ionization efficiencies in the sheath and in the plasma) is opposite to that in conventional glow discharges. The positive space charge in the sheath and its relatively slow relaxation due to the low ion mobility was also found to result in reversal of electric field direction in the plasma at the tail of the high-voltage pulse.},

 abstract = {Experimental studies were conducted of a flow induced in an initially quiescent room air by a single asymmetric dielectric barrier discharge driven by voltage waveforms consisting of repetitive nanosecond high-voltage pulses superimposed on dc or alternating sinusoidal or square-wave bias voltage. To characterize the pulses and to optimize their matching to the plasma, a numerical code for short pulse calculations with an arbitrary impedance load was developed. A new approach for nonintrusive diagnostics of plasma actuator induced flows in quiescent gas was proposed, consisting of three elements coupled together: the schlieren technique, burst mode of plasma actuator operation, and two-dimensional numerical fluid modeling. The force and heating rate calculated by a plasma model was used as an input to two-dimensional viscous flow solver to predict the time-dependent dielectric barrier discharge induced flow field. This approach allowed us to restore the entire two-dimensional unsteady plasma induced flow pattern as well as characteristics of the plasma induced force. Both the experiments and computations showed the same vortex flow structures induced by the actuator. Parametric studies of the vortices at different bias voltages, pulse polarities, peak pulse voltages, and pulse repetition rates were conducted experimentally. The significance of charge buildup on the dielectric surface was demonstrated. The charge buildup decreases the effective electric field in the plasma and reduces the plasma actuator performance. The accumulated surface charge can be removed by switching the bias polarity, which leads to a newly proposed voltage waveform consisting of high-voltage nanosecond repetitive pulses superimposed on a high-voltage low frequency sinusoidal voltage. Advantages of the new voltage waveform were demonstrated experimentally.},

 abstract = {In many cases, the widely used matrix inversion approach to describe the spectral interference in collisionally perturbed molecular spectra is not feasible if the particular molecular interactions do not allow the sudden impact approximation (infinitely short collision duration). To overcome this problem, we present a time domain model that describes collisional broadening and narrowing phenomena without requiring the sudden approximation. The key element of the model is a Monte Carlo type sampling process to quantify the temporal autocorrelation of the molecular dipole moment. The spectrum is then obtained numerically via fast Fourier transform. The model does not require a frequency-dependent relaxation operator; the finite collision duration is simply an adjustable parameter in the time domain process. Our approach, which is generally applicable to any set of transition lines, is derived from concepts of both conventional quantum-mechanical and semiclassical theory of line interference. Coherent transfer effects from rotationally inelastic collisions are described as randomly occurring events which affect frequency, amplitude, and phase of the sampled oscillation. Effects of vibrational dephasing are included as well. To demonstrate its feasibility, we apply the model here to the 2.7 μ absorption spectrum of carbon dioxide diluted in high density air (ρ=43–485 amagat, T=297–754 K). The successful modeling of the experimental data, especially the full collapse of P and R branches at ultrahigh densities, accounts for interbranch mixing and for incoherent effects. The calculations make extensive use of the new Hitran (HITEMP) molecular database. Results include revised estimates for the collision duration of CO2 with nitrogen and oxygen at room temperature.},

 abstract = {Minimization of the power required to sustain weakly ionized plasmas can be achieved if the energy of ionizing electrons is high, from tens to thousands of electronvolts. These electrons spend about a half of their energy on ionization cascades, in contrast to low-energy (1–3 eV) electrons in conventional discharges that dissipate most of their energy in nonionizing inelastic collisions. High-energy electrons can be injected into the gas as beams. Alternatively, they can be created in situ by applying a very strong electric field for a short time, with a repetition rate matching the rate of recombination. Analytical calculations show that the power budget in the high-voltage, repetitive pulse mode can be significantly lower than in the dc regime, but still much higher than in the case of electron beam ionization. For each pulse length, there exists an optimum electric field that minimizes the power budget. A detailed modeling of spatio–temporal dynamics of pulsed discharges reveal that voltage displacement into the cathode sheath plays a critical role. Fully coupled modeling of nonlocal kinetics of high- and low-energy electrons, ionization processes, charge particle transport, and electrodynamics was performed for a high-voltage pulse developing with a substantial pre-existing plasma. The kinetic modeling shows formation of a large group of high-energy electrons in high-voltage nanosecond pulse and dramatic increase in ionization rate. New effects are indicated, such as field reversal, “two-cathode” effect, and interpulse ionization.},

 abstract = {A microwave-transmission-based diagnostic method is presented here, applicable to plasmas having electron collision frequencies up to about twice their electron plasma frequency, and under the influence of an applied magnetic field. This technique is capable of measuring both electron number density and collision frequency. By varying the intensity of the applied magnetic field, the frequency of the upper hybrid resonance for transmission of extraordinary waves, as predicted by the Asher–Appleton–Hartree dispersion relation, is scanned through the microwave diagnostic frequency. Qualitatively, the zero transmission location of the resonant band depends on the electron number density, and the existence of the band depends on the collision frequency. Because there is essentially zero transmission through the resonant band, the measurement is accomplished by determining the ranges of microwave frequencies and magnetic field intensities that yield no transmission. In contrast to more standard techniques, the results presented here do not rely on accurate measurement of the transmission fraction or phase shift. The technique relies instead on measuring the applied field strengths and diagnostic frequencies that yield an opaque plasma. The opacity of the plasma can be robust with respect to the refraction, diffraction, multiple reflections, and impedance matching that can plague accurate measurements of microwave transmission fraction and phase shift, particularly in the case of small plasmas with near field geometries.},

 abstract = {A concept of plasma-enabled tuning of radio frequency systems is introduced and experimentally verified in this paper. Specifically, a commercial gas discharge tube (GDT) is employed as a plasma cell integrated in an inductor–capacitor (LC) resonator. The principal factor affecting the characteristics of the LC circuit with the embedded GDT, studied for the first time in this paper, is the decrease in the cathode sheath thickness and thus increase in the capacitance of the plasma cell with increasing current in the abnormal glow discharge regime. The reduction of plasma cell resistance is an additional factor. The sample LC resonator demonstrates frequency tunability by 55% in the range of 240–372 MHz, while the discharge current increases up to 90 mA, at the expense of reduction in quality factor from 62 to 5 as a result of ohmic losses. Theoretical estimates based on the fundamental principles of glow discharges supplemented by circuit simulations show good agreement with measurements. The local minimum in frequency behavior of the resonator’s quality factor is shown to be related to frequency-dependent plasma parameters. The results of this paper indicate that plasma tuning techniques could be a viable alternative for emerging applications.},

The proposed limiter is composed of a high- $Q$ evanescent-mode cavity resonator loaded with a gas discharge tube in its gap area over the post. Increasing input power results in enhancing electric field over the gap, which eventually leads to microwave gas breakdown and plasma formation. The limiter loss after the breakdown depends on the electron density in the tube, which itself is a function of input power. Hence, the limiting mechanism is self-sustained. The threshold power is tunable either coarsely by selecting different tubes with various breakdown voltages or finely by dc biasing the tube. In a fabricated proof-of-concept limiter at 2.16 GHz with 22% bandwidth, preionization by an external dc bias provided 15.5 dB of limiting power tunability in the range of 370 mW–13 W, while the limiter could easily handle up to 100-W input power. The response time of this limiter is <10 ns. Thanks to the nature of capacitively coupled microwave gas discharge in the $ \alpha $ -discharge regime, the limiter performance is quite stable and no degradation was observed after a long operation under high input power.},

 abstract = {Abstract
Rate constants for the Boudouard reactions: CO + CO → CO2 + C and CO + CO → C2O + O, involving ground and vibrationally excited states for both singlet–singlet and singlet–triplet reactant CO molecules, have been obtained by using the transition-state theory on an ab initio generated potential energy surface. The dependence of the activation energies for the different processes on the vibrational energy of reactants has been estimated through a parametrization that accounts for the utilization of vibrational energy and is calculated by the forward and backward ab initio activation energies of the relevant processes at zero vibrational energy. The results and their comparison with available experimental reaction rates demonstrate the importance of vibrational excitation not only for the singlet–singlet reactions, but also for the singlet–triplet ones, which are here investigated for the first time. Finally, the implications of the present results on the kinetics of CO/CO2 cold plasmas are discussed: for their modeling the temperature dependence of the obtained rates for singlet–singlet and singlet–triplet reactants in the ground vibrational states have been represented by both Arrhenius and deformed Arrhenius equations.

 abstract = {Summary form only given. Stable and long-lived atmospheric-density air plasmas with high electron densities are interesting for many applications. One of the difficulties in creating such plasmas at low temperatures is that electrons very quickly attach to oxygen, thus limiting the electron density. Another important factor limiting electron density and gas pressure is the ionization-heat instability, resulting in arcing. In the present paper we discuss methods of suppressing attachment and controlling instabilities based on the excitation of metastable molecular states. Enhanced population of metastable states may stimulate ionization in both electron-molecule and molecule-molecule collisions, and accelerate electron detachment from negative ions. Metastable states could also define the path of arc formation, allowing external control of arc location and timing.},

 abstract = {A weakly ionized plasma region is, in general, a dispersive electromagnetic medium whose properties depend on, among other quantities, the plasma electron number density and gas pressure. Such frequency-dependent cold plasma properties include permittivity, conductivity, and thicknesses of its quasi-neutral and sheath regions. If the excitation frequency is much smaller than the plasma frequency, plasma tends to behave as a good conductor. On the other hand, if the plasma frequency is much smaller than the operating frequency, plasma behaves more like a transparent layer to electromagnetic waves. In the range between these two extremes, plasma is a lossy dielectric medium. It is in the range though that high frequency tunability can also be achieved. In this talk, we will first review the aforementioned regimes for cold plasmas and their electromagnetic properties. Several experimentally-validated plasma-based tunable RF devices such as tunable resonators, variable attenuators and reconfigurable power limiters will be discussed. Advantages and drawbacks of each approach will also be highlighted. Plasma jets and gas discharge tubes are employed as plasma cells in our designs. Reconfiguration is achieved by controlling either the excitation voltage or the discharge current. The presented results demonstrate the potential of this approach as an alternative tuning technique particularly in emerging applications where conventional solid-state techniques are ineffective due to high temperature, high power, or linearity issues.},

Specifically, the GDT is implementing a variable capacitor in a lumped LC resonator. The electron number density and consequently the electromagnetic properties of plasma are controlled by varying the magnitude of the excitation field. In this work we also theoretically and experimentally investigate the tunability-RF loss trade-off. The fabricated GDT LC resonator at 305 MHz shows 26% of tunability while the discharge current increases up to 75 mA. The resonator's quality factor varies between 43.7-2.0 for the same range. However, a quality factor above 10 can be maintained if the tuning range is reduced to 4 %. The results reveal that this technique could be a suitable tuning scheme for applications where other technologies fail due to high-power or harsh-environment requirements.},

 abstract = {High-energy electron beams can create nonequilibrium plasmas with power budget 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than that of electric field-sustained discharges. We analyze kinetics and dynamics of plasmas generated in dense gases by beams of keV-class electrons with beam current density on the order of 1-10 mA/cm/sup 2/. Of specific interest is the case when the beam relaxation length is considerably less than the distance to the anode or other conducting objects. The paper focuses on a “fountain” regime where the space charge of the beam is removed by the back current of plasma electrons towards the injection foil. 1D modeling couples electron beam propagation, electrodynamics, charge particle kinetics, and kinetics of chemical species and molecular excited states. Kinetics of high-energy electrons is described in the ‘forward-back’ approximation developed by us earlier, while the drift-diffusion approximation is used for low-energy electrons. Temporal and spatial evolution of electron and ion densities, electric field, electron energy distribution function, and densities of chemical species and molecular excited states are computed. In the regime when attachment to oxygen is largely balanced by detachment processes, electric field in the plasma is found to be very low, so that electron temperature of plasma electrons is only about 0.1 eV or lower. Because of that, vibrational excitation is much weaker than in conventional nonequilibrium discharges where electron temperature is about 1-3 eV. The low electron temperature also results in excitation and dissociation processes being driven by beam electrons, with virtually no role of plasma electrons. The results of calculations are compared with recent experimental results obtained in the laboratory, and a good agreement is found.},

 abstract = {The Air Plasma Ramparts MURI goal is to sustain a volume-filling, nonequilibrium plasma with an electron number density of 1013 electrons/em3in atmospheric pressure air at temperatures at or below 2000 K, with the minimum expenditure of power. That minimum depends directly on the energy cost of ionization. In this paper, approaches to minimize the cost of ionization are examined. It is well understood that the most practical ionization mechanism is through collisions of electrons with neutral species. The cost of ionization as a function of the electron energy indicates that there is more than a two order of magnitude reduction in power required if the plasma is sustained by high energy electrons. These electrons can be supplied from outside the plasma by the use of electron beams, or from within the plasma by short, repetitively-pulsed, very high voltage acceleration of thermal electrons between collisions with neutral gas molecules. Electron beams offer the possibility of sustaining single electrode plasma “fountains” or plasma “thunderstorms,” and generate stable, non-filamentary, volume-filling plasmas. Electron beams are approximately a factor of two more efficient than the best that can be achieved with pulse sources, but they must enter the plasma through windows whose losses can easily offset that advantage. High voltage, subnanosecond length pulses at repetition rates of more than 100 KHz avoid the window problem.},

The plasma jet generates a pre-ionized region over the post of the cavity where most of the electric field is concentrated on. Due to pre-ionization, microwave breakdown occurs at a lower power level compared with the no-plasma case. During microwave breakdown the high electron density in the cavity causes high RF loss and consequently results in a power limiting behavior. The proposed technique has been examined in a 7.36-GHz EVA cavity resonator tested with incident power up to 56 W. Arc discharge occurs beyond 56 w causing high reflection levels of the RF signal. The proposed plasma-based approach can be employed in the future as a power limiting technology particularly in challenging applications where conventional techniques cannot be used due to temperature, power, or linearity constraints.},

 abstract = {Summary form only given. We report the possibility of measuring the neutral gas temperature profile of a weakly ionized plasma by using ultraviolet Rayleigh scattering together with an atomic resonance filter containing mercury vapor. The neutral gas temperature is one of the most important properties since it directly influences the EM ratio, which in turn, determines all of the plasma parameters. In addition, there has been much recent interest in acoustic and shock wave propagation through weakly ionized plasmas, where the temperature profile plays a critical role. To accomplish the temperature profile measurement, the plasma is illuminated with a high power, very narrow linewidth, pulsed ultraviolet laser, which is tuned into resonance with mercury atomic vapor. The Rayleigh scattering from the plasma is imaged through a mercury atomic vapor cell by an ultraviolet-sensitive camera system. The light scattered from the plasma is thermally broadened by the Doppler motion of the neutral species, and the total scattering intensity is proportional to the neutral species number density. The mercury vapor filter is operated in the optically thick regime and acts both to block background laser scattering from the test chamber, and to generate signals from which neutral species density and temperature can be extracted.},

The electric field in the cavity was kept below that needed for self-initiated breakdown. When ArF laser beam (15 ns pulse, 50 mJ/pulse) was focused at a location inside the waveguide, the streamer started and continued to grow long after the laser pulse, reached the waveguide wall and persisted to the end of the microwave pulse. The streamer followed the track of the laser beam rather than the electric field. The paper describes the observed dynamics of the streamer and the theoretical interpretation in detail. The paper also describes the development of a laboratory-scale supersonic wind tunnel with microwave plasma. In the tunnel, a 2D dielectric nozzle is mounted inside the microwave waveguide, so that the flow direction coincides with that of the microwave propagation.},

 abstract = {It has been proposed that one way of reducing the sonic boom is to deposit energy upstream of the vehicle. A computational and experimental study has been carried out on the near-field flow around a wedge model placed in a Mach 2.4 wind tunnel, where a Nd:YAG laser beam is used to breakdown the air upstream of the wedge, leading to a hot spot of gas which interacts with the wedge oblique shock. These interactions are studied with the help of time-resolved Schlieren (using a MHz rate camera) and using four sequentially placed pressure sensors, located in the region of impingement of the oblique shock on the floor; here they measure the effect of the energy deposition on the shock-induced pressures on the floor. 2D Euler calculations are compared with the wind tunnel results. Both numerical and experimental results agree quite well in the relative pressure levels before and after the shock impingement position, and also in the qualitative behavior of the pressure levels as a function of time after the discharge. The presence of other extraneous shocks and also the well-developed, large, turbulent boundary layer on the tunnel floor hindered a further quantitative comparison of experimental and computational results.},

 abstract = {Summary form only given. as follows. Nanosecond breakdown and the so-called fast ionization wave in gases was studied by several groups. In those studies, the gas was not preionized by the beginning of the pulse. We analyze dynamics of plasmas sustained by ultrahigh-voltage (with E/N above the electron runaway threshold) pulses with high repetition rate, so that each pulse begins with pre-existing plasma. In contrast with nanosecond breakdown, strong current instantaneously develops in the entire volume, forming a cathode sheath. Interesting spatio-temporal evolution of the plasma is revealed with a fully coupled model where ionization kinetics is strongly coupled with ion and electron motion in a self-consistent nonuniform electric field and with non-local electron energy distribution function (EEDF). EEDF is calculated in the “forward-back” approximation. The modeling demonstrated that rapidly evolving redistribution of the potential creates conditions for electron high-voltage pulses which can reach about 100 eV, and the EEDF develops a long plateau extending to hundreds and thousands eV. High-energy electrons far from the cathode are not produced locally, but rather arrive from the sheath. The new predicted phenomena include reversal of the electric field in the anode half of the discharge gap and double-peak profiles of mean electron energy and ionization rate. Ionization and excitation of molecules continue and could even peak after the pulse, with no voltage, as the high-energy electrons move into the gas. We also explore a new way of plasma generation by ultrashort, high-power, repetitive laser pulses, with ionization efficiency comparable to that of e-beams. The idea is to accelerate free electrons remaining from the previous pulse to keV due to high quiver energy in laser field, before collisions and plasma polarization (this imposes upper limits on pulse duration and laser wavelength). Suppressing tunneling ionization imposes a lower limit on the wavelength. The accelerated electrons act like a beam and ionize the surrounding gas.},

 abstract = {In strong shock waves in rarefied gases, chemical processes such as dissociation and exchange reactions occur in conditions of thermodynamic nonequilibrium, and the rate coefficients are functions of both translational–rotational and vibrational temperatures. In this work, we reexamine and validate the physical model for nonequilibrium dissociation rates proposed earlier by Macheret et al. The model is based on the classical impulsive approximation and enables analytical formulas for reaction thresholds, probabilities, and multitemperature rate coefficients. The recent quasi-classical trajectory calculations for N2–N2, N2–N, N2–O, O2–O2, and O2–O are used to evaluate the Macheret–Fridman dissociation model. The full version of the model that incorporates the reduction of dissociation energy due to rotation of the dissociating molecule as well as the appearance of the centrifugal barrier is found to be in good agreement with quasi-classical trajectory data, whereas the simplified version of the model that ignores the rotational effect significantly underpredicts the dissociation rates in vibrationally cold conditions. The good agreement with quasi-classical trajectory data validates the classical impulsive approximation and implies that details of the potential energy surface are not important for dissociation at high temperatures. Preliminary one-dimensional computational fluid dynamics calculations with the validated dissociation model were conducted for conditions of the shock-tube experiments in pure oxygen by Ibraguimova et al. Generally reasonable agreement was found between the calculations and the experimental data; however, some underprediction of the peak vibrational temperature suggests that some improvement in the model would be desirable.},

 abstract = {Weakly ionized plasmas in argon and nitrogen in a parallel-plate electrode configuration at a gas pressure of several Torr were sustained by repetitive nanosecond pulses with the pulse repetition frequency sufficiently high to ensure that the plasma does not fully decay between the pulses. In order to measure the electron number density decay in the afterglow of each pulse, a custom-constructed 58.1 GHz homodyne microwave interferometer was used. Initial analysis of the measured electron density decay indicates that dissociative recombination with molecular and cluster ions was the dominant electron loss mechanism for both gases, and that the electron thermalization was significantly faster than the decay of their density. The plasma with low electron temperature between the pulses could potentially be used to reduce the Johnson–Nyquist thermal noise in plasma antennas.},

 abstract = {Microwave breakdown of gas and formation of plasma can be a destructive effect that limits power handling of highfrequency devices and circuits with small gaps 1, 2. When such plasma is formed, the insulated air gaps are transformed into conductive regions. Although this phenomenon can result in performance degradation or even device failure, it can alternatively be useful for some high power devices such as limiters 3, attenuators 4 and switches. In microwave-induced plasma, the incoming wave is employed for plasma ignition, and hence there is no concern about power consumption. Also, microwave-driven plasma can operate in the α-discharge regime 5 even at atmospheric pressure and thus requires lower operating voltage and power 6 and has much higher stability and much longer lifetime in comparison with dc plasma 3.},

 abstract = {An implementation of the Macheret-Fridman (MF) dissociation model for the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is developed in this work. The model maintains the fundamental physical assumptions of the MF model, i.e., that high-energy collisions resulting in dissociation can be described by classical mechanics and are close to the impulsive limit, but also eliminates additional approximations of the MF model by using Monte Carlo sampling. Recent quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) calculations of N2, O2, and NO dissociation reactions and experimental measurements are used to validate the model. In general, the reaction rate constants and average vibrational energy removed at thermal equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions are in good agreement with the QCT and experimental values. The discrepancies in the absolute values of thermal equilibrium rate constants found in some cases are shown to be caused by the underprediction of collision rates with the variable hard sphere model rather than by the MF model itself. QCT-calibrated collision rates combined with the MF dissociation model for the N2+O colliding pair are shown to yield a very good agreement between the computed thermal equilibrium dissociation rates and the QCT results. The model is also evaluated by simulating shock tube experiments with oxygen. The present study suggests the possibility of using the model as the standard dissociation reaction model for nonequilibrium flows.},

The influence of trace amounts of water on the electron temperature and density decay was studied by solving electron energy and continuity equations. In pure argon, Ar+ ions dominate, the electron temperature is very slow to thermalize, and the recombination of electrons is also very slow. The presence of trace amounts of water impurity drastically reduces the electron thermalization time and increases the rate of recombination.

 abstract = {Nanosecond-pulse electrical discharges offer an efficient means of plasma generation in applications, but accurate numerical simulation of these discharges remains extremely challenging. The continuing difficulties lie in an enormous separation of space and time scales, a lack of transport and kinetic data, and extreme nonequilibrium physics. In the face of these challenges, we present an example of good practice in selecting the physical model and comprehensively checking numerical accuracy. We focus on a particular discharge experiment, and illustrate how simulations can provide useful guidance for ongoing experimental work, despite the difficulty of the simulations. The target experiments were carried out in a plane-to-plane electrode configuration with a 20 mm gap in 400 Pa (3 Torr) argon using 3 ns, 850 V pulses with a 30 kHz pulse repetition frequency. The model employed the drift-diffusion approximation for species motion, and the self-consistent electric field was obtained through the solution of the Poisson equation. The baseline physical model utilized the local field approximation. In an extended model, non-local-field effects on the electron temperature were investigated by solving a simplified electron energy equation. Calculations were carried out for both a pure argon kinetic model and an argon-water model. The model generally underestimated the measured electron number densities, but the inclusion of additional physical effects helped to reduce the discrepancy with experiment. These results represent a step toward efficient modeling of pulsed electrical discharges for applications to combustion enhancement, flow control, and plasma antennas.},

The system operates at moderate pressures (less than 30 mbar) with an 80 kHz square wave voltage input. The computational model aids the understanding of plasma properties and α–γ transition parameters which strongly influence the nanostructure deposition characteristics in the system. A 1D plasma model is developed to characterize the effects of input voltage, gas pressure, frequency, and waveform on the plasma properties. A hybrid mode which displays the characteristics of both α and γ discharges is found to exist for the low cycle frequency 80 kHz square wave voltage input due to the high frequency harmonics associated with a square waveform. The modeled gas temperatures are 22.5% higher than the experimentally measured values due to the presence of molecular species in the experiments. Collision radiative modeling is performed to predict the argon emission intensity in the discharge gap. The results are found to lie within 16% of the optical emission spectroscopy measurements with better agreement at the center of the discharge, where the measurement uncertainty is low and the emission by ions is not significant.},

In this work, experiments were conducted with capacitively-coupled RF discharge in the alpha regime using parallel-plate electrode geometry in air at 1 Torr with an RF amplifier operating at a constant voltage in a wide range of frequencies, 20–120 MHz. The impedance characteristics and the sheath and plasma parameters were inferred from the current and voltage measurements supplemented with optical imaging. The experimental data show that the sheath thickness is approximately inversely proportional to the excitation RF frequency, so that the capacitance is proportional to the frequency, in agreement with a simple theory. In applications, tuning the sheath thickness by varying the excitation RF frequency could be used to control the impedance variation in a different range of probing RF frequencies, including control of the transition from capacitive to inductive behaviour.},

 abstract = {Estimates of energy and power requirements for shortening the ignition delay time in hydrocarbon-fueled scramjet engines using nonequilibrium plasma generation of radicals show that the uniform volumetric plasma ignition would be associated with extremely high power budget and substantial losses of total pressure. A multipoint plasma ignition scheme based on electron beams is proposed that would emulate the volumetric ignition while reducing the power budget by several orders of magnitude. The paper also explores an approach where the fuel is injected into the core flow as a liquid jet, and low-power electron beams are used to electrostatically charge the droplets and thus to control droplet breakup, atomization, mixing, and ignition. With a subcritical microwave field applied to the injection region, local enhancement of electric field strength at the surface of droplets, together with seed electrons and ions produced by the electron beam, would create subcritical microwave discharges and thus initiate combustion in multiple spots. The multispot ignition would help in spreading the flame across the combustor. Additionally, the initiation of combustion at the droplet surface, where local equivalence ratio is high, could help ignite lean (in average) mixtures.},

The reflection coefficient, deposited power, and the antenna transmission and reception gains were measured for an argon plasma at 0.3 torr sustained by radio frequency power up to 150 W at an excitation frequency of 98 MHz. These measurements were performed through a single RF connector with the help of a directional coupler circuit that isolated the high-power excitation signal from the low-power probing ones. It was found that the resonant frequency of this plasma antenna could be tuned over a span of 80 MHz by varying the applied power in the range of 10–150 W. The antenna gain could also be varied with applied power. At power levels exceeding 40 W, the gain approached, within 3 dB, that of a standard reference antenna. The experimental setup was modeled using ANSYS HFSS software. The simulation and experimental results were found to be in good agreement.

 abstract = {A concept of plasma-based reconfigurable radio-frequency (RF) components is studied experimentally. The concept's main idea is to control the real and imaginary parts of impedance experienced through a weak high-frequency signal applied to the RF discharge electrodes by varying the plasma excitation frequency and/or power. To prove the concept, an experimental setup was built that enabled the application of both strong plasma excitation RF and weak RF/microwave signals to the same set of electrodes. Three different plasma cells were examined. The largest system had 5 cm diameter electrodes with 2 cm gap, and the experiments were conducted in argon at 1 Torr. The impedance characteristics of the plasmas as experienced by the probing signal in the range of 270–3000 MHz demonstrated wide variability and a complex non-monotonic behavior at high frequencies. Experiments with a smaller cell that had 1 cm diameter electrodes and 2 mm gap also showed the controllability of the real and imaginary parts of the impedance, including transition from capacitive to inductive behavior. Because of the smaller size comparable with the probing signal wavelength, the high-frequency behavior of this system can be described with a simple lumped-parameter equivalent circuit model. The smallest system studied in this work utilized a commercial sealed gas discharge tube as an RF plasma cell and also demonstrated wide impedance tunability and transition from capacitive to inductive behavior. These results could potentially be useful for plasma-based electronically reconfigurable RF electronics, particularly in applications involving high power where alternative solutions experience problems.},

In this work, experimental studies of plasmas generated by 800 V, 2 ns, 10–100 kHz pulses in argon and nitrogen at pressures of 1–10 Torr in a parallel-plate electrode configuration were conducted. A 60 GHz microwave interferometry system was constructed and used to provide time-resolved, spatially-averaged electron number densities in order to study plasma decay between the pulses. Time-resolved voltage and current measurements were also performed.},

The study was conducted to assess whether magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) could boost aerodynamic lift and/or drag for aerocapture of a spacecraft into planetary orbit. MHD seemed well suited to create Lorentz forces during aerocapture when the flow is most ionized and conductive. Neptune and Mars were selected since larger payloads and faster trip times to each planet may substantially increase scientific and exploration opportunities. The results of the systems analysis presented herein suggest that a single MHD effector located off-centerline creates steering forces equaling whole-body aerodynamic forces and suggests a ground-breaking opportunity for new mission classes.

 abstract = {We report the deposition of nanocrystalline graph- itic films on Cu foil in a roll-to-roll (R2R) plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system. The influence of discharge modes on the graphitic film synthesis is studied in radio frequency (RF) capacitively coupled Ar/H2/CH4 plasma. First, electrical and spectroscopic characterizations supported with modeling are carried out to study the properties of hybrid and gamma modes in Ar plasma at an excitation frequency of 80 kHz. A hybrid mode, which exhibits both alpha and gamma characteristics, exists at 950 Pa for Ar plasma at powers up to 1100 W. However, Ar plasma transitions at 1380 Pa from hybrid to gamma mode when the power is greater than 750 W. Second, the quality of the nanocrystalline graphitic films, which is assessed with Raman spectroscopy, is correlated with the characteristics of hybrid and gamma modes in Ar/H2/CH4 plasma. The hybrid mode in Ar/H2/CH4 plasma has relatively less ion bombardment. However, the gamma mode in Ar/H2/CH4 plasma provides abundant intermediate carbon species and heats the Cu substrate directly to around 1193 K. Hence, thin films of nanocrystalline graphite with different qualities can be produced at a web feed rate of 30 mm/min without supplemental heating by adjusting the discharge modes.},

Specifically, the electron collision frequency is inferred via phase information from microwave scattering off microplasmas operating in the mixed collisional-Thomson scattering regime. We further suggest the combination of phase and amplitude measurements to derive total electron counts and temperatures in small plasmas. An experimental validation of this concept is performed by 10.5 GHz CMS off laser-induced, variable-pressure oxygen and air plasmas.},
