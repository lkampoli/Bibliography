 abstract = {In an effort to establish the optimum conditions for depositing high-quality diamond films at high deposition rates using a plasma torch, modelling work has been focused on developing a realistic model for determining temperature, velocity and particle density distributions in the plasma jet. To enhance molecular decomposition, which favourably improves diamond synthesis, high-speed gas is passed through a supersonic anode nozzle. In the subsequent low-pressure chamber, the chemical reactions cannot follow the fast macroscopic translation, resulting in distributions of dissociated precursors that are far from chemical equilibrium. To simulate the finite rate chemistry, a generalized implicit multi-component algorithm is introduced and examined in the context of a two-dimensional computational model of a chemically reacting Ar- supersonic plasma jet. The scheme can be adapted to other plasma flows in which chemical non-equilibrium is encountered.},

 abstract = {Abstract The high temperatures encountered at hypersonic speeds trigger complex thermochemical effects in the surrounding medium and have a substantial impact on the vehicle. In addition to the excitation of internal energy modes, chemical reactions such as dissociation and ionization may also occur. The resultant species can then interact with the vehicle surface to produce diverse thermal effects. In this chapter, some of the main concepts are summarized. The notion of nonequilibrium is introduced and related to collisionality. The mechanisms by which chemical reactions occur, the rates at which they proceed, their effect on momentum and energy balance and the coupling between internal energy and chemistry are exposed by deriving the principal conservation equations. Methods of obtaining the equation of state, as well as various transport properties such as viscosity and thermal conductivity are presented. The chapter concludes with an illustrative example of a waverider vehicle traveling at Mach 8.},

@article{pub.1005076196,
 abstract = {A hybrid approach that combines a continuum approach solving the Navier–Stokes equations and a particle method called the information preservation (IP) method is implemented to simulate subsonic, rarefied gas flows accurately and efficiently. The coupling between the continuum and particle approaches relies on a continuum/particle interface, which is investigated in detail. The IP method preserves information at the macroscopic level that allows the continuum approach to directly use the information from the particle region. In order to correctly generate particles from the continuum region, two strategies are proposed. One strategy adopts a Marshak-type condition, which requires many particles in a cell to control the flux fluctuation due to the microscopic motion of particles. In the second strategy, reservoir cells and buffer cells are used, and this is the approach adopted in our general hybrid scheme. The location of the interface is determined using a continuum breakdown parameter. Studies show that the continuum breakdown parameter suggested by Garcia et al. can be used to determine the location of the interface, but the implementation of the interface also affects the location of the interface. Simulation of a flow over a flat plate shows the performance of the hybrid approach and reveals the effects of the cutoff value to a continuum breakdown parameter. This approach is also applied to study the aerodynamics of a micro-scale airfoil, which is very difficult for a single method. The hybrid approach generally spends less computational time than the IP method for rarefied gas flows, and the numerical performance of the hybrid approach depends on the number ratio of continuum cells to particle cells.},

@article{pub.1007938719,
 abstract = {We propose a new implicit computational fluid dynamics method for steady-state compressible reacting flows. The concept is to decouple the total mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations from the species mass and internal energy equations and to solve the two equation sets sequentially. With certain approximations to the implicit system, it is possible to dramatically reduce the cost of the solution with little to no penalty on the convergence properties. Importantly, the cost of the decoupled implicit problem scales linearly with the number of species, as opposed to the quadratic scaling for the conventional fully coupled method. Furthermore, the new approach reduces the memory requirements by a significant factor. The decoupled implicit method shows promise for the application to aerothermodynamics problems and reacting flows.},

 abstract = {This work examines numerical simulation of supersonic, subsonic, and transonic flows over a bluff body using several numerical techniques. Comparisons between computational fluid dynamics predictions and wind-tunnel test data are shown. The wind-tunnel test used a 7.66%-scale model of the crew module for NASA’s multipurpose crew vehicle. A variety of freestream conditions consisting of three Mach numbers and three angles of attack are considered. The wind-tunnel test data include time-averaged integrated forces and moments, static pressure port measurements, and unsteady frequency response. Results obtained using the Spalart–Allmaras Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes turbulence model are compared to solutions computed using detached-eddy simulation. Furthermore, low-dissipation numerical fluxes are applied in order to assess their effect on solution fidelity. Across the cases examined, the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes model has difficulty matching the vehicle surface pressures. For supersonic and transonic flows, detached-eddy simulation agrees well with the experiment. Subsonic flows still prove difficult for the methods explored in this work, but detached-eddy simulation and low-dissipation numerical fluxes provide the most accurate prediction of the test data.},

 abstract = {Time-developing turbulent boundary layers over an isothermal flat plate at free-stream Mach numbers of 0.3 and 0.7 are computed using an explicit finite-difference method on structured multi-block grids. The size of each block is adjusted depending on the dimension of the largest structures present locally in the flow. This results in substantial savings of memory and CPU time, compared to standard single-block methods. The near-wall region is computed using a smaller domain, repeated periodically in the spanwise direction. The outer layer, which contains larger structures, is computed using a domain that is twice as wide. Although the flow at the interface between the blocks has a periodicity length determined by the inner-layer block, within a few grid points longer wavelengths are generated. The velocity statistics and rms intensities compare well with single-block calculations that use substantially more grid points.},

 abstract = {A robust, implicit, low-dissipation method suitable for LES/DNS of compressible turbulent flows is discussed. The scheme is designed such that the discrete flux of kinetic energy and its rate of change are consistent with those predicted by the momentum and continuity equations. The resulting spatial fluxes are similar to those derived using the so-called skew-symmetric formulation of the convective terms. Enforcing consistency for the time derivative results in a novel density weighted Crank–Nicolson type scheme. The method is stable without the addition of any explicit dissipation terms at very high Reynolds numbers for flows without shocks. Shock capturing is achieved by switching on a dissipative flux term which tends to zero in smooth regions of the flow. Numerical examples include a one-dimensional shock tube problem, the Taylor–Green problem, simulations of isotropic turbulence, hypersonic flow over a double-cone geometry, and compressible turbulent channel flow.},

The resulting diagonal and full matrix data-parallel LU relaxation methods display good stability and convergence properties on many perfect gas and reacting flows. Both methods are implemented in data-parallel on the thinking machines CM-5, where they exhibit high parallel efficiency and perfect scalability. Their formulation makes the methods easy to implement in either data-parallel or message-passing modes, and therefore they should be portable to a variety of different parallel architectures. The chapter emphasizes that floating point performance on the CM-5 is primarily a function of the number of grid points per processor, due to the vector nature of the machine. The chapter concludes that the high parallel efficiency, low memory requirements, and numerical stability of the data-parallel LU relaxation methods make them potentially useful for the solution of very large perfect gas and reacting flow simulations.},

In recent times with the advent of supercomputers and new experimental imaging techniques, terabyte scale data sets are being generated, and hence storage as well as analysis of this data has become a major issue. In this chapter we outline a new approach to tackling these data-sets which relies on selective data storage based on real-time feature extraction and utilizing data mining tools to aid in the discovery and analysis of the data. Visualization results are presented which highlight the type and number of spatially and temporally evolving coherent features that can be extracted from the data sets as well as other high level features.},

The formulation of the implicit method and the corresponding tunable parameters are introduced. The numerical simulation results are compared with the results given by explicit Runge–Kutta schemes, theoretical results, and published experimental and numerical data. An assessment of the accuracy and performance of the method to simulate turbulent flows is made for temporally decaying isotropic turbulence and subsonic and supersonic turbulent boundary layers. Whereas no significant advantage over typical explicit time integration methods are found for the incompressible flows; it is shown that the implicit scheme yields significant reduction in computer cost while assuring time-accurate solutions for compressible turbulence simulations.},

 abstract = {Recent experiments focused on the hypersonic boundary-layer transition process have been conducted at Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s free-piston High Enthalpy Shock Tunnel facility. Numerical simulations of the experiments were conducted to generate mean-flow solutions upon which boundary-layer stability analyses were performed. These computations included the effects of chemical reactions and internal energy relaxation. The disturbances in the boundary layer were calculated by solving the linear parabolized stability equations. Comparisons of transition location, disturbance amplification rates, and disturbance frequencies were made between those measured experimentally and those calculated from the stability analysis. The results suggest that an N factor of 8.0 is the value that indicates the onset of transition for this facility. A disturbance frequency comparison between the computations and experiment showed a reasonable agreement for the locations at which the flow remained laminar. Additional theoretical operational conditions were examined to investigate effects of finite-rate chemistry and vibrational excitation. For the conditions examined, the inclusion or exclusion of chemical kinetics modeling in the mean-flow solution influenced boundary-layer stability to a greater extent than the inclusion or exclusion of chemical kinetics in the stability analysis alone. In general, the inclusion of these effects increased disturbance frequencies, peak amplification rates, and the distance over which the disturbance frequencies were amplified.},

 abstract = {An optimization routine using computational fluid dynamics is outlined and applied to axisymmetric aeroshells in hypersonic entry conditions. Two objectives are considered in the optimization: minimizing the peak heat flux at the wall and maximizing the drag coefficient. These objectives are scaled and combined into a single scalar quantity called the objective function. A weight is applied to each objective to study the tradeoff effect that the objectives have on the shape. A Pareto front is produced by varying the weight between 0 and 1 and plotting the optimal shapes. Pareto fronts are generated in three environments: laminar perfect gas air, turbulent perfect gas air, and a nine-species Mars environment. The optimal aeroshells are compared with the Mars Science Laboratory aeroshell. The optimal aeroshells generated in the two perfect gas air environments compare similarly with the Mars Science Laboratory aeroshell. The optimal aeroshells generated in the Mars atmosphere show significant deviations from the Mars Science Laboratory aeroshell. Significant reductions in heat flux and small increases in drag coefficient are seen from the optimal aeroshells. These optimal aeroshells are spherical Apollo-like aeroshells.},

@inbook{pub.1024169072,
 abstract = {The chapter focuses on two aspects of the solver, as well as the parallel performance of the hybrid implicit method. A new parallel implicit solver for the solution of the compressible Navier–Stokes equations with finite rate chemistry on unstructured finite volume meshes is presented in the chapter. The solver employs the data-parallel line relaxation (DPLR) method for implicit time integration along the lines of cells that are normal to the wall. A point-implicit method is used in the regions where surface-normal lines are not constructed. The new method combines the robustness and efficiency of the implicit DPLR method with the flexibility of using unstructured discretizations. The solver employs a low-dissipation pure-upwind numerical scheme based on the Steger-Warming split flux method, as well as a MUSCL-type scheme designed for unstructured discretizations. The DPLR method is superior to other parallel methods, such as matrix-based point-implicit methods designed for chemically reacting hypersonic flow simulations.},

@article{pub.1026261516,
 abstract = {In the recent work of Prof. Hans Hornung, expressions for the gradients of flow properties immediately behind a curved shock wave were obtained for a reacting gas [1]. In this paper, I use the expressions derived by Hornung to compare with inviscid computational fluid dynamics simulations of a Mach 8 flow over a cylinder. A finite-rate vibrational relaxation model is used to simplify the comparisons with theory. The shape of the bow shock wave is extracted from the CFD results, fitted with a polynomial, and then used to compute the post-shock gradients of the main flow variables. It is found that in general the CFD results are in very good agreement with the theory for both perfect gas and vibrationally relaxing flows. There are some notable differences, mostly centered on the location of the change in sign of the post-shock density gradient; this quantity is found to be highly sensitive to the relaxation rate of the gas. The theoretical post-shock gradients provide a rigorous test of CFD and suggest possible experiments that would be a very sensitive test of the models of finite-rate vibrational and chemical processes.},

@article{pub.1028216356,
 abstract = {Over the past two decades or so, there have been many advances in the numerical simulation of hypersonic flows, with most effort focused on the development of upwind methods to produce accurate heat transfer rates for steady-state laminar and turbulent flows. With parallelizable implicit methods, it is now possible to obtain full-vehicle solutions at reasonable computational cost. This paper reviews several of the most widely used approaches and discusses how the methods have been tuned to control numerical errors for strongly shocked flows. The paper also discusses recent methods from the incompressible turbulence simulation literature that have been adapted to compressible flows. These methods have dramatically lower levels of numerical dissipation and have been extended to high-order accuracy on smoothly varying hexahedral grids. The increased accuracy of these methods enables the solution of complex physics unsteady hypersonic flows.},

 abstract = {In this paper we discuss how thermo-chemical nonequilibrium models must be chosen to suit specific hypersonic flows. Current models can be very complicated, involving a large chemical kinetics model and many internal energy modes. Also, realistic hypersonic flows have a very large range of length scales, making them difficult to simulate with computational methods. Therefore, it is important to use thermo-chemical models that are appropriate; the models should have sufficient complexity to capture the relevant properties of the flow, with a minimum of computational cost. Thus, there is no single thermo-chemical model that is appropriate for all re-entry flows, and more complicated models may not be useful because they make the problem computationally intractable.},

 abstract = {Time-developing turbulent boundary layers over an isothermal flat plate at free-stream Mach numbers of 0.3 and 0.7 are computed using an explicit finite-difference method on structured multi-block grids. The size of each block is adjusted depending on the dimension of the largest structures present locally in the flow. This alleviates the cost of calculations in which the wall layer is resolved, and may result in substantial savings of memory and CPU time, if several layers are used. In the calculations presented the near-wall region is computed using a domain with a spanwise length L+o=820, which is sufficient to contain several streaks. This grid block is repeated periodically in the spanwise direction. The outer layer, which contains larger structures, is computed using a domain that is twice as wide (L+o=1640). Although the flow at the interface between the blocks has a periodicity length determined by the inner-layer block, within a few grid points longer wavelengths are generated. The velocity statistics and rms intensities compare well with single-block calculations that use substantially more grid points.},

 abstract = {Introduction Hypersonic flows are synonymous with high-Mach number flows and therefore are characterized by very strong shock waves. Every hypersonic vehicle has a bow shock wave in front of it, which bounds the flow around the vehicle. On the windward side of a vehicle, the bow shock usually is aligned closely with the vehicle surface, and the distance between the surface and the shock wave is usually small relative to the characteristic dimension of the vehicle. Thus, this shock-layer region is usually quite thin. Hypersonic vehicles tend to fly at high altitudes so that convective heating levels can be managed. Thus, the characteristic Reynolds numbers tend to be low and boundary layers are usually thick. In addition, shear heating in hypersonic boundary layers increases the temperature and viscosity, which also increases the thickness. The low Reynolds number and the relative stability of hypersonic boundary layers mean that many practical hypersonic flows are laminar or transitional. If the flow is turbulent, it is often only marginally turbulent. Therefore, hypersonic flows are particularly susceptible to shock wave–boundary-layer interactions (SBLIs).},

 abstract = {Numerical simulations are performed on a spherical capsule model based on the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle and compared to experimental data obtained at the Calspan University of Buffalo Research Center. The flow is at Mach 6.4, and a case with an angle of attack of 28 deg is considered. The interest is in predictions of afterbody heating in the presence of massive separation and the resultant highly unsteady wake flow. Detached-eddy simulations of this flowfield are done using several flux schemes, and the effect of mesh refinement is considered. The results are compared to experimental data for mean and fluctuating heat transfer in the separated portion of the afterbody. Comparisons of instantaneous flow features are presented to illustrate varying levels of resolved scales.},

@article{pub.1035454729,
 abstract = {The aerodynamic mechanism of early transition phenomena over an ablating reentry capsule has been analytically examined. A two-equation turbulence model (k–ε model) was coupled with Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes equations. Low-Reynolds-number effects on the solid wall were taken into account by modifying the Chien's correction. As a result, transition occurred at the lower Reynolds number with higher ablation rate. The predicted transition-point Reynolds number was 3×104 at the surface-mass-injection rate of 100g/sm2. The principal mechanism of this early transition is thought as follows; the viscosity damping effects are reduced and re-laminarization is prevented in the downstream of the capsule surface, due to the turbulence on the surface and due to the pushing out of near-surface stream-lines from the surface by successive mass injection.},

The experiments, obtained in a new free-piston shock tunnel, show the value and limitations of binary scaling in very good agreement with the numerical computations. The use of spherical models eliminates end-effect problems previously encountered with cylindrical models. Global quantities, such as the bow shock stand-off distance, follow binary scaling very well. The results include differential interferograms and surface heat transfer measurements of nitrogen, air and carbon dioxide flows.},

@article{pub.1044631052,
 abstract = {In celebration of the first 60 years of the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, several studies of hypersonic flows dominated by rate-dependent energetic processes are revisited. The work presented shows the evolution and advancement of computational capabilities in this area, and illustrates some key lessons learned over the previous decade or so. Early work with Leyva and Hornung in the California Institute of Technology T5 Free-Piston Shock Tunnel had the goal of validating thermochemical models for high-enthalpy flows. Several of these flows are re-analyzed with more advanced numerical methods, resulting in improved comparisons with the experimental measurements. This work was followed by a series of experiments in the Calspan-University at Buffalo Research Center (now CUBRC Inc.) facilities at lower enthalpy conditions. Initial comparisons were poor, but with a better understanding of the facility behavior and the inclusion of key finite-rate processes, excellent agreement was obtained for nitrogen flows. An interesting study related to plasmadynamics and finite-rate processes in a different type of flow is discussed. Finally, it is shown that recent advances in numerical methods that are beginning to enable the direct numerical simulation of key rate-dependent energetic processes in hypersonic flows.},

 abstract = {Gauss-Seidel line relaxation is used to solve an implicit flux split difference approximation to the Navier-Stokes equations. The flux split approximation is chosen to maximize the weight of the diagonal elements of the block matrix elements that need to be inverted iteratively by the Gauss-Seidel procedure. There are several flux split approximations that can be chosen. However, not all are suitable for viscous flows containing shear or boundary layers. The present paper will illustrate the adverse effects of flux splitting in viscous flow calculations and propose corrections. The numerical procedures will be applied to solve for subsonic laminar flow past a flat plate, turbulent flow past a cone at March 6, and chemical and thermal nonequilibrium flow past a sphere-cone body at March 18.},

 abstract = {A numerical model has been developed to analyze arc-anode attachment in direct-current electric arcs. The developed model fully couples a plasma flow with electromagnetic fields in a self-consistent manner. Electrons and heavy species are assumed to have different temperatures. Species continuities are taken into account to address the chemical nonequilibrium with the Self-Consistent Effective Binary Diffusion (SCEBD) formulation. Electric and magnetic field equations are determined with a newly developed Ohm’s law, an improvement over the conventional generalized Ohm’s law. The governing equations are discretized and solved using the Finite Volume Method (FVM) and Gauss–Seidel Line Relaxation (GSLR) method in a two-dimensional domain. The model is applied to a two-dimensional axisymmetric high-intensity argon arc. The results are compared favorably with experimental and other numerical data. A significant electric potential drop has been observed in the vicinity of the anode due to the thermal and chemical nonequilibrium effects.},

@article{pub.1049227898,
 abstract = {In this work, the interaction between the internal energy states and the dissociation/recombination process for a diatomic molecule is studied in detail. In particular, the state-specific recombination and dissociation rate constants are derived as a function of internal energy distribution and other molecular parameters. As a special case, applying this result with specific vibrational energy distributions, we obtain the classic Marrone and Treanor models. An information theory approach to obtain the initial recombination distribution for any diatomic molecule is also presented. The general idea is to incorporate the vibrational and the rotational effects in the dissociation and recombination process without a full vibrational-rotational state-specific model. The effect of this rovibrational coupling is to produce an initial recombination distribution that is biased to the high internal energy states. These initial recombination distributions are then thermally averaged to obtain temperature-dependent expressions for different diatomic molecules to characterize the internal energy distribution of recombining molecules.},

 abstract = {Numerical simulation has been used to study the fluid dynamics and chemical kinetics in a supersonic nozzle situated downstream of a plasma reactor. To assist in system scale-up and optimization, effective nozzle design can help in maximizing the transport of chemically active species to the substrate. This paper examines the chemical non-equilibrium of the flow, the effect of different flow parameters, and the effect of different nozzle geometries. A three species hydrogen-argon gas mixture was modeled with finite dissociation and recombination. Non-equilibrium transport and thermodynamic mixture properties based on species pair collision cross sections were implemented. Running a plasma torch off design power can significantly alter power losses through the nozzle wall and subsequently change the species distribution at the nozzle exit. Decreasing the effective nozzle throat diameter can notably decrease atomic concentrations. Small changes in upstream or downstream pressures have a negligible effect on supersonic species transport through the nozzle. Flow separation can be avoided by correctly designing the divergent portion of the nozzle.},

Photographs from other studies, which do not mention mist at all, strongly suggest that copious amounts of mist are formed at the earliest stages of fragmentation. In this paper, we present arguments and calculations which indicate that this mist is formed from condensed vapour arising from the flash vaporization of the hot and low-pressure liquid on the leeside of the drop. Low leeside pressures are produced by the rarefaction of the gas, the acceleration of the drop, and the high tensions generated by rapid stretching of the stripped liquid. The droplet temperature may rise because of heat transfer from the hot gas to thin drop filaments, and by viscous heating due to rapid deformation.},

We use the interaction of homogeneous isotropic turbulence with a normal shock to suggest improvements in the k–ε model applied to shock/turbulence interaction. Mahesh et al. [J. Fluid Mech. 334, 353 (1997)] and Lee et al. [J. Fluid Mech. 340, 22 (1997)] present direct numerical simulation (DNS) and linear analysis of the flow of isotropic turbulence through a normal shock, where it is found that mean compression, shock unsteadiness, pressure-velocity correlation, and up-stream entropy fluctuations play an important role in the interaction. Current RANS models based on the eddy viscosity assumption yield very high amplification of the turbulent kinetic energy, k, across the shock. Suppressing the eddy viscosity in a shock improves the model predictions, but is inadequate to match theoretical results at high Mach numbers. We modify the k equation to include a term due to shock unsteadiness, and model it using linear analysis. The dissipation rate equation is similarly altered based on linear analysis results. These modifications improve the model predictions considerably, and the new model is found to match the linear theory and DNS data well.},

In addition, the dependence of the rate constant on the N2 internal state is studied. It is found that a low vibrational excitation can reduce the rate constant of this reaction by a factor of 3. Also, we investigate the effect of the N2 vibrational state on the product NO vibrational distribution, and it is found that at low N2 vibrational states, the NO vibrational distribution is nearly Boltzmann. However, at N2(v≳10), the product distribution is almost uniform at low energy levels.},

 abstract = {Fitting potential energy surfaces to analytic forms is an important first step for efficient molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we present an improved version of the local interpolating moving least squares method (L-IMLS) for such fitting. Our method has three key improvements. First, pairwise interactions are modeled separately from many-body interactions. Second, permutational invariance is incorporated in the basis functions, using permutationally invariant polynomials in Morse variables, and in the weight functions. Third, computational cost is reduced by statistical localization, in which we statistically correlate the cutoff radius with data point density. We motivate our discussion in this paper with a review of global and local least-squares-based fitting methods in one dimension. Then, we develop our method in six dimensions, and we note that it allows the analytic evaluation of gradients, a feature that is important for molecular dynamics. The approach, which we call statistically localized, permutationally invariant, local interpolating moving least squares fitting of the many-body potential (SL-PI-L-IMLS-MP, or, more simply, L-IMLS-G2), is used to fit a potential energy surface to an electronic structure dataset for N4. We discuss its performance on the dataset and give directions for further research, including applications to trajectory calculations. },

@article{pub.1058094465,
 abstract = {Accurate modeling of high-temperature hypersonic flows in the atmosphere requires consideration of collision-induced dissociation of molecular species and energy transfer between the translational and internal modes of the gas molecules. Here, we describe a study of the N2 + N2⟶N2 + 2N and N2 + N2⟶4N nitrogen dissociation reactions using the quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) method. The simulations used a new potential energy surface for the N4 system; the surface is an improved version of one that was presented previously. In the QCT calculations, initial conditions were determined based on a two-temperature model that approximately separates the translational-rotational temperature from the vibrational temperature of the N2 diatoms. Five values from 8000 K to 30,000 K were considered for each of the two temperatures. Over 2.4 × 10(9) trajectories were calculated. We present results for ensemble-averaged dissociation rate constants as functions of the translational-rotational temperature T and the vibrational temperature T(v). The rate constant depends more strongly on T when T(v) is low, and it depends more strongly on T(v) when T is low. Quasibound reactant states contribute significantly to the rate constants, as do exchange processes at higher temperatures. We discuss two sets of runs in detail: an equilibrium test set in which T = T(v) and a nonequilibrium test set in which T(v) < T. In the equilibrium test set, high-v and moderately-low-j molecules contribute most significantly to the overall dissociation rate, and this state specificity becomes stronger as the temperature decreases. Dissociating trajectories tend to result in a major loss of vibrational energy and a minor loss of rotational energy. In the nonequilibrium test set, as T(v) decreases while T is fixed, higher-j molecules contribute more significantly to the dissociation rate, dissociating trajectories tend to result in a greater rotational energy loss, and the dissociation probability's dependence on v weakens. In this way, as T(v) decreases, rotational energy appears to compensate for the decline in average vibrational energy in promoting dissociation. In both the equilibrium and nonequilibrium test sets, in every case, the average total internal energy loss in the dissociating trajectories is between 10.2 and 11.0 eV, slightly larger than the equilibrium potential energy change of N2 dissociation.},

 abstract = {The direct molecular simulation (DMS) approach is used to predict the internal energy relaxation and dissociation dynamics of high-temperature nitrogen. An ab initio potential energy surface (PES) is used to calculate the dynamics of two interacting nitrogen molecules by providing forces between the four atoms. In the near-equilibrium limit, it is shown that DMS reproduces the results obtained from well-established quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) analysis, verifying the validity of the approach. DMS is used to predict the vibrational relaxation time constant for N2–N2 collisions and its temperature dependence, which are in close agreement with existing experiments and theory. Using both QCT and DMS with the same PES, we find that dissociation significantly depletes the upper vibrational energy levels. As a result, across a wide temperature range, the dissociation rate is found to be approximately 4–5 times lower compared to the rates computed using QCT with Boltzmann energy distributions. DMS calculations predict a quasi-steady-state distribution of rotational and vibrational energies in which the rate of depletion of high-energy states due to dissociation is balanced by their rate of repopulation due to collisional processes. The DMS approach simulates the evolution of internal energy distributions and their coupling to dissociation without the need to precompute rates or cross sections for all possible energy transitions. These benchmark results could be used to develop new computational fluid dynamics models for high-enthalpy flow applications.},

 abstract = {Within shock waves, the translational motion of the gas is more energetic in the direction perpendicular to the shock than in the direction parallel to the shock. To represent this translational nonequilibrium, new continuum conservation equations are developed. These equations are derived by solving the Boltzmann equation with a first-order Chapman–Enskog expansion of an anisotropic velocity distribution function. This results in a gas model with anisotropic pressure, temperature, and speed of sound. The governing equations are solved numerically for one-dimensional steady shock waves in a Maxwellian gas. The numerical results are compared to those obtained using the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. The new continuum model captures many of the features of shock waves. In particular, this paper finds that translational nonequilibrium is present at all Mach numbers. For Mach numbers greater than 1.5, the perpendicular temperature overshoots the post-shock temperature. At the point where this temperature reaches a maximum, the model predicts that for any shock wave, the square of the perpendicular-direction Mach number is one-third; this is substantiated by the DSMC results.},

 abstract = {Vibration–dissociation coupling in low-density, hypersonic flows of air is investigated. Radiative emission data for nitric oxide and for atomic oxygen measured by a reentry flight experiment are used to assess the modeling of this phenomenon. Flow field computations are performed using the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. Due to the relatively small number of collisions under high-altitude, low-density flow conditions, an overlay approach is used to simulate changes in chemical composition of trace species, including both nitric oxide and atomic oxygen. Radiative emission is calculated using a nonequilibrium radiation method. It is found that the strong degree of thermal nonequilibrium that occurs in high-altitude, hypersonic flows makes the chemistry very sensitive to the vibration–dissociation coupling model. A number of such models based on continuum and particle representations of the flow are assessed. A variation in dissociation rate of up to nine orders of magnitude among these models is found for the lowest-density flight conditions. By using a sophisticated dissociation model, the emission calculated at the highest altitude for which measurements are available is improved from a factor of 220 too low to within a factor of 4 too low. With the same model, improvement by a factor of 50 is also obtained for the computation of emission from atomic oxygen. This is the first time that the observed dependence of the flight data on the free-stream density has been predicted correctly.},

Phys. 104, 2825 (1996)] is used to model the kinetics of the primary NO formation reaction, N2+O→NO+N, in hypersonic nonequilibrium flows. The QCT data are used to obtain expressions for the thermal rate constant, reactant energy removal, and product energy disposal rates of this reaction. The QCT results are coupled with the continuum conservation flow equations, and these equations are used to simulate the Bow-Shock UltraViolet2 (BSUV2) flow at altitudes between 75 to 87.5 km. It is found that the use of the Macheret and Rich [Chem. Phys. 174, 25 (1993)] vibration–dissociation coupling model along with the QCT rates gives improvements in the NO concentration predictions at altitudes between 80 and 85 km. Also, it is found that the vibrational and rotational temperatures of NO are much higher than that of the N2 and O2 in the gas, in accordance with the BSUV2 measurements. The amount of NO produced in the flow fields at 87.5 km and above is found to be strongly dependent on the free-stream density of atomic oxygen.},

 abstract = {A new chemistry model is developed for the direct simulation Monte Carlo method (DSMC). This model explicitly includes separate biasing of the reaction cross section to the translational, rotational, and vibrational energies of each collision. The multiple parameter model is calibrated using detailed information on the formation of nitric oxide based on quasi-classical trajectory calculations. The trajectory analysis provides reaction cross sections, and the energy distributions of reactants and products. In the DSMC approach, product energies are assigned by the widely used Borgnakke–Larsen approach. The performance of the new DSMC model is evaluated in terms of reaction cross sections, energy distributions of reacting molecules, energy distributions of nitric oxide molecules formed in the reaction, and overall reaction rate coefficient. In all cases, the new chemistry model gives favorable agreement with the trajectory calculations. The excellent agreement obtained for product energy distributions indicates that the simple Borgnakke–Larsen energy partitioning scheme is a valid approach for this reaction. The new Monte Carlo chemistry model is applied to a hypersonic, low-density, reacting flow of air. By comparison with a previous chemistry model, the new model predicts significantly higher concentrations of nitric oxide. It is also found that nitric oxide molecules are formed in highly nonequilibrium states. Both of these findings are supported by experimental observations.},

 abstract = {There have been many studies of turbulent combustion flows, however the interaction between turbulent motion and the chemical reactions that occur in hypersonic flows has not been studied. In these flows, the rate of product formation depends almost exclusively on the temperature, and small temperature fluctuations may produce large changes in the rate of product formation. To study this process, we perform direct numerical simulations of reacting isotropic turbulence decay under conditions typical of a hypersonic turbulent boundary layer flow. We find that there is a positive feedback between the turbulence and exothermic reactions. That is, positive temperature fluctuations increase the reaction rate, thereby increasing the heat released by the reaction, which further increases the temperature. Simultaneously, the pressure increases causing localized expansions and compressions that feed the turbulent kinetic energy. The Reynolds stress budget shows that the feedback occurs through the pressure-strain term. We also find that the strength of the feedback depends on how much heat is released, the rate at which it is released, and the turbulent Mach number. The feedback process is negative for endothermic reactions, and temperature fluctuations are damped.},

The effects of free-stream total enthalpy and chemical composition on transition location are studied to give a better understanding of recent experimental observations. Namely, there is an increase in transition Reynolds number with increasing free-stream total enthalpy, and this increase is greater for gases with lower dissociation energies. The results show that linear stability predicts the same trends that were observed in the experiments, but with N=10, it consistently overpredicts the transition Reynolds numbers by about a factor of 2. The results of numerical experiments are presented which show the effect of reaction endo- or exothermicity on disturbance amplification rates.},

 abstract = {We present a molecular-level investigation of nitrogen dissociation at high temperature. The computational technique, called direct molecular simulation (DMS), solely relies on an ab initio potential energy surface and both N2+N2 and N+N2 processes are simulated as they concurrently take place in an evolving nonequilibrium gas system. Quasiclassical trajectory calculations (QCT) reveal that dissociation rate coefficients calculated at thermal equilibrium, i.e., assuming Boltzmann energy distributions, are approximately equal (within less than 15%) for both N2+N2 and N+N2 collisions for the range of temperatures considered. The DMS (nonequilibrium) results indicate, however, that the presence of atomic nitrogen significantly affects the dissociation rate of molecular nitrogen, but indirectly. In fact, the presence of atomic nitrogen causes an important reduction of the vibrational relaxation time of N2, by almost one order of magnitude. This, in turn, speeds up the replenishment of high-v states that are otherwise significantly depleted if only N2+N2 collisions are considered. Because of the strong favoring of dissociation from high-v states, this results in dissociation rates that are 2–3 times higher when significant atomic nitrogen is present compared to systems composed of mainly diatomic nitrogen, such as during the initial onset of dissociation. Specifically, we find that exchange events occur frequently during N+N2 collisions and that such exchange collisions constitute an effective mechanism of scrambling the internal energy states, resulting in multiquantum jumps in vibrational energy levels that effectively promote energy transfers. The resulting vibrational relaxation time constant we calculate for N+N2 collisions is significantly lower than the widely used Millikan-White model. Significant discrepancies are found between predictions of the Park two-temperature model (using the Millikan-White vibrational relaxation model) and the DMS results for dissociating nitrogen systems involving both atomic and molecular nitrogen. Such direct comparisons also illustrate how the DMS method is able to reveal all relevant nonequilibrium physics without the need to compute large numbers of state-transition probabilities. In this manner, DMS presents an accurate and tractable approach to construct models for direct-simulation Monte Carlo and computational fluid dynamics simulations from first principles.},

 abstract = {A major issue in achieving direct launch to space using electromagnetic railguns from the surface of the earth is that we are at the bottom of a gravity well, requiring very high launch velocities to achieve orbit insertion. The atmosphere is most dense at the earth's surface—this, combined with high velocity, leads to very stressing thermal conditions for the launch aerobody. To minimize aerodynamic losses, a typical hypersonic flight body is a blunt slender cone. The thermal loads are greatest on the nosetip of this cone, and for small bodies $(< {\hbox {10}}~{\hbox {kg}})$ the thermal loads may exceed the capabilities of present passive thermal protection systems, such as dense, ablative carbon phenolics. Even for launch from a high-altitude airborne platform, aerothermal loads can be considerable unless rocket assist is provided. This paper discusses aspects of the launch package and characteristics of the railgun needed to achieve orbit insertion velocities.},

In the present work, the evolution-variable manifold framework of Cymbalist and Dimotakis (“On Autoignition-Dominated Supersonic Combustion,” AIAA Paper 2015-2315, June 2015) is implemented in a computational fluid dynamics method, and Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and wall-modeled large-eddy simulations are performed for a hydrogen–air combustion test case. As implemented here, the evolution-variable manifold approach solves a scalar conservation equation for a reaction-evolution variable that represents both the induction and subsequent oxidation phases of combustion. The detailed thermochemical state of the reacting fluid is tabulated as a low-dimensional manifold as a function of density, energy, mixture fraction, and the evolution variable. A numerical flux function consistent with local thermodynamic processes is developed, and the approach for coupling the computational fluid dynamics to the evolution-variable manifold table is discussed. Wall-modeled large-eddy simulations incorporating the evolution-variable manifold framework are found to be in good agreement with full chemical kinetics model simulations and the jet in supersonic crossflow hydrogen–air experiments of Gamba and Mungal (“Ignition, Flame Structure and Near-Wall Burning in Transverse Hydrogen Jets in Supersonic Crossflow,” Journal of Fluid Mechanics, Vol. 780, Oct. 2015, pp. 226–273).

Distributed roughness with point-to-point height variation on the computational grid and maximum heights of 0.5–4.0 μm is used with the intent to emulate smooth-body transition and excite the naturally occurring most unstable disturbance wavenumber. Cases at the low-Reynolds number condition use three grid sizes, and hence three different roughness patterns, and demonstrate that the exact flow solution is dependent on the particular roughness pattern. The same roughness pattern is interpolated onto each grid, which yields similar solutions, indicating grid convergence. A steady physical mechanism is introduced for the sharp increase in wall heat flux seen in both computations and experiment at the high-Reynolds number condition. Evolution of disturbance spanwise wavelength is computed, and is found to be more sensitive to Reynolds number than roughness, indicating that the disturbance wavelength is primarily the naturally occurring, flow-selected wavelength for these cases.},

 abstract = {The modeling of the oxidation and sublimation of carbon-based ablative thermal protection system materials remains an area of active research. In this paper, two gas–surface interaction models for carbon are studied at representative reentry conditions. One model is based on the widely used B′ approach with an equilibrium saturated state assumption for the surface composition, and the second uses a detailed finite-rate chemical kinetics model for the gas–surface reactions. Key modeling parameters are varied in the finite-rate model to assess its sensitivity to modeling uncertainties. The gas-phase chemical kinetics models are also varied to characterize their effects on the ablation process. The models were evaluated using a generic sphere–cone geometry at four representative reentry conditions. It is found that there are notable differences in the predicted overall surface mass flux, and particularly in the details of the individual species mass fluxes to and from the surface. In addition, the gas-phase kinetic model is found to have important effects on the surface kinetics and the flux of individual species at the surface. From this study, it is clear that more detailed measurements of surface gas evolution under tightly controlled conditions are required to validate and improve the mechanism-based gas–surface interaction model for carbon. The B′ approach does not capture the interaction of the nonequilibrium state of the gas interacting with the surface, making that approach highly suspect for many of the conditions studied.},

 abstract = {An oxidation model for carbon surfaces has been developed where the gas–surface reaction mechanisms and corresponding rate parameters are based solely on observations from recent molecular beam experiments. In the experiments, a high-energy molecular beam containing atomic and molecular oxygen (93% atoms and 7% molecules) was directed at a high-temperature carbon surface. The measurements revealed that carbon monoxide (CO) is the dominant reaction product and that its formation required a high surface coverage of oxygen atoms. As the temperature of the carbon sample was increased during the experiment, the surface coverage reduced and the production of CO was diminished. Most importantly, the measured time-of-flight distributions of surface reaction products indicated that CO and carbon dioxide (CO2) are predominately formed through thermal reaction mechanisms as opposed to direct abstraction mechanisms. These observations have enabled the formulation of a finite-rate oxidation model that includes surface-coverage dependence, similar to existing finite-rate models used in computational fluid dynamics simulations. However, each reaction mechanism and all rate parameters of the new model are determined individually based on the molecular beam data. The new model is compared to existing models using both zero-dimensional gas–surface simulations and computational fluid dynamics simulations of hypersonic flow over an ablating surface. The new model predicts similar overall mass loss rates compared to existing models; however, the individual species production rates are completely different. The most notable difference is that the new model (based on molecular beam data) predicts CO as the oxidation reaction product with virtually no CO2 production, whereas existing models predict the exact opposite trend.},

Finite‐difference methods are applied to this problem (model), resulting in a second‐order nonlinear partial differential equation that has some features in common with the governing equations of fluid dynamics; the idea is also introduced of ‘upwind’ or solution‐dependent differencing methods, and the stability of these is discussed through the analysis of model problems. An implicit solution to the nonlinear dynamic programming problem is then developed and tested, with the motivation of reducing the computer time required to solve it.

A method to compute the transfer function using direct numerical simulation is proposed and found to have an uncertainty within 3%. Resonance due to an acoustic disturbance reflecting between the shock and pitot probe face is observed and exhibits increased amplification due to the focusing effect of shock curvature. Pitot probe geometry has the largest impact on resonant frequency, and the effect of mean freestream condition is also quantified. The transfer functions for different freestream disturbance types are found to differ by a constant factor, which is predicted by the analytic form of the transfer function in the low-frequency limit. Finally, using only the stagnation temperature and shock standoff distance, a normalization is found that collapses the results for all cases into a single curve.},

 abstract = {With the proper combination of high-order, low-dissipation numerical methods, physics-based subgrid-scale models, and boundary conditions it is becoming possible to simulate many combustion flows at relevant conditions. However, non-premixed flows are a particular challenge because the thickness of the fuel/oxidizer interface scales inversely with Reynolds number. Sharp interfaces can also be present in the initial or boundary conditions. When higher-order numerical methods are used, there are often aphysical undershoots and overshoots in the scalar variables (e.g. passive scalars, species mass fractions or progress variable). These numerical issues are especially prominent when low-dissipation methods are used, since sharp jumps in flow variables are not always coincident with regions of strong variation in the scalar fields: consequently, special detection mechanisms and dissipative fluxes are needed. Most numerical methods diffuse the interface, resulting in artificial mixing and spurious reactions. In this paper, we propose a numerical method that mitigates this issue. We present methods for passive and active scalars, and demonstrate their effectiveness with several examples.},

 abstract = {A computational study of the experiments performed by Lowry et al. at the Arnold Engineering and Development Center (AEDC) has been performed. In these experiments, a RF discharge is used to weakly ionize a volume of air; then a projectile is fired through this plasma. Relative to the conditions without the discharge, the shock standoff distance is observed to increase substantially, and the bow shock becomes flatter. The RF discharge and the resulting thermo-chemical state of the air within the discharge region have been modeled. Based on these conditions, the projectile flow field was simulated to determine if the relaxation of the stored internal energy causes the shock movement. The results obtained indicate that the stored internal energy does not relax fast enough and therefore this effect is not responsible for the observed effects. Two additional mechanisms are considered, and it is found that unsteady flight through thermal non-uniformities is the likely explanation.},

In collaboration with CUBRC Inc. personnel, we designed the experimental conditions for the double-cone geometry used in previous low-enthalpy nitrogen tests. We then used our standard CFD codes and thermo-chemical models to analyze these flows. In general, the comparisons with nitrogen flows are good, even at high enthalpy (10MJ/kg). But the comparisons between predictions and experiments for air above 5MJ/kg is poor. We find that as the enthalpy increases, the agreement gets worse. In particular, the CFD predicts that the separation zone decreases in size much more rapidly than given in the experiments.},

 abstract = {Achievement of the future US Air Force mission requires development of new high speed air vehicles. The aerodynamic performance of high speed air vehicles is sensitive to local flow phenomena which may adversely affect vehicle operation and possibly result in vehicle loss. An example is the Edney W shock-shock interaction which causes intense local surface heat transfer. New concepts in local flow control for high speed flows are needed to alleviate or eliminate adverse local flow phenomena. * Recently, a promising new research field in local flow control for high speed flows has emerged - Electromagnetic Local Flow Control (ELFC). Examples include beamed energy addition (e.g, laser and/or microwave energy deposition) and DC discharge, with or without external magnetic fields. Recent conferences and workshops have emphasized the importance of ELFC and identified many promising opportunities. This report describes the research accomplishments of Rutgers - The State University of New Jersey, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the University of Minnesota in understanding the fundamental physics and practical applications of Electromagnetic Local Flow Control in high speed flows.},

 abstract = {There are two main components of the work performed during this project. First, a finite-rate vibrational energy relaxation model was developed to study how the possible presence of water vapor in the Tunnel 9 facility could affect the flow properties. We find that water vapor levels at about 500 parts per million (ppm) could cause appreciable relaxation of the nitrogen test gas, however, even at these large levels, the effect on the flow quality is minimal. Secondly, a novel grid generation scheme for hypersonic nozzle flows is presented. The grid is based on the characteristic lines of the supersonic regions of the flow. This allows for grid alignment and clustering along shock waves present in the flow. Results from simulations run on the AEDC Hypervelocity Tunnel 9 Mach 14 nozzle give good agreement with simulations performed using a conventional grid. Some results from an investigation into the effect of wall contour discontinuities present in the Mach 14 Nozzle are presented.

The authors selected several test cases from the database of available wind tunnel tests where measurements of the position of transition on the leeward side of the body were obtained. A grid of the three-dimensional forebody shape of the vehicle was generated, mean flow analysis completed for all test cases and the solution symmetry plane was extracted for each case to compute a planar and oblique modal disturbance analysis.

Strategies for parallel partitioning, interprocessor communication, complex microstructure geometry representation, cutcell procedures, and parallel file input/output are presented and tested. Algorithms and data structures are developed for a microstructure generation tool called FiberGen that enables realistic microstructures to be constructed based on targeted fiber radius, orientation, and overall porosity, with user defined variations about these values. The data structures and algorithms associated with FiberGen are robust and efficient enough to enable DSMC simulations where the microstructure geometry changes to directly simulate ablation problems. Subsonic boundary conditions are described and validated, and a number of example solutions are presented. The example problems demonstrate the difference between surface ablation and in-depth volume ablation regimes for porous TPS materials.},

 abstract = {Numerical simulations are presented of a series of controlled repetitively pulsed experiments conducted at Stanford University. Recent analysis of the Stanford chemical kinetics and electrical discharge models shows that a repetitively pulsed electron heating strategy could provide a power budget reduction of over two orders of magnitude. The basis of this strategy is to leverage the finite recombination time of electrons and to increase the ionization efficiency by using voltage pulses of duration much shorter than the recombination time. We simulate the plasma by solving the Navier-Stokes equations that have been extended to account for the effect of finite rate chemical reactions, thermal non-equilibrium, and internal and collisional energy relaxation. The Stanford University two-temperature chemical kinetics model is used to describe the chemistry in the plasma. The reaction rates take into account electron temperatures when electrons are involved. The discharge region is modeled using the channel model suggested by Steenbeck. Preliminary results show very good agreement with electron density estimations from the measured electrical resistance of the plasma. For a pulsing frequency of 100 kHz, a pulse duration of 10 ns and a maximum pulse voltage of 10 kV the computations show that the electron number density increases from an initial value of 8.8 10/sup 11/ cm/sup −3/ a peak of 10/sup 13/ cm/sup −3/, then decays by an order of magnitude in about 10 /spl mu/s. The image shows the decay of electron number density as a function of time. The simulations are used to analyze the experimental results and further aid in scale-up.},

The trajectory points selected span the low supersonic to transonic regimes with freestream Mach numbers from 1.5 to 0.8, and freestream Reynolds numbers (based on diameter) between $2.09 \times 10^{6}$ and $2.93 \times 10^{6}$. Additionally, the Mach 0.8 case was simulated at angles of attack between 0° and 5°. Static aerodynamic coefficients obtained from the data show qualitative agreement with data from 70° sphere-cone wind tunnel tests performed for the Viking program. Finally, the effect of choices of models and numerical algorithms is addressed by comparing the DES results to those using a Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model, as well as to results using a more dissipative numerical scheme.},

The species diffusion fluxes are calculated using the Self-Consistent Effective Binary Diffusion approximation. The electric and magnetic potential equations are coupled to obtain electric and magnetic fields with a well-defined current density, based on the species diffusion flux formulation. The governing equations are solved using the Finite Volume Method (FVM). The Gauss-Seidel Line Relaxation (GSLR) method is used to find out solutions of the linearized equations, using successive sweeps in two different directions in a three-dimensional domain. The model is applied to a high-intensity argon arc with the plasma flow along the arc axis directed towards the anode surface. An additional cold cross flow is imposed with varying velocities parallel to the anode surface and perpendicular to the plasma flow.

 abstract = {In 2010 the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Mission will deliver the most massive and scientifically capable rover to the surface of Mars. To deliver this payload, an aerodynamic decelerator is required to decelerate the entry vehicle from supersonic to subsonic speeds, in advance of propulsive descent and touchdown on Mars. The aerodynamic deceleration will be accomplished by a mortar-deployed 21.5-m Viking-type disk-gap-band parachute (DGB), and will be the largest extra-terrestrial decelerator in the history of space exploration [1]. The parachute will deploy at up to Mach 2.2 and 750 Pa, resulting in the highest load and speed experienced by a parachute on Mars. The MSL parachute extends the envelope of the existing heritage deployment space in terms of load, size and Mach number. This has created the challenge of leveraging the existing heritage supersonic-high-altitude database, implementing a ground-based qualification program, and quantifying known aerodynamic instabilities associated with supersonic operation in the Mach regime of the MSL deployment. To address these challenges MSL has embarked upon a physics-based modeling and validation program to explore the fundamental physics associated with DGB-parachute operation in supersonic flow. The functional dependence of parachute performance and stability on Mach number, Reynolds number, parachute size, entry-vehicle size and parachute to entry vehicle proximity, is under investigation. The quantitative understanding garnered from this analytical effort will be used to leverage the existing heritage database of the Viking Lander, Viking Balloon Launched Decelerator Test (BLDT), Mars Pathfinder (MPF) and Mars Exploration Rover (MER) programs for the larger scale, deployment conditions, and modem construction techniques of the MSL parachute system. The physics-based modeling and validation effort includes the development of a coupled fluid and structural solver, i.e. fluid-structure-interaction code, and supersonic wind-tunnel experiments with subscale representations of the flight configuration.**1-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00 ©2008 IEEE. ††IEEEAC paper #1435, Version 3, Updated December 20,2007 ‡‡All authors contributed equally to this work. 1-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00 ©2008 IEEE.

 abstract = {There is considerable interest in finding methods to efficiently generate large volumes of atmospheric pressure air plasmas at temperatures below 2000 K with electron number densities of the order of 10/sup 13/ cm/sup −3/. Such plasmas can be produced by electrical discharges in which energy is applied to the free-electrons in a targeted fashion. Under appropriate conditions, the energized electrons can increase ionization through collisions without significantly heating the gas. This approach was successfully demonstrated in DC discharge experiments with low temperature atmospheric pressure air. Stable diffuse glow discharges were produced with electron number densities in excess of 10/sup 12/ cm, more than six orders of magnitude higher than in thermally heated 2000 K air. The measured discharge characteristics compare well with the predictions of a two-temperature kinetic model. The experimental and modeling results provide insight into the mechanisms of ionization of two-temperature air plasmas and show that the steady-state electron number density exhibits an S-shaped dependence on the electron temperature, a behavior resulting from competition between ionization and charge transfer reactions. DC discharges are not always practical because of their large power requirements. We recently showed that the power budget can be reduced by several orders of magnitude using short repetitive high-voltage pulses. Because inelastic energy losses, per electron created, are orders of magnitude smaller at Te=3-5 eV than at 1 eV, short pulses producing electron temperatures of 3-5 eV have much higher ionization efficiencies than typical 1 eV DC discharges. Between consecutive pulses, the plasma is sustained owing to the finite rate of electron recombination. A repetitively-pulsed discharge scheme was devised using these ideas and experiments are in progress in our laboratory with a 100 kHz, 12 kV, 10 ns pulse generator. Experimental and modeling results of these repetitively pulsed discharges will be presented.},

 abstract = {A three‐dimensional MHD solver is described in the paper. The solver simulates reacting flows with nonequilibrium between translational‐rotational, vibrational and electron translational modes. The conservation equations are discretized with implicit time marching and the second‐order modified Steger‐Warming scheme, and the resulted linear system is solved iteratively with Newton‐Krylov‐Schwarz method that is implemented by PETSc package. The results of convergence tests are plotted, which show good scalability and convergence around twice faster when compared with the DPLR method. Then five test runs are conducted simulating the experiments done at the NASA Ames MHD channel, and the calculated pressures, temperatures, electrical conductivity, back EMF, load factors and flow accelerations are shown to agree with the experimental data. Our computation shows that the electrical conductivity distribution is not uniform in the powered section of the MHD channel, and that it is important to include Joule heating in order to calculate the correct conductivity and the MHD acceleration.},

@article{pub.1100673609,
 abstract = {We investigate flow instability created by an oblique shock wave impinging on a Mach 5.92 laminar boundary layer at a transitional Reynolds number. The adverse pressure gradient of the oblique shock causes the boundary layer to separate from the wall, resulting in the formation of a recirculation bubble. For sufficiently large oblique shock angles, the recirculation bubble is unstable to three-dimensional perturbations and the flow bifurcates from its original laminar state. We utilize direct numerical simulation (DNS) and global stability analysis to show that this first occurs at a critical shock angle of θ=12.9∘. At bifurcation, the least-stable global mode is nonoscillatory and it takes place at a spanwise wave number β=0.25, in good agreement with DNS results. Examination of the critical global mode reveals that it originates from an interaction between small spanwise corrugations at the base of the incident shock, streamwise vortices inside the recirculation bubble, and spanwise modulation of the bubble strength. The global mode drives the formation of long streamwise streaks downstream of the bubble. While the streaks may be amplified by either the lift-up effect or by Görtler instability, we show that centrifugal instability plays no role in the upstream self-sustaining mechanism of the global mode. We employ an adjoint solver to corroborate our physical interpretation by showing that the critical global mode is most sensitive to base flow modifications that are entirely contained inside the recirculation bubble.},

 abstract = {Micro scale simulations are performed of flow through porous (pyrolyzing) thermal protection system (TPS) materials using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. DSMC results for permeability are validated with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations and theory, for simple porous geometries under continuum flow conditions. An artificial fiber-microstructure generation code FiberGen is used to create triangulated surface geometry representative of FiberForm® (FiberForm) material. DSMC results for permeability of FiberForm are validated for a range of pressures (transitional flow conditions) and agree with experimental measurements. Numerical uncertainty is determined to be within 2% if sufficiently large portions of the microstructure are included in the computation. However, small variations in fiber size and angle bias can combine to give + 30 % uncertainty when comparing with experimental permeability data. X-ray microtomography scans of FiberForm are used to create microstructure geometry for incorporation within DSMC simulations of coupled oxygen diffusion and gas-surface chemistry in the presence of a blowing pyrolysis gas. In-depth penetration of atomic oxygen is limited to 0.2 – 0.4 mm for the range of Knudsen number and pyrolysis gas conditions studied.},

@article{pub.1103877411,
 abstract = {Many turbulent flows are characterized by complex scale interactions and vorticity generation caused by compressibility and variable-density effects. In the large-eddy simulation of variable-density flows, these processes manifest themselves as subgrid-scale (SGS) terms that interact with the resolved-scale flow. This paper studies the effect of the variable-density SGS terms and quantifies their relative importance. We consider the SGS terms appearing in the density-weighted Favre-filtered equations and in the unweighted Reynolds-filtered equations. The conventional form of the Reynolds-filtered momentum equation is complicated by a temporal SGS term; therefore, we derive a new form of the Reynolds-filtered governing equations that does not contain this term and has only double-correlation SGS terms. The new form of the filtered equations has terms that represent the SGS mass flux, pressure-gradient acceleration and velocity-dilatation correlation. To evaluate the dynamical significance of the variable-density SGS effects, we carry out direct numerical simulations of compressible decaying turbulence at a turbulent Mach number of 0.3. Two different initial thermodynamic conditions are investigated: homentropic and a thermally inhomogeneous gas with regions of differing densities. The simulated flow fields are explicitly filtered to evaluate the SGS terms. The importance of the variable-density SGS terms is quantified relative to the SGS specific stress, which is the only SGS term active in incompressible constant-density turbulence. It is found that while the variable-density SGS terms in the homentropic case are negligible, they are dynamically significant in the thermally inhomogeneous flows. Investigation of the variable-density SGS terms is therefore important, not only to develop variable-density closures but also to improve the understanding of scale interactions in variable-density flows.},

 abstract = {We investigate the onset of three-dimensionality in a Mach 5 slender-double-wedge flow as the turn angle at the compression corner increases. Beyond a critical angle, the two-dimensional flow destabilizes to three-dimensional perturbations and results in growth of spanwise periodic flow structures. We carry out global linear stability analysis to identify the critical turn angle and the nature of the associated three-dimensional instability. At the critical angle, an unstable mode is present in the separation bubble and the reattached boundary layer. The mode is associated with streamwise streaks in wall temperature downstream of the corner. The existence of the unstable mode and its growth rate are confirmed with direct numerical simulations. It is found from budget analysis that streamwise deceleration of the recirculating flow plays a dominant role in the three-dimensional instability. Wave-maker analysis suggests that the instability does not have a centrifugal origin. Linear stability analysis of the steady-state flow at an angle beyond bifurcation is also carried out. The spanwise wavelength of the most unstable mode obtained at this turn angle compares well with experimental observations.},

 abstract = {Hypersonic flows are energetic and result in regions of high temperature, causing internal energy excitation, chemical reactions, ionization, and gas-surface interactions. At typical flight conditions, the rates of these processes are often similar to the rate of fluid motion. Thus, the gas state is out of local thermodynamic equilibrium and must be described by conservation equations for the internal energy and chemical state. Examples illustrate how competition between rates in hypersonic flows can affect aerodynamic performance, convective heating, boundary layer transition, and ablation. The conservation equations are outlined, and the most widely used models for internal energy relaxation, reaction rates, and transport properties are reviewed. Gas-surface boundary conditions are described, including finite-rate catalysis and slip effects. Recent progress in the use of first-principles calculations to understand and quantify critical gas-phase reactions is discussed. An advanced finite-rate carbon ablation model is introduced and is used to illustrate the role of rate processes at hypersonic conditions.},

The nitrogen dissociation rate with all collision partners is found to be similar for a given thermal environment: the largest deviation is 50% at thermal nonequilibrium, and at equilibrium the N2+N2 and N2+N rates are within 15% of each other. The vibrational energy decrease due to nitrogen dissociation, a necessary input to computational fluid dynamics, also behaves similarly for all collision partners and strongly depends on the degree of thermal nonequilibrium. Using data for nitrogen dissociation and oxygen dissociation with partner N2, the effect of each reactant state on dissociation is quantified. The effect of the collision partner’s internal energy on simple dissociation is found to be small and likely negligible. Finally, the effect of vibrational energy on simple dissociation is found to be stronger than the effect of rotational energy. These rigorous statistical analyses enable the development of physics-based models for computational fluid dynamics.},

 abstract = {While low disturbance ("quiet") hypersonic wind tunnels are believed to provide more reliable extrapolation of boundary layer transition behavior from ground to flight, the presently available quiet facilities are limited to Mach 6, moderate Reynolds numbers, low freestream enthalpy, and subscale models. As a result, only conventional ("noisy") wind tunnels can reproduce both Reynolds numbers and enthalpies of hypersonic flight configurations, and must therefore be used for flight vehicle test and evaluation involving high Mach number, high enthalpy, and larger models. This article outlines the recent progress and achievements in the characterization of tunnel noise that have resulted from the coordinated effort within the AVT-240 specialists group on hypersonic boundary layer transition prediction. New Direct Numerical Simulation datasets elucidate the physics of noise generation inside the turbulent nozzle wall boundary layer, characterize the spatiotemporal structure of the freestream noise, and account for the propagation and transfer of the freestream disturbances to a pitot-mounted sensor. The new experimental measurements cover a range of conventional wind tunnels with different sizes and Mach numbers from 6 to 14 and extend the database of freestream fluctuations within the spectral range of boundary layer instability waves over commonly tested models. Prospects for applying the computational and measurement datasets for developing mechanism-based transition prediction models are discussed.},

                    We study and compare instability mechanisms of a Mach 5.65 laminar boundary layer tripped by an isolated diamond-shaped trip and by an array of diamond-shaped trips using direct numerical simulations. A low-Reynolds-number experiment, consisting of the trip array (Semper & Bowersox,
                    AIAA J.
                    , vol. 55 (3), 2017, pp. 808–817), is used to validate our simulations. Three dynamically prominent flow structures are observed in both trip configurations. These flow structures are the upstream vortex system, the shock system, and the downstream shear layers/counter-rotating streamwise vortices that originate from the top and sides of the trips. Analysis of the power spectral density of pressure reveals the source of instability to be an interaction between the shear layers and the counter-rotating streamwise vortices downstream of both trip configurations. The interaction leads to the formation of hairpin-like structures that eventually break down to turbulent flow. This finding contrasts with that of an isolated cylindrical trip (Subbareddy

 abstract = {We investigate flow instability created by an oblique shock wave impinging on
a Mach 5.92 laminar boundary layer at a transitional Reynolds number. The
adverse pressure gradient of the oblique shock causes the boundary layer to
separate from the wall, resulting in the formation of a recirculation bubble.
For sufficiently large oblique shock angles, the recirculation bubble is
unstable to three-dimensional perturbations and the flow bifurcates from its
original laminar state. We utilize Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Global
Stability Analysis (GSA) to show that this first occurs at a critical shock
angle of $\theta = 12.9^o$. At bifurcation, the least stable global mode is
non-oscillatory, and it takes place at a spanwise wavenumber $\beta=0.25$, in
good agreement with DNS results. Examination of the critical global mode
reveals that it originates from an interaction between small spanwise
corrugations at the base of the incident shock, streamwise vortices inside the
recirculation bubble, and spanwise modulation of the bubble strength. The
global mode drives the formation of long streamwise streaks downstream of the
bubble. While the streaks may be amplified by either the lift-up effect or by
Görtler instability, we show that centrifugal instability plays no role in
the upstream self-sustaining mechanism of the global mode. We employ an adjoint
solver to corroborate our physical interpretation by showing that the critical
global mode is most sensitive to base flow modifications that are entirely
contained inside the recirculation bubble.},

Including the components of the optical system that forms the image in the simulation is found to be important. The technique produces images that replicate flow physics more faithfully than straight-line path integration and other techniques, and more efficiently than physical-optics techniques. Applications of these simulated images are demonstrated in supersonic flows. Time-correlated pairs of shadowgraph images taken from the LES using this technique are used in conjunction with an image-correlation velocimetry technique to compare the estimated convection velocity field in the LES to that of experiments of the same flow. Agreement between the two is good with a maximum variance of 5% by some metrics. This technique can aid in the validation of LES results, allowing quantitative comparison between experiment and simulation, and to extract information unattainable by experiment alone. Comparisons of simulated and experimental jet penetration into the supersonic freestream are also made.Graphic abstract},

 abstract = {The development of disturbances in the boundary-layer transition (BoLT) flight experiment flowfield is investigated using a recently developed “quiet direct numerical simulation (DNS)” approach. By using a combination of low-dissipation numerics and a novel shock capturing method, numerical noise is significantly reduced, enabling the simulation and analysis of early stages of the transition process that are governed by the linear growth of small-amplitude disturbances. The freestream conditions of the present simulations correspond to experiments conducted in the Purdue Boeing/U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research Mach 6 quiet tunnel under quiet flow at a unit Reynolds number of 9.88×106 m−1. First, the steady-state flowfield is computed and then compared to infrared images, demonstrating excellent agreement with experimentally measured steady streamwise wall heat flux streaks. Next, an unsteady numerical simulation is performed with continuous stochastic forcing to excite boundary-layer instabilities. Two-dimensional time-series snapshots of the disturbance flowfield are saved at several streamwise locations. Sparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition (SPDMD) is used to extract dominant modes from the snapshot sequences. The frequencies of dominant modes are compared to power spectral densities obtained from wall pressure fluctuations measured in the experiments. Based on numerical and experimental data, three distinct instabilities in the BoLT flowfield are identified. The quiet DNS approach used in conjunction with controlled disturbances to excite instabilities, as well as SPDMD to analyze them, represents a new high-fidelity method of investigating stability and transition in complex three-dimensional flowfields.},

A primary goal is to assess the inflow conditions, numerical methods, and physical models requirement to reproduce experimental results on molecular mixing and effects of inflow conditions in high-Reynolds number mixing layers: here, we target experiments performed by Slessor et al. (J. Fluid Mech. 376, 115–138 1998). The streams forming the mixing layer carry small amounts of hydrogen and fluorine, initiating a hypergolic reaction upon mixing at large Damköhler number. In this regime, product formation and temperature rise in the flow is mixing limited. The chemical compositions considered for this study correspond to low levels of heat release and results in adiabatic flame temperature rise of 171K and 267K. Both reacting and non-reacting simulations are performed with the Vreman sub-grid scale model (Vreman Phys. Fluids 16(10), 3670–3681 2004). A grid resolution study is done and comparisons are made with the available experimental data. To mitigate dispersive errors and ensure boundedness in species mass fractions that occur in simulations of non-premixed combustion, non-linear scaling limiters are used for reconstructing species densities during flux evaluation. The simulations show good agreement of the velocity and temperature rise profiles with experiment, and reveal differences in the flow field attributed to changes in the inflow conditions.},

The variable hard sphere (VHS) cross section model is used in MGDS and the consistent expressions for viscosity and thermal conductivity are used in US3D. For the lowest Knudsen number case (0.001) we observe excellent agreement between US3D and MGDS for both 1-D test cases. As the Knudsen number is increased in MGDS, the behavior gradually departs from the continuum solution. In order to investigate a more relevant 2-dimensional flow field with strong diffusive transport, we compare a shear flow generated by two parallel supersonic jets with different velocities using US3D and MGDS. Although this flow field has a discontinuity at the inflow that creates two oblique shocks, having the entire flow field remain supersonic allows for more consistent treatment of boundary conditions between DSMC and CFD. Comparisons are made at several locations, where the disagreement between peak values of heat flux and shear stress decreases as the distance from the inflow increases. Although the agreement is reasonable between US3D and MGDS, the differences motivate a more consistent comparison involving one-way coupling from CFD to DSMC as future work.},

Because input-output analysis does not invoke simplifying assumptions about the spatial growth of the boundary layer, it seamlessly captures the effects of non-modal growth which the linear and parabolized stability theory do not, in particular, it captures the effects of spatial transient growth. Because global analysis requires the solution to large, sparse linear systems which are non-normal and poorly conditioned, a survey of Krylov subspace methods is performed, and the usefulness of the GMRES and TFQMR algorithms are also investigated in more detail. For application to 3D flows, a segmented mesh method is then proposed for input-output analysis, and preliminary input-output results are shown for a cone with a highly swept fin at Mach 6.},

 abstract = {We study physical mechanisms that trigger transient growth in a high-speed spatially developing laminar boundary layer that interacts with an oblique shock wave. We utilize an approach based on power iteration, with the global forward and adjoint linearized equations, to quantify the transient growth in compressible boundary layers with flow separation. For a Mach 5.92 boundary layer with no oblique shock wave, we show that the dominant transient response consists of oblique waves, which arise from the inviscid Orr mechanism, the lift-up effect, and the first-mode instability. We also demonstrate that the presence of the oblique shock wave significantly increases transient growth over short time intervals through a mechanism that is not related to a slowly growing global instability. The resulting response takes the form of spanwise periodic streamwise elongated streaks, and our analysis of the linearized inviscid transport equations shows that base-flow deceleration near the reattachment location contributes to their amplification. The large transient growth of streamwise streaks demonstrates the importance of nonmodal effects in the amplification of flow perturbations and identifies a route for the emergence of similar spatial structures in transitional hypersonic flows with shock-wave/boundary-layer interactions.},

Using the spatial structure of the dominant response to time-periodic inputs, we explain the origin of steady reattachment streaks. Our analysis of the laminar shock/boundary layer interaction reveals that the streaks arise from a preferential amplification of upstream counter-rotating vortical perturbations with a specific span-wise wavelength. These streaks are associated with heat flux striations at the wall near flow reattachment and they can trigger transition to turbulence. The streak wavelength predicted by our analysis compares favorably with observations from two different hypersonic compression ramp experiments. Furthermore, we utilize the dominant response to analyze the physical effects in the linearized dynamical system responsible for amplification of disturbances. We show that flow compressibility that arises from base flow deceleration contributes to the amplification of streamwise velocity and that the baroclinic effects are responsible for the production of streamwise vorticity. Both these effects contribute to the appearance of temperature streaks observed in experiments and are critically important for the development of control-oriented models for transition to turbulence in hypersonic flows.},

 abstract = {Hypersonic flow over a three-dimensional 30–55 deg double wedge is investigated for three different conditions of varying enthalpy and Reynolds number with nitrogen as the test gas. Streamwise and spanwise wall heat flux are compared to the experimental data that were obtained at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and the California Institute of Technology. In previous studies, there were concerns that portions of the flowfield were rarefied; however, after an in-depth analysis, we find the flowfield to be firmly in the continuum regime. Comparisons of heat flux at an instant of time in the simulations show good agreement with the experiments. However, averaged heat flux over a long period of time relative to the experimental test time are underpredicted and develop low-frequency periodic motion. To better understand the unsteadiness and three-dimensionality of the flowfield, we analyze the mass flux through a spanwise plane, and we perform sparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition for the wall heat flux and midplane pressure. Finally, we analyze the effect of vibrational nonequilibrium on the flowfield. It is found that the flowfield dynamics vary with increasing enthalpy and Reynolds number. Furthermore, the flowfield is found to be three dimensional, unsteady, and asymmetric for all cases.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes a probabilistic framework for assessing the consistency of an experimental dataset, i.e., whether the stated experimental conditions are consistent with the measurements provided. In case the dataset is inconsistent, our framework allows one to hypothesize and test sources of inconsistencies. This is crucial in model validation efforts. The framework relies on Bayesian inference to estimate experimental settings deemed uncertain, from measurements deemed accurate. The quality of the inferred variables is gauged by its ability to reproduce held-out experimental measurements. The correctness of the framework is tested on three double-cone experiments conducted in the Calspan-University at Buffalo Research Center’s Large Energy National Shock Tunnel-I (LENS-I), which have also been numerically simulated successfully. Thereafter, the framework is used to investigate two double-cone experiments (executed in the LENS-XX), which have encountered difficulties when used in model validation exercises. An inconsistency is detected with one of the LENS-XX experiments. In addition, two causes are hypothesized for our inability to simulate LEXS-XX experiments accurately and are tested using our framework. It is found that there is no single cause that explains all the discrepancies between model predictions and experimental data, but different causes explain different discrepancies, to larger or smaller extent. This paper proposes that uncertainty quantification methods be used more widely to understand experiments and characterize facilities, and three different methods are cited to do so, the third of which is presented in this paper.},

This paper considers the numerical methods associated with simulating shock-turbulence interactions for a hypersonic sphere-cone. Atmospheric turbulence is first generally characterized, and then a turbulent shear simulation is characterized in relation to hypersonic flight in order to establish a method for simulating the interaction between hypersonic vehicles and atmospheric turbulence. Low-dissipation Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) methods for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations are compared with linear equations for planar wave and oblique shock interaction and found to accurately simulate the shock-disturbance interaction. Linear growth of boundary layer waves due to interaction with the second mode instability in hypersonic boundary layer is also simulated with low dissipation DNS and found to compare well with predictions from the Parabolized Stability Equations (PSE). Lastly, atmospheric turbulence in relation to hypersonic flight and simulation requirements to determine it's effect on hypersonic boundary layer transition are discussed.},

This restriction motivated the development of wall models which approximate the near wall behavior using a simplified set of equations, allowing for larger near wall cells and larger time-steps. In this work, we apply wall modeled LES (WMLES) to three turbulent boundary layer test cases to assess the performance of WMLES under cold-wall hypersonic conditions through comparison with direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. We compare velocity and temperature profiles as well as surface statistics including skin friction coefficient and wall heat transfer rate with DNS data. We find that the velocity profile is well captured using WMLES for adiabatic wall conditions, but is slightly under-predicted by WMLES in cases with wall cooling. All cases considered exhibit some error in the predicted temperature profile normal to the wall, particularly around the point where data is exchanged between the LES simulation and the wall model. The skin friction coefficient predicted at the wall is in good agreement with the DNS data, with less than 6% error across the range of conditions studied. We also investigate the effect of moving the wall exchange point for the wall model and find that selecting the first point off the wall yields significant errors as observed by previous researchers.},

Simulation results are compared between the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method that naturally captures slip effects and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using an appropriate slip model. Only the leading-edge portions of these flow configurations are studied. The simulations are verified to be converged in terms of grid and particle resolution. Overall, excellent agreement is found between DSMC and CFD predictions of the leading-edge boundary layer, the magnitude of velocity-slip and temperature-jump, and surface heat flux for all cases considered, with the exception of the double-cone case due to the relatively high Knudsen number of the flow. The largest discrepancies were found for the double-cone (transitional flow conditions), and near-exact agreement was found for the double-wedge (continuum flow conditions). It was determined that slip effects cannot account for the discrepancy between CFD predictions and experimentally measured heat flux for the hollow-cylinder flare. Furthermore, it was determined that the previously recommended threshold for the continuum breakdown parameter might be overly conservative in the near-wall region if appropriate slip models are used in CFD.},

 abstract = {This paper discusses the recent progress with a validation exercise to examine the effectiveness of DSMC and Navier‐Stokes in predicting complex flows involving shock/shock and shock/boundary layer interactions under laminar hypersonic conditions. The exercise is based on experiments conducted in the Aerothermal and Aero‐Optics Evaluation Center shock tunnels using nitrogen. Under moderately rarefied conditions Navier‐Stokes methods have performed very well in capturing the details of flow structure especially when non‐equilibrium and slip effects are accounted for, whereas DSMC has not been as successful. In particular, the size of the separation regions is underestimated. This paper presents redefined test conditions accounting for vibrational non‐equilibrium which have been substantiated by correlations obtained for pressure and heat transfer on the hollow cylinder and cone forebodies. Details are announced of two new lower density test conditions for future validation studies.},

 abstract = {A hybrid continuum/particle approach is proposed for micro scale gas flows in this paper. The approach couples the DSMC‐IP method and a Navier‐Stokes solver with an adaptive interface. The continuum solver uses the particle cells as ghost cells because the IP method preserves the hydrodynamic information that the continuum solver uses. In order to generate particles from the continuum side, two strategies are proposed. The first one uses a condition similar to the Marshak condition in generating particles through the interface. The second strategy adopts buffer cells and reservoir cells, which avoids directly generating particles. The interface is determined by a continuum breakdown parameter that is evaluated in every time step. In order to track the interface, a mapping technique is used in the code. Numerical examples show that the hybrid approach couples the continuum solver and the particle method very smoothly. Simulated results also show the effects of the cutoff value of the continuum breakdown parameter.},

 abstract = {Stardust reentry flows have been simulated at 80 km altitude, 12.8 km/s, using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Neutral and ionization processes among neutral air species, as well as five ionic species and electrons were considered in the DSMC flowfield modeling using the ion‐averaged velocity model to maintain charge‐neutrality. In CFD, two electron temperature models were compared, and it was found that the degree of ionization (DOI) is sensitive to the electron temperature model. At 80 km, the DOI predicted by DSMC was found to be approximately 3%, but in CFD, the DOI is greater than 20% for the case of Te = Ttr and 9% for the case of Te = Tvib. Therefore, compared to the DSMC solution, the assumption of Te = Tvib is preferable in CFD. Using the Mott‐Smith (M‐S) model, good agreement was obtained between the analytical bimodal distribution functions and DSMC velocity distributions. An effective temperature correction in the relaxation and chemical reaction models using the M‐S model was developed in CFD, and the model reduced the continuum breakdown discrepancy between DSMC and CFD inside the shock in terms of DOI and temperatures. With the M‐S model, the DOI for the case of Te = Tvib in CFD is decreased by approximately 3%.},

 abstract = {Understanding physical mechanisms that cause transition of laminar boundary layers to turbulent state in hypersonic flows is important for vehicle design and analysis. Mechanisms of linear perturbation growth in high speed boundary layers subjected to abrupt inviscid pressure jumps have been relatively less studied. Inviscid pressure jumps are associated with geometry effects and impinging shocks. They cause the boundary layer to separate, forming a separation-reattachment shock system. In the present study, we investigate small perturbation growth in a nominally two-dimensional interaction on a slender double wedge. We report and discuss intrinsic instabilities as well as amplification of external perturbations in the setup, both of which result in streamwise heat flux streaks near and post-reattachment.},

This allows us to investigate the later stages of the transition process governed by nonlinear evolution of the boundary layer state. Unsteady simulations using US3D are performed with broadband stochastic forcing to mimic quiet wind tunnel noise. Disturbances are introduced at an interpolated inflow plane located downstream of the leading edge to allow disturbances to grow which are induced by boundary layer instability mechanisms. Two-dimensional time series snapshots are collected at streamwise locations along the geometry to compute spatio-temporal information from extracted boundary layer modes. Modal analysis is performed with a streaming version of total dynamic mode decomposition (STDMD) with a compressible energy norm weighting to identify modes associated with distinct transition processes. Frequencies computed from STDMD modes show excellent agreement with power spectral density peaks measured from experiments and simulation.},

 abstract = {View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-0948.vid Experiments and computations have extensively studied hypersonic boundary layer transition over sharp and blunt cones. Transition on sharp and small bluntness cones is dominated by modal growth of planar waves. As bluntness increases, an entropy layer develops that stabilizes Mack modes and pushes the transition front downstream. Experiments show that beyond a critical nose bluntness, downstream movement of the transition front reverses and despite being modally stable the transition front moves up to the nose tip. Despite many experimental and numerical investigations, the transition reversal phenomenon has not been clearly linked to a physical mechanism. In this study, direct numerical simulation (DNS) and input-output (IO) are utilized to study the effects of nose bluntness on the amplification of external disturbances. DNS is performed on low dissipation baseflows that are forced stochastically with freestream noise and wall roughness. Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition is used on snapshots of the statistically steady state DNS solution to isolate globally dominant resolvent modes. An input-output framework is used to study the optimal flow response to forcing in the linear regime. Results from both the DNS and IO identify low frequency streak-like structures that grow significantly on the nose tip.These structures are shown to exist on both intermediate bluntness (1.524 mm radius) cones and large bluntness (15.24 mm radius) cones, but grow 2 orders of magnitude more in the large bluntness case. The structures are extremely receptive to roughness. The low frequency streak-like structures identified in this work behave in accordance with experimental observations of transition reversal, potentially providing a physical mechanism to explain the phenomenon.},

Such multiphysics effects can include the aerooelastic response of the airframe or engine components, dynamic transport of atmospheric particles, the deformation of solid-fluid interfaces that can ablate, pyrolyze, or erode, as well as a host of other processes, all of which are governed by unique sets of physical equations and models. Coupling multiple (and potentially disparate) physics solvers to a robust compressible flow solver poses additional challenges related to the stability, performance and scalability of the combined solver. The choices made during the software design process can therefore lead to a variation in simulation efficiency across different computer architectures. In this paper, we will consider two representative multiphysics hypersonic flow scenarios: the interaction of solid particulates with the flow field created by a hypersonic lifting body and the aerooelastic deformation of a model airframe under high-Mach-number flow conditions. For these simulations we explore the behavior of several hypersonic simulation tools, including Kestrel, FUN3D, US3D, and the JENRE(R) Multiphysics Framework, on several high performance computing systems containing various CPU and GPU architectures.},

This paper presents the development and initial testing of a calibration system for optical particle counters that measure aerosol particles in the stratosphere via high-altitude balloon platforms. The calibration system is currently capable of replicating a range of low-pressures corresponding to altitudes between 24 and 37 km, a range of aerosol velocities between 1 and 5 m/s, and generating aerosol particle sizes ranging from 0.5 to 5.0 micrometers. The initial testing consisted of applying the calibration system to evaluate the performance of a modified Alphasense OPC-N3 in the 20 to 3 Torr range (corresponding to altitudes of 24 to 37 km). It was found that detection efficiency appears to be highly dependent on the ambient pressure and there exists a critical pressure below which the OPC-N3 fails to measure the particle size distribution. The results also suggest that the low-pressure environment limits the detection efficiency for larger particles.},

Nose tip ablation has multi-physical effects on the flow field that can potentially stabilize or destabilize the boundary layer by modifying the geometry, introducing additional chemical species, and changing the wall temperature profile. The objective of this work is to investigate how nonspherical nose tip blunting affects boundary layer stability for the Reentry F flight vehicle. A portion of the Reentry F flight experiment trajectory is simulated using a coupled fluid-solid solver which includes conjugate heat transfer (CHT) and gas-surface interaction (GSI) models. The resulting base flows with GSI modeled are used to compute a species mass flux of carbon from the nose tip, which is then used to determine an approximate recession rate as the flight vehicle descended from 100,000 ft (30.48 km) to 80,000 ft (24.38 km). A total recession distance is then computed and new grids are constructed for base flow computation and stability analysis. A sensitivity study of the effect of recession on boundary layer stability is then completed for 1x, 1.5x, and 2x the nominal recession using the parabolized stability equations (PSE). It is observed that this non-spherical blunting has strong destabilizing effects upstream of approximately 1 m, while the downstream boundary layer stability is unaffected.},

They are reported to have the potential to evade ballistic missile early warning systems and to maneuver as they fly toward their target. A recent analysis by Tracy and Wright in Science & Global Security claimed to show that typical boost-glide vehicles produce significant infrared signatures that would be readily detectable with existing U.S. satellites and therefore questioned the potential advantages of hypersonic weapons over existing missiles. The prior analysis is revisited and several inconsistencies in the underlying assumptions are described. A detailed computational fluid dynamics analysis predicts typical infrared signatures to be significantly lower than those predicted by Tracy and Wright. As a result, these signatures would fall below the detection threshold of legacy U.S. Defense Support Program satellites but remain detectable by the more modern sensors from the Space-Based Infrared System. There are two significant issues with the prior analysis: an incorrect aerodynamic angle of attack was used, and the turbulent heat transfer rate correlation used to predict the surface temperature is inaccurate at the conditions studied.},

 abstract = {This study utilizes in-situ data of stratospheric particle size distributions to understand particle-surface impacts at hypersonic flight conditions. Particle diameters range from 0.2 to [Formula: see text]. Simulations are performed to track Lagrangian particles through the flowfield and statistically gather the characteristics of particles that impact the surface. Probability density functions in terms of surface-impact locations, particle sizes, velocities, incident angles, and kinetic energies are presented. The results indicate that sub-micrometer-diameter particles most frequently impact the nosetip of the vehicle at a range of velocities that tend toward the freestream velocity at higher altitudes. However, it does not appear that sub-micrometer particles significantly contribute to the net surface-impact kinetic energy. It is shown that larger particles between 6 and [Formula: see text] are responsible for the majority of net surface-impact kinetic energy, despite these surface-impact events being infrequent.},
