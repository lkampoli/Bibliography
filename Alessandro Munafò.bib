The physical model is based on a kinetic database developed at NASA Ames Research Center. The reduction of the kinetic mechanism is achieved by lumping the rovibrational energy levels of the N2 molecule in energy bins. The energy bins are treated as separate species, thus allowing for non-Boltzmann distributions of their populations. The governing equations are discretized in space by means of the Finite Volume method. A fully implicit time-integration is used to obtain steady-state solutions. The results show that the population of the energy bins strongly deviate from a Boltzmann distribution close to the shock wave and across the boundary layer. The sensitivity analysis to the number of energy bins reveals that accurate estimation of flow quantities (such as chemical composition and wall heat flux) can be obtained by using only 10 energy bins. A comparison with the predictions obtained by means of conventional multi-temperature models indicates that the former can lead to an overestimation of the wall heat flux, due to an inaccurate modeling of recombination in the boundary layer.},

The rate coefficients for rovibrational dissociation and excitation are provided by two chemical databases for the N + N2 system recently developed at NASA Ames Research Center and the University of Bari. Vibrationally averaged rate coefficients for N + N2 collisions are computed based on the hypothesis of equilibrium between translational and rotational modes. N2 + N2 collisions are also considered based on literature data. Inviscid and quasi 1D governing equations are discretized in space by means of a finite volume method. A fully implicit time integration method is applied to obtain steady state solutions. Results show that, for both N + N2 and N2 + N2 collision dominated flows, the populations of vibrational levels deviate from a Boltzmann distribution. An accurate investigation of vibrational level dynamics shows the different behavior of low and high-lying states. Comparison against experimental data acquired at the EAST facility of NASA Ames Research Center demonstrate good agreement between the computed and experimental results.},

 abstract = {In this paper a spectral-Lagrangian method is proposed for the full, non-linear Boltzmann equation for a multi-energy level gas typical of a hypersonic re-entry flow. Internal energy levels are treated as separate species and inelastic collisions (leading to internal energy excitation and relaxation) are accounted for. The formulation developed can also be used for the case of a gas mixture made of monatomic gases without internal energy (where only elastic collisions occur). The advantage of the spectral-Lagrangian method lies in the generality of the algorithm in use for the evaluation of the elastic and inelastic collision operators, as well as the conservation of mass, momentum and energy during collisions. The latter is realized through the solution of constrained optimization problems. The computational procedure is based on the Fourier transform of the partial elastic and inelastic collision operators and exploits the fact that these can be written as weighted convolutions in Fourier space with no restriction on the cross-section model. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical examples for both space homogeneous and in-homogeneous problems. Computational results are compared with those obtained by means of the DSMC method in order to assess the accuracy of the proposed spectral-Lagrangian method.},

 abstract = {This work addresses the modeling of dissociation and energy transfer processes in shock heated nitrogen flows by means of the maximum entropy linear model and a newly proposed hybrid bin vibrational collisional model. Both models aim at overcoming two of the main limitations of the state of the art non-equilibrium models: (i) the assumption of equilibrium between rotational and translational energy modes of the molecules and (ii) the reliance on the quasi-steady-state distribution for the description of the population of the internal levels. The formulation of the coarse-grained models is based on grouping the energy levels into bins, where the population is assumed to follow a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at its own temperature. Different grouping strategies are investigated. Following the maximum entropy principle, the governing equations are obtained by taking the zeroth and first-order moments of the rovibrational master equations. The accuracy of the proposed models is tested against the rovibrational master equation solution for both flow quantities and population distributions. Calculations performed for free-stream velocities ranging from 5 km/s to 10 km/s demonstrate that dissociation can be accurately predicted by using only 2-3 bins. It is also shown that a multi-temperature approach leads to an under-prediction of dissociation, due to the inability of the former to account for the faster excitation of high-lying vibrational states.},

Starting from an electronic specific Collisional-Radiative model, a reduction of the variable set (i.e., mass fractions and temperatures) is proposed by projecting the full set on a reduced basis made up of its principal components. Thus, the flow governing equations are only solved for the principal components. The proposed approach originates from the combustion community, where Manifold Generated Principal Component Analysis (MG-PCA) has been developed as a successful reduction technique. Applications consider ionizing shock waves in argon. The results obtained show that the use of the MG-PCA technique enables for a substantial reduction of the computational time.},

 abstract = {The effects of non-equilibrium in a quasi-one-dimensional nozzle flow are investigated by means of a collisional-radiative model. The gas undergoing the expansion is an air plasma and consists of atoms, molecules, and free electrons. In the present analysis, the electronic excited states of atomic and molecular species are treated as separate pseudo-species. Rotational and vibrational energy modes are assumed to be populated according to Boltzmann distributions. The coupling between radiation and gas dynamics is accounted for, in simplified manner, by using escape factors. The flow governing equations for the steady quasi-one-dimensional flow are written in conservative form and discretized in space by means of a finite volume method. Steady-state solutions are obtained by using a fully implicit time integration scheme. The analysis of the evolution of the electronic distribution functions reveals a substantial over-population of the high-lying excited levels of atoms and molecules in correspondence of the nozzle exit. The influence of optical thickness is also studied. The results clearly demonstrate that the radiative transitions, within the optically thin approximation, drastically reduce the over-population of high-lying electronic levels.},

 abstract = {The objective of the present work is the development of a tightly coupled magneto-hydrodynamic model for inductively coupled radio-frequency plasmas. Non Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) effects are described based on a hybrid State-to-State approach. A multi-temperature formulation is used to account for thermal non-equilibrium between translation of heavy-particles and vibration of molecules. Excited electronic states of atoms are instead treated as separate pseudo-species, allowing for non-Boltzmann distributions of their populations. Free-electrons are assumed Maxwellian at their own temperature. The governing equations for the electro-magnetic field and the gas properties (e.g., chemical composition and temperatures) are written as a coupled system of time-dependent conservation laws. Steady-state solutions are obtained by means of an implicit Finite Volume method. The results obtained in both LTE and NLTE conditions over a broad spectrum of operating conditions demonstrate the robustness of the proposed coupled numerical method. The analysis of chemical composition and temperature distributions along the torch radius shows that: (i) the use of the LTE assumption may lead to an inaccurate prediction of the thermo-chemical state of the gas, and (ii) non-equilibrium phenomena play a significant role close the walls, due to the combined effects of Ohmic heating and macroscopic gradients.},

 abstract = {A Boltzmann rovibrational collisional coarse-grained model is proposed to reduce a detailed kinetic mechanism database developed at NASA Ames Research Center for internal energy transfer and dissociation in N(2)-N interactions. The coarse-grained model is constructed by lumping the rovibrational energy levels of the N(2) molecule into energy bins. The population of the levels within each bin is assumed to follow a Boltzmann distribution at the local translational temperature. Excitation and dissociation rate coefficients for the energy bins are obtained by averaging the elementary rate coefficients. The energy bins are treated as separate species, thus allowing for non-Boltzmann distributions of their populations. The proposed coarse-grained model is applied to the study of nonequilibrium flows behind normal shock waves and within converging-diverging nozzles. In both cases, the flow is assumed inviscid and steady. Computational results are compared with those obtained by direct solution of the master equation for the rovibrational collisional model and a more conventional multitemperature model. It is found that the proposed coarse-grained model is able to accurately resolve the nonequilibrium dynamics of internal energy excitation and dissociation-recombination processes with only 20 energy bins. Furthermore, the proposed coarse-grained model provides a superior description of the nonequilibrium phenomena occurring in shock heated and nozzle flows when compared with the conventional multitemperature models.},

 abstract = {A rovibrational collisional model is developed to study the internal energy excitation and dissociation processes behind a strong shock wave in a nitrogen flow. The reaction rate coefficients are obtained from the ab initio database of the NASA Ames Research Center. The master equation is coupled with a one-dimensional flow solver to study the nonequilibrium phenomena encountered in the gas during a hyperbolic reentry into Earth's atmosphere. The analysis of the populations of the rovibrational levels demonstrates how rotational and vibrational relaxation proceed at the same rate. This contrasts with the common misconception that translational and rotational relaxation occur concurrently. A significant part of the relaxation process occurs in non-quasi-steady-state conditions. Exchange processes are found to have a significant impact on the relaxation of the gas, while predissociation has a negligible effect. The results obtained by means of the full rovibrational collisional model are used to assess the validity of reduced order models (vibrational collisional and multitemperature) which are based on the same kinetic database. It is found that thermalization and dissociation are drastically overestimated by the reduced order models. The reasons of the failure differ in the two cases. In the vibrational collisional model the overestimation of the dissociation is a consequence of the assumption of equilibrium between the rotational energy and the translational energy. The multitemperature model fails to predict the correct thermochemical relaxation due to the failure of the quasi-steady-state assumption, used to derive the phenomenological rate coefficient for dissociation. },

 abstract = {This work addresses the study of the behavior of the excited electronic states of CO molecules in the nonequilibrium relaxation zone behind a normal shock for a CO2-N2 mixture representative of the Mars atmosphere. The hybrid state-to-state (StS) model developed accounts for thermal nonequilibrium between the translational energy mode of the gas and the vibrational energy mode of individual molecules. The electronic states of CO molecules are treated as separate species, allowing for non-Boltzmann distributions of their populations. The StS model is coupled with a nonequilibrium radiation solver, hpc-rad, allowing for the calculation of the radiation signature from the molecular and atomic species in the gas. This study focuses on the radiation from the fourth positive system of CO, which dominates the radiation heating on the forebody for higher speed Mars entry applications. In the rapidly dissociating regime behind strong shock waves, the population of the ground electronic state of CO [CO(X1Σ)], departs from Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions, owing to the efficient collisional excitation to the electronically excited CO(A1Π) state. In general the assumption of the equilibrium between electronic and vibration fails when the excitation of electronic states is driven by heavy particles. The comparison of the radiation heating predictions obtained using the conventional quasi-steady-state (QSS) approach and the physics-based StS approach revealed differences in radiative heating predictions of up to 50%. These results demonstrate that the choice of nonequilibrium model can have a significant impact on radiative heating simulations, and more importantly, they cast serious doubts on the validity of the QSS assumption for the condition of interest to this work.},

 abstract = {The present work proposes a self-consistent reduced-order NLTE kinetic model for radiating plasmas found in the outer layers of stellar atmospheres. A detailed collisional-radiative kinetic mechanism is constructed by leveraging the most up-to-date set of ab initio and experimental data available in the literature. This constitutes the starting point for the derivation of a reduced-order model, obtained by lumping the bound energy states into groups. In order to determine the needed thermo-physical group properties, uniform and Maxwell–Boltzmann energy distributions are used to reconstruct the energy population of each group. Finally, the reduced set of governing equations for the material gas and the radiation field is obtained based on the moment method. Applications consider the steady flow across a shock wave in partially ionized hydrogen. The results clearly demonstrate that adopting a Maxwell–Boltzmann grouping allows, on the one hand, for a substantial reduction of the number of unknowns and, on the other, to maintain accuracy for both gas and radiation quantities. Also, it is observed that, when neglecting line radiation, the use of two groups already leads to a very accurate resolution of the photo-ionization precursor, internal relaxation, and radiative cooling regions. The inclusion of line radiation requires adopting just one additional group to account for optically thin losses in the α, β, and γ lines of the Balmer and Paschen series. This trend has been observed for a wide range of shock wave velocities.},

 abstract = {In this paper a spectral-Lagrangian method for the Boltzmann equation for a
multi-energy level gas is proposed. Internal energy levels are treated as
separate species and inelastic collisions (leading to internal energy
excitation and relaxation) are accounted for. The formulation developed can
also be used for the case of a mixture of monatomic gases without internal
energy (where only elastic collisions occur). The advantage of the
spectral-Lagrangian method lies in the generality of the algorithm in use for
the evaluation of the elastic and inelastic collision operators. The
computational procedure is based on the Fourier transform of the partial
elastic and inelastic collision operators and exploits the fact that these can
be written as weighted convolutions in Fourier space with no restriction on the
cross- section model. The conservation of mass, momentum and energy during
collisions is enforced through the solution of constrained optimization
problems. Numerical solutions are obtained for both space homogeneous and space
in- homogeneous problems. Computational results are compared with those
obtained by means of the DSMC method in order to assess the accuracy of the
proposed spectral-Lagrangian method.},

 abstract = {The present work proposes a self-consistent reduced-order NLTE kinetic model
for radiating plasmas such as are found in the outer layers of stellar
atmospheres. Starting from the most up-to-date set of ab-initio and
experimental data, the highly complex collisional-radiative kinetic mechanism
is simplified by lumping the bound energy states in groups. Different grouping
strategies are investigated, such as uniform and Maxwell-Boltzmann. The reduced
set of governing equations for the material gas and the radiation field is
obtained based on a moment method. Applications consider the steady flow across
a shock wave in partially ionized hydrogen. The results show that adopting a
Maxwell-Boltzmann grouping allows, on the one hand, for a substantial reduction
of the number of unknowns and, on the other, to maintain accuracy for both gas
and radiation quantities. It is observed that, when neglecting line radiation,
the use of two groups already leads to a very accurate resolution of the
photo-ionization precursor, internal relaxation and radiative cooling regions.
The inclusion of line radiation requires adopting just one additional group to
account for optically thin losses in the alpha, beta and gamma lines of the
Balmer and Paschen series. This trend has been observed for a wide range of
shock wave velocities.},

 abstract = {This work proposes a general framework for developing reduced-order models (including both kinetics and transport) for hypersonic flows in thermo-chemical non-equilibrium. Reduced-order modeling is achieved by lumping energy states in groups and by prescribing withing each group a local representation which maximizes the entropy under constraints of mass and energy conservation (Maximum Entropy Linear model; MEL). The governing equations for the group parameters are obtained by taking energy moments of the master equations. Applications consider the complexity reduction of the O2 molecule vibrational kinetics. The accuracy of the MEL model is assessed via comparison with State-to-State predictions in two cases: (i) isothermal chemical reactor (dissociating case) and (ii) Lagrangian nozzle flow (recombining case). In both circumstances results show an excellent agreement with the master equation solution. The MEL is then applied to simulate the steady axi-symmetric viscous flow within a nozzle. Results underline the importance of a proper characterization of non-equilibrium re-combination within nozzles in high-enthalpy wind tunnels. To the author’s best knowledge, this case marks the first attempt of integration of a self-consistent reduced-order model (i.e., MEL model) in a CFD solver for non-equilibrium flows.},

 abstract = {A non-equilibrium model for laser generated plasmas is validated and used to investigate plasma kernel dynamics. Breakdowns in quiescent air at different ambient conditions (e.g. pressure) for different laser parameters (e.g. power density and beam wavelength) are considered. The hydrodynamics is described based on the chemically reactive Navier–Stokes equations where non-equilibrium effects are accounted for using a three-temperature model. Laser-plasma interactions over nano-second time-scales are modeled with a radiative transfer equation (RTE), including both multiphoton ionization (MPI) and inverse Bremsstrahlung (IB). Validation is conducted by comparing absorbed energy and plasma emission with the corresponding experimental measurements, and by observations of the structure of the breakdown. The laser generated plasma exhibits a two-lobe structure, developing both in the forward and backward directions. An analysis of the dynamics suggests that the kernel evolution results from a radiation-driven wave that is: (i) triggered by MPI, (ii) sustained by energy deposition in IB interactions, which compensates for the energy lost by free-electrons in ionizing collisions, and (iii) guided by both MPI and ionization by electron impact (IE).},

 abstract = {A multi-physics numerical model for laser-induced optical breakdown and laser-plasma interaction in a non-equilibrium gas is presented, accounting for: production of priming electrons via multi-photon ionization, energy absorption, cascade ionization, induced hydrodynamic response, and shock formation and propagation. The gas is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, with non-equilibrium effects taken into account by means of a two-temperature model. The space-time dependence of the laser beam is modeled with a flux-tube formulation for the Radiative Transfer Equation. The flow governing equations are discretized in space using a second-order finite volume method. The semi-discrete equations are marched in time using an implicit-explicit (IMEX) dual time-stepping strategy, where diffusion and chemistry are solved implicitly, whereas convection is explicit. Application to a 20 ns long 50 mJ pulse laser-induced breakdown in quiescent O2 shows the advantages of this temporal discretization during and just after the laser pulse, while a less-expensive symmetric Strang splitting (with implicit chemistry) is sufficient for the post-breakdown gas dynamics after ≃ 0.1 μs. The integrated model is shown to reproduce key features of corresponding experiments.},

OH chemiluminescence is estimated using a detailed mechanism for the generation of OH* radicals and a simple one-parameter model for the absorption of chemiluminescence radiation. The effects of lumping of ionized species into their neutral counterparts are examined. It is observed that temperature-preserving lumping yields a good approximation of the fully ionized solution. Good agreement of the flame propagation rate is observed once the flame kernel grows above 0.5cm in radius; the rate of flame propagation is overpredicted for smaller radii. It is observed that the flame is not optically thin. Experimental time histories of chemiluminescence are predicted well, with room for improvement in the absorption model.},

 abstract = {Reliable computational prediction and modeling of high-enthalpy, hypersonic flows for certain aerospace applications are challenging due to coupling of multiphysics phenomena. The goal is to address some of the major gaps in existing hypersonic flow solvers, specifically the coupling of thermochemical nonequilibrium processes and turbulence. The primary issues considered with this coupling are the reliability of predictions over realistic geometries and the computational costs for its role in the design cycle. We extend the capability for aero-optical applications that is currently lacking in the existing hypersonic flow solvers. The authors are currently developing a computational tool for analysis of laminar and turbulent hypersonic external flow fields in non-equilibrium for a desired fidelity (high/low) using criteria driven by considerations of computational efficiency and accuracy of prediction, often provided by the design team. The paper describes the main features of the code, viz. numerical schemes (such as high-order accurate schemes), physical models (such as libraries for state-to-state kinetics solving master equation, lumped vibrational relaxation models and transport coefficients) and pre/post-processing modules. Validation tests and illustrative examples are presented to show its current state in the development.},

 abstract = {We present applications of laser-energy deposition for drag reduction in supersonic flow. The system of chemically reactive Navier–Stokes equations describes the hydrodynamics where nonequilibrium effects are accounted for by means of a two-temperature model. The propagation and attenuation of the laser beam are modeled based on a kinetic approach for photons (radiative transfer equation). Multiphoton ionization, inverse bremsstrahlung (free-free radiation), cascade ionization, and shock hydrodynamics are coupled self-consistently without imposing an initial plasma seed to initiate the breakdown, as is often done in the literature. Simulations are conducted in supersonic airflow over a spherical blunt body to study the control of aerodynamic forces. Results confirm that the laser-induced thermal spot can be effectively used to control the shock structures with beneficial effects in terms of aerodynamic loads. As a matter of fact, the interaction of the downstream advected hot spot with the bow shock distorts the latter (the lensing effect) and leads to toroidal vortices due to baroclinic torque. Drag is momentarily decreased due to the formation of an expansion fan (related to the upstream movement of the bow shock) that generates a load reduction on the wall, as well as to the advection of the vortex region that remains attached to the wall. The results also demonstrate that the self-consistent computational framework is able to handle complex multiscale multiphysics flow control problems for predictive applications without the assistance of tuning parameters and/or simplifying assumptions inferred from the experiments.},

The state-to-state kinetic database utilized for the master equation analysis includes N2+N2, N2+N, N2+O, O2+O2, O2+O, and NO+N systems. A novel investigation is done to calculate the rovibrational-specific rate coefficients of diatom+diatom collisional systems by means of the coarse-grain quasi-classical trajectory method. In the integration of the set of master equations, all of the considered kinetic processes are included together. The analysis in the present study reveals that the coupling phenomena between the dissociation reaction and internal energy transfer is governed by different chemical systems in the beginning of a molecular quasi-steady state period, and in its end region. In addition, the chemistry-internal energy coupling represents significantly different behavior along with rotational states for a given vibrational level for both the dissociation and heterogeneous exchange reactions. This observation implies the importance of rotational nonequilibrium in modeling of high-temperature air mixture. Finally, comparison of the present result with existing numerical models reveals significant level of discrepancy in species concentration evolution that motivates extension of the present work to wider range of temperatures as future investigation.},

 abstract = {The formation and growth of plasma kernels generated via nano-second mode-beating laser pulses is investigated here via a non-equilibrium self-consistent computational model. Chemically reactive Navier–Stokes equations are used to describe the hydrodynamics, and non-equilibrium effects are taken into account with a two-temperature model. Inverse Bremsstrahlung and multiphoton ionization are included self-consistently in the model via a coupled solution of the plasma governing equations and the radiative transfer equation (that describes the laser beam propagation and attenuation). A self-consistent approach (despite carrying additional challenges) minimizes the empiricism and it allows for a more accurate description since it prevents both the utilization of artificial plasma seeds to trigger the breakdown and the implementation of tuning parameters to simulate the laser-energy deposition. The advantages of this approach are confirmed by the good agreement between the numerically predicted and the experimentally measured plasma boundary evolution and absorbed energy. This also holds true for the periodic plasma kernel structures that, as suggested by the experiments and confirmed by the simulations presented here, are connected to the modulating frequency.},

 abstract = {This work presents a detailed investigation of the energy-transfer and dissociation mechanisms in N<sub>2</sub>(X<sup>1</sup>Σ<sub>g</sub><sup>+</sup>) + O(<sup>3</sup>P) and NO(X<sup>2</sup>Π) + N(<sup>4</sup>S) systems using rovibrational-specific quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) and master equation analyses. The complete set of state-to-state kinetic data, obtained via QCT, allows for an in-depth investigation of the Zel'dovich mechanism leading to the formation of NO molecules at microscopic and macroscopic scales. The master equation analysis demonstrates that the low-lying vibrational states of N<sub>2</sub> and NO have dominant contributions to the NO formation and the corresponding extinction of N<sub>2</sub> through the exchange process. For the considered temperature range, it is found that nearly 50% of the dissociation processes for N<sub>2</sub> and NO molecules occur in the quasi-steady-state (QSS) regime, while for the Zel'dovich reaction, the distribution of the reactants does not reach the QSS conditions. Furthermore, using the QSS approximation to model the Zel'dovich mechanism leads to overestimating NO production by more than a factor of 4 in the high-temperature range. The breakdown of this well-known approximation has profound consequences for the approaches that heavily rely on the validity of QSS assumption in hypersonic applications. Finally, the investigation of the rovibrational state population dynamics reveals substantial similarities among different chemical systems for the energy-transfer and the dissociation processes, providing promising physical foundations for the use of reduced-order strategies in other chemical systems without significant loss of accuracy.},

 abstract = {During the atmospheric entry phase at hypersonic speed, the radio communication from/to a space vehicle can be disrupted due to the formation of a plasma sheath within the surrounding flow field. In order to characterize such communication blackout phases, this work presents a numerical methodology combining Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations of ionized chemically reacting entry flows by means of Computational Object-Oriented Libraries for Fluid Dynamics (COOLFluiD) and a ray tracing analysis by means of the newly developed BlackOut RAy Tracer (BORAT). The latter is based on the numerical solution of the 3D Eikonal system of equations, offering a fast, efficient and accurate method to analyse the interaction between electromagnetic signals and weakly ionised plasmas. The proposed methodology, and BORAT in particular, is first verified on popular benchmark cases and then used to analyse the European Space Agency (ESA) 2016 ExoMars Schiaparelli entry flight into Martian environment. The corresponding results demonstrate the validity of the proposed ray tracing approach for predicting communication blackout, where signals emitted from the on-board antenna undergo reflection and refraction from the plasma surrounding the entry vehicle, and the advantage of a 3D approach for analysing real flight configuration.},

@article{pub.1164676156,
 abstract = {This work presents a vibrational and electronic state-to-state model for
nitrogen plasma implemented within a multi-physics modular computational
framework to study non-equilibrium effects in inductively coupled plasma (ICP)
discharges. Within the computational framework, the set of vibronic (i.e.,
vibrational and electronic) master equations are solved in a tightly coupled
fashion with the flow governing equations. This tight coupling eliminates the
need for invoking any simplifying assumptions when computing the state of the
plasma, thereby ensuring a higher degree of physical fidelity. To mitigate
computational complexity, a maximum entropy coarse-graining strategy is
deployed, effectively truncating the internal state space. The efficacy of this
reduced StS model is empirically substantiated through zero-dimensional
isochoric simulations. In these simulations, the results obtained from the
reduced-order model are rigorously compared against those obtained from the
full StS model, thereby confirming the accuracy of the reduced StS framework.
The developed Coarse-grained StS model was employed to study the plasma
discharge within the VKI Plasmatron facility. Our results reveal pronounced
discrepancies between the plasma flow fields obtained from StS simulations and
those derived from Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) models, which are
conventionally used in the simulation of such facilities. The analysis
demonstrates a substantial departure of the internal state populations of atoms
and molecules from the Boltzmann distribution. These nonequilibrium effects
have important consequences on the energy coupling dynamics, thereby impacting
the overall morphology of the plasma discharge. A deeper analysis of the
results demonstrates that the population distribution is in a
Quasi-Steady-State in the hot plasma core.},

 abstract = {This paper provides a comparison between the vibrational-specific
state-to-state (StS) model for nitrogen plasma elaborated in Part I of this
work and conventional two-temperature (2-T) models for simulating inductively
coupled plasma (ICP) discharges under non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium
(NLTE) conditions. Simulations are performed within the multi-physics
computational framework established for ICP in Part I. Based on the findings of
Part I, the quasi-steady-state (QSS) assumption is validated in the plasma
core, thereby enabling the calculation of global rate coefficients under this
assumption. This facilitates the reduction of the StS model to a "consistent"
macroscopic 2-T model. Results from the StS model for nitrogen ICP torch
exhibit considerable discrepancies when compared against predictions from the
widely utilized Park 2-T model. On the contrary, the comparison between the
newly proposed 2-T model, consistently derived from the original vibronic StS
model, and the full StS results demonstrate excellent agreement in terms of
plasma core location, morphology, and peak temperature distributions. This
demonstrates the ability of the proposed 2-T model to capture the energy
transfer and reactive processes predicted by the comprehensive StS model.
Additionally, the study identifies the vibrational-translational (VT) energy
transfer term in the 2-T model as the predominant factor in dictating plasma
core morphology. This suggests a strong sensitivity of the ICP flow field to
heavy-impact vibrational excitations and dissociative events.},
