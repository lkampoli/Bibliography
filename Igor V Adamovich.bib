 abstract = {This work presents the results of time-resolved electric field vector measurements in a short pulse duration (60 ns full width at half maximum), surface ionization wave discharge in hydrogen using a picosecond four-wave mixing technique. Electric field vector components are measured separately, using pump and Stokes beams linearly polarized in the horizontal and vertical planes, and a polarizer placed in front of the infrared detector. The time-resolved electric field vector is measured at three different locations across the discharge gap, and for three different heights above the alumina ceramic dielectric surface, ~100, 600, and 1100 μm (total of nine different locations). The results show that after breakdown, the discharge develops as an ionization wave propagating along the dielectric surface at an average speed of 1 mm ns−1. The surface ionization wave forms near the high voltage electrode, close to the dielectric surface (~100 μm). The wave front is characterized by significant overshoot of both vertical and horizontal electric field vector components. Behind the wave front, the vertical field component is rapidly reduced. As the wave propagates along the dielectric surface, it also extends further away from the dielectric surface, up to ~1 mm near the grounded electrode. The horizontal field component behind the wave front remains quite significant, to sustain the electron current toward the high voltage electrode. After the wave reaches the grounded electrode, the horizontal field component experiences a secondary rise in the quasi-dc discharge, where it sustains the current along the near-surface plasma sheet. The measurement results indicate presence of a cathode layer formed near the grounded electrode with significant cathode voltage fall, ≈3 kV, due to high current density in the discharge. The peak reduced electric field in the surface ionization wave is 85–95 Td, consistent with dc breakdown field estimated from the Paschen curve for hydrogen. The present set of data on electric field distribution in a surface ionization wave discharge provides an experimental reference for validation of kinetic models and assessing their predictive capability.},

 abstract = {Recent developments in the study of very high energy non-equilibrium fluid flows are reviewed. These are flows of molecular gases which exhibit substantial degrees of mode disequilibrium, specifically high energy in molecular vibrational and electronic modes, and high electron energies when the gases are weakly ionized. In contrast, the modes of molecular translation and rotation remain at lower energies. Attention is focused on high density, collision-dominated gases. Studies in two systems are presented: A small wind tunnel where an M=5 steady air flow over small models is produced, and a flowing carbon monoxide gas laser, exhibiting very high energy loading of the vibrational quantum states. The development of non-intrusive optical diagnostics to measure vibrational and electronic state populations and rotational/translational mode temperatures in the flows, with high spatial and temporal resolution, is presented. Kinetic modeling and experimental validation studies in these environments are also discussed.},

 abstract = {The present kinetic modelling calculation results provide key new insights into the kinetics of vibrational excitation of nitrogen and plasma chemical reactions in nanosecond pulse, ‘diffuse filament’ discharges in nitrogen and dry air at a moderate energy loading per molecule, ∼0.1 eV per molecule. It is shown that it is very important to take into account Coulomb collisions between electrons because they change the electron energy distribution function and, as a result, strongly affect populations of excited states and radical concentrations in the discharge. The results demonstrate that the apparent transient rise of N2 ‘first level’ vibrational temperature after the discharge pulse, as detected in the experiments, is due to the net downward V–V energy transfer in N2–N2 collisions, which increases the N2(X 1Σ, v = 1) population. Finally, a comparison of the model's predictions with the experimental data shows that NO formation in the afterglow occurs via reactive quenching of multiple excited electronic levels of nitrogen molecule, , by O atoms.},

 abstract = {A computational study of Mach 5 airflow over a cylinder with a dielectric barrier discharge actuator was performed. The actuator was pulsed at nanosecond time scales and it rapidly added thermal energy to the flow, creating a shock wave that traveled away from the pulse source. As the shock wave traveled upstream, it interacted with the standing bow shock, and temporarily increased the bow shock standoff distance. This phenomenon was also observed experimentally through phase-locked schlieren photography. This paper aims to reproduce flow phenomena observed in the experiment using high-fidelity computations in order to provide additional insight into the shock–shock interaction, and subsequent effect on the cylinder, through a reduced-order phenomenological model of the actuator. A three-dimensional simulation of the experiment was able to accurately capture the complex cylinder/tunnel-sidewall interaction, and to replicate the changes in the flow produced by the nanosecond dielectric barrier discharge. The results show that the device was very effective at moving the standing bow shock for a minimal energy budget.},

 abstract = {The effect of nanosecond pulsed plasma discharges on a laminar, lean (ϕ=0.5) premixed H2/O2/N2 flame is studied at low pressure (25Torr) using a novel plasma–flame facility, non-intrusive laser diagnostics, and high-fidelity numerical simulations. Spatially-resolved, quantitative OH mole fraction and temperature measurements are performed with and without a burst of 200 discharge pulses using laser-induced fluorescence. Measured temperatures increase by ∼20% in both the pre-heat and post-flame zones with the use of the plasma discharge. In addition, OH mole fractions increase by as much as 500% in the preheat zone and by 40% in the post-flame gases. Simulations are conducted with a one-dimensional, multi-scale, pulsed-discharge model with detailed plasma-combustion kinetics to develop additional insight into the complex plasma and flame interactions. Good agreement between measured and predicted OH and temperature profiles provides confidence in the model framework. The reduced electric field, E/N, varies inversely with number density during each pulse. A significant fraction of the input energy is consumed during electron impact ionization processes in the high E/N (700–1000Td) regions downstream of the flame. Lower E/N values (100–700Td) in the lower-temperature preheat zone promote efficient generation of radicals and excited species via electron impact processes, as well as by collisional quenching of excited states. The plasma action results in a significant increase in O and H atom density, with the peak values increasing by a factor of 6 and 4 respectively. In presence of the discharge, species and temperature profiles shift upstream (closer to the burner) by approximately 0.2cm. Simulations show that electron impact dissociation and excitation processes in the plasma have a major impact on the observed temperature and species profile displacement, such that Joule heating alone does not account for the observed effects of the plasma.},

Two different plasma sources, both of which generate uniform, low-temperature, volumetric, non-equilibrium plasma discharges, are used to study changes in chemiluminescence, temperature, and OH concentration when non-equilibrium plasmas are directly coupled to conventional hydrogen/hydrocarbon oxidation and combustion chemistry. Qualitative imaging of CH* chemiluminescence indicates that during plasma discharge, the luminous flame zone is shifted upstream towards the burner surface with little change in the CH* zone thickness. For the same plasma discharge and flame conditions, quantitative results using spatially-resolved OH LIF and multi-line, OH-LIF thermometry show significant increases in ground-state OH concentrations in the preheating zones of the flame. More specifically, for a particular axial position downstream of the burner surface, the OH concentration increases, which can be viewed as an effective “shift” of the OH profiles towards the burner surface. The increase in OH concentration is conceivably due to an enhancement of the lower-temperature kinetics including O atom, H atom and OH formation kinetics and temperature rise due to the presence of the low-temperature, non-equilibrium plasma.},

 abstract = {Nanosecond pulse discharge plasma imaging, coupled pulse energy measurements, and kinetic modeling are used to analyze the mechanism of energy coupling in high repetition rate, spatially uniform, nanosecond pulse discharges in air in plane-to-plane geometry. Under these conditions, coupled pulse energy scales nearly linearly with pressure (number density), with energy coupled per molecule being nearly constant, in good agreement with the kinetic model predictions. In spite of high-peak reduced electric field reached before breakdown, E/N ∼ 500–700 Td, the reduced electric field in the plasma after breakdown is much lower, E/N ∼ 50–100 Td, predicting that a significant fraction of energy coupled to the air plasma, up to 30–40%, is loaded into nitrogen vibrational mode.A self-similar, local ionization kinetic model predicting energy coupling to the plasma in a surface ionization wave discharge produced by a nanosecond voltage pulse has been developed. The model predicts key discharge parameters such as ionization wave speed and propagation distance, electric field, electron density, plasma layer thickness, and pulse energy coupled to the plasma, demonstrating good qualitative agreement with experimental data and two-dimensional kinetic modeling calculations. The model allows an analytic solution and lends itself to incorporation into existing compressible flow codes, at very little computational cost, for in-depth analysis of the nanosecond discharge plasma flow control mechanism. The use of the model would place the main emphasis on coupling of localized thermal perturbations produced by the discharge with the flow via compression waves and would provide quantitative insight into the flow control mechanism on a long time scale.},

 abstract = {Time-resolved and spatially resolved temperature measurements, by pure rotational picosecond broadband coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS), and kinetic modeling calculations are used to study kinetics of energy thermalization in nanosecond pulse discharges in air and hydrogen–air mixtures. The diffuse filament, nanosecond pulse discharge (pulse duration ∼100 ns) is sustained between two spherical electrodes and is operated at a low pulse repetition rate to enable temperature measurements over a wide range of time scales after the discharge pulse. The experimental results demonstrate high accuracy of pure rotational ps CARS for thermometry measurements in highly transient non-equilibrium plasmas. Rotational–translational temperatures are measured for time delays after the pulse ranging from tens of ns to tens of ms, spanning several orders of magnitude of time scales for energy thermalization in non-equilibrium plasmas. In addition, radial temperature distributions across the plasma filament are measured for several time delays after the discharge pulse. Kinetic modeling calculations using a state-specific master equation kinetic model of reacting hydrogen–air plasmas show good agreement with experimental data. The results demonstrate that energy thermalization and temperature rise in these plasmas occur in two clearly defined stages, (i) ‘rapid’ heating, caused by collisional quenching of excited electronic states of N2 molecules by O2, and (ii) ‘slow’ heating, caused primarily by N2 vibrational relaxation by O atoms (in air) and by chemical energy release during partial oxidation of hydrogen (in H2–air). The results have major implications for plasma assisted combustion and plasma flow control.},

 abstract = {Time- and space-resolved temperature and absolute concentrations of OH and H are measured by UV Rayleigh scattering, Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF), and Two-Photon Absorption LIF (TALIF), respectively, in an Ar–O2–H2 (80:20:2) mixture at P=40torr and T0=300K. The mixture is excited by a 50-pulse burst from a repetitive nanosecond pulse discharge (NSPD) in a point-to-point geometry, operated at 100kHz pulse repetition rate and 5Hz burst repetition rate. One-dimensional radial distributions of temperature and species concentrations across the discharge filament, during and after the burst, are obtained from Rayleigh scattering and fluorescence images of the laser beam. Both temperature and species concentration profiles are found to expand with time, with peak centerline values of Tpeak≈1200K, [H]peak≈6.0⋅1015cm−3, and [OH]peak≈1.0·1015cm−3. Secondary maxima in OH distributions are detected near the periphery of the filament after a few tens of discharge pulses. Experimental results are compared with predictions of a plasma chemical kinetics model. The model reproduces trends in temporal evolution of radial distributions of temperature, as well as OH and H concentrations. Based on a rate of species production analysis, the secondary peaks in OH radial distributions are found to be caused by radial diffusion of H atoms from the central region of the discharge filament, with subsequent formation of HO2 and OH via reactions H+O2+M→HO2+M and H+HO2→OH+OH in the low-temperature peripheral regions. The results demonstrate significant potential of the present approach for quantitative, time- and spatially-resolved studies of coupled radical reaction kinetics and diffusion over a wide range of temperatures, pressures, and mixture compositions.},

 abstract = {Recent experiments with a nanosecond-pulse, dielectric barrier discharge at the stagnation point of a Mach 5 cylinder flow have demonstrated the formation of weak shock waves near the electrode edge, which propagate upstream and perturb the bow shock. This is a promising means of flow control, and understanding the detailed physics of the conversion of electrical energy into gas motion will aid in the design of efficient actuators based on the concept. In this work, a simplified configuration with planar symmetry was chosen as a vehicle to develop a physics-based model of nanosecond-pulse discharges, including realistic air kinetics, electron energy transport, and compressible bulk gas flow. A reduced plasma kinetic model (23 species and 50 processes) was developed to capture the dominant species and reactions for energy storage and thermalization in the discharge. The kinetic model included electronically and vibrationally excited species, and several species of ions and ground state neutrals. The governing equations included the Poisson equation for the electric potential, diffusion equations for each neutral species, conservation equations for each charged species, and mass-averaged conservation equations for the bulk gas flow. The results of calculations with this model highlighted the path of energy transfer in the discharge. At breakdown, the input electrical energy was transformed over a time scale on the order of 1 ns into chemical energy of ions, dissociation products, and vibrationally and electronically excited particles. About 30% of this energy was subsequently thermalized over a time scale of 10 µs. Since the thermalization time scale was faster than the acoustic time scale, the heat release led to the formation of weak shock waves originating near the sheath edge, consistent with experimental observations. The computed translational temperature rise (40 K) and nitrogen vibrational temperature rise (370 K) were of the same order of magnitude as experimental measurements (50 K and 500 K, respectively), and the approach appears promising for future multi-dimensional calculations. The effectiveness of flow control actuators based on nanosecond-pulse, dielectric barrier discharges is seen to depend crucially on the rapid thermalization of input energy, in particular the rate of quenching of excited electronic states and the rate of electron–ion recombination.},

The gas temperature and the CO vibrational level populations in the reaction region, as well as the CO2 concentration in the reaction products have been measured using FTIR emission and absorption spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that CO2 formation in the optically pumped reactor is controlled by the high CO vibrational level populations, rather than by CO partial pressure or by flow temperature. The disproportionation reaction rate constant has been determined from the measured CO2 and CO concentrations using the perfectly stirred reactor (PSR) approximation. The reaction activation energy, 11.6±0.3eV (close to the CO dissociation energy of 11.09eV), was evaluated using the statistical transition state theory, by comparing the dependence of the measured CO2 concentration and of the calculated reaction rate constant on helium partial pressure. The disproportionation reaction rate constant measured at the present conditions is kf=(9±4)×10−18cm3/s. The reaction rate constants obtained from the experimental measurements and from the transition state theory are in good agreement.},

 abstract = {This work describes the kinetic mechanism of coupled molecular energy transfer and chemical reactions in low-temperature air, H2-air and hydrocarbon-air plasmas sustained by nanosecond pulse discharges (single-pulse or repetitive pulse burst). The model incorporates electron impact processes, state-specific N(2) vibrational energy transfer, reactions of excited electronic species of N(2), O(2), N and O, and 'conventional' chemical reactions (Konnov mechanism). Effects of diffusion and conduction heat transfer, energy coupled to the cathode layer and gasdynamic compression/expansion are incorporated as quasi-zero-dimensional corrections. The model is exercised using a combination of freeware (Bolsig+) and commercial software (ChemKin-Pro). The model predictions are validated using time-resolved measurements of temperature and N(2) vibrational level populations in nanosecond pulse discharges in air in plane-to-plane and sphere-to-sphere geometry; temperature and OH number density after nanosecond pulse burst discharges in lean H(2)-air, CH(4)-air and C(2)H(4)-air mixtures; and temperature after the nanosecond pulse discharge burst during plasma-assisted ignition of lean H2-mixtures, showing good agreement with the data. The model predictions for OH number density in lean C(3)H(8)-air mixtures differ from the experimental results, over-predicting its absolute value and failing to predict transient OH rise and decay after the discharge burst. The agreement with the data for C(3)H(8)-air is improved considerably if a different conventional hydrocarbon chemistry reaction set (LLNL methane-n-butane flame mechanism) is used. The results of mechanism validation demonstrate its applicability for analysis of plasma chemical oxidation and ignition of low-temperature H(2)-air, CH(4)-air and C(2)H(4)-air mixtures using nanosecond pulse discharges. Kinetic modelling of low-temperature plasma excited propane-air mixtures demonstrates the need for development of a more accurate 'conventional' chemistry mechanism.},

 abstract = {The paper addresses several problems of kinetics of spatially nonhomogeneous, vibrationally excited gas flows. It is shown that vibrational energy transfer in most diatomic molecules does not affect the transport coefficients of gas, despite very fast vibration-to-vibration (V—V) rates among high vibrational levels. The influence of diffusion and the vibration-to-electronic (V—E) energy transfer on the vibrational distribution function (VDF) and on the vibrational energy balance is discussed. The diffusion and V—E corrections of the VDF and to the gas heating rate in vibrational relaxation is obtained for the “strong” excitation regime. The effect of the non-local diagnostics on the VDF is connsdered. It is shown that the spatial integration may significantly influence the inferred distribution function, as has been previously reported in experiments. A new approach for kinetic modeling of nonhomogeneous, vibrationally nonequilibrium flows is suggested. A two-dimensional kinetic model is developed which combines vibrational and translational energy balance and gas motion equations with the analytical theory of anharmonic oscillators. The comparison of the model calculations with both 1D and 2D experiments shows reasonable agreement within the applicability of the gas flow model.},

 abstract = {Picosecond coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) is used to study vibrational energy loading and relaxation kinetics in nitrogen and air ns pulsed non-equilibrium plasmas, in both plane-to-plane and pin-to-pin geometries. In 10 kHz repetitively pulsed plane-to-plane plasmas, up to ∼50% of coupled discharge power is found to load vibrations, in good agreement with a master equation kinetic model. In the pin-to-pin geometry, ∼40% of total discharge energy in a single pulse in air at 100 Torr is found to couple directly to nitrogen vibrations by electron impact, also in good agreement with model predictions. Post-discharge, the total quanta in vibrational levels v = 0–9 is found to increase by ∼60% in air and by a factor of ∼3 in nitrogen, respectively, a result in direct contrast to modelling results which predict the total number of quanta to be essentially constant until ultimately decaying by V–T relaxation and mass diffusion. More detailed comparison between experiment and model show that the vibrational distribution function (VDF) predicted by the model during, and directly after, the discharge pulse is in good agreement with that determined experimentally. However, for time delays exceeding ∼1 µs, the experimental VDF shows populations of vibrational levels v ⩾ 2 greatly exceeding modelling results, which predict their predominant decay due to net downward V–V transfer and corresponding increase in v = 1 population. This is at variance with the experimental results, which show a significant monotonic increase in the populations of levels v = 2–9 at t ∼ 1–10 µs after the discharge pulse, both in nitrogen and air, before gradually switching to relaxation at t ∼ 10–100 µs. It is concluded that a collisional process is likely feeding high vibrational levels at a rate which is comparable to the rate at which population of the high levels is lost due to net downward V–V energy transfer. A likely candidate for the source of additional vibrational quanta is quenching of metastable electronic states of nitrogen to highly excited vibrational levels of the ground electronic state. The effect of electronic-vibrational (E–V) coupling on time-resolved N2 vibrational populations and temperature, estimated using a phenomenological E–V energy transfer model, provides qualitative interpretation of the present experimental results.},

 abstract = { Ignition of preheated (400–500K) H2–air mixtures at low pressures (80–100torr) excited by pulsed nanosecond dielectric barrier discharges is investigated through experiments and simulations. Time resolved absolute OH concentration and temperature data are obtained using Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) technique. Ignition is achieved in the decaying plasma after a burst of discharge pulses (repetition rate 10–40kHz), with the time delay inferred from sudden rise in OH* emission. One-dimensional simulations are performed to obtain information about the plasma generated radicals and heat release across the discharge gap. A plasma fluid formulation is used with ions and neutral species at gas temperature, and electrons in non-equilibrium. An accurate reduced chemistry mechanism is developed through sensitivity analysis to expedite the plasma simulations. The model predictions show excellent agreement with experimental measurements, validating the numerical framework and chemistry data. The input pulse energy and ignition characteristics are found to be highly sensitive to uncertainties in dielectric properties. Ignition delay exhibits a threshold-like dependence on input plasma energy, and increases steeply as the number of pulses in the burst is reduced. The nanosecond plasma assisted ignition is achieved through a two-step process. Firstly, the burst of discharge pulses produce a large pool of radicals and provide an average temperature rise of ∼1–2K/pulse. In the next step, if the temperature exceeds a threshold value of ∼700K, significant heat release from partial fuel oxidation is triggered. The process becomes self-sustaining and the temperature continues to rise even after the plasma source is switched off, accelerating the conventional H2–O2 chain branching pathways and leading to ignition. We provide conclusive evidence of large volume ignition with nanosecond plasma as opposed to thermal ignition at a hot-spot. Ignition is first observed at the center of the discharge gap, but the kernel expands rapidly to the entire volume, except near walls where heat losses keep the temperature low. It is demonstrated that the ignition occurs independently at different locations due to local plasma chemistry effects and heat transport does not play a significant role.},

 abstract = {Abstract Over the last decade, there has been considerable interest in the use of plasmas generated over high‐speed vehicles for flow control and energy management. Plasma flow control does not use moving parts, and can be turned on and off on a very short time scale. In laboratory experiments, thermal plasmas, laser‐induced breakdown, as well as various types of surface and volume‐filling electric discharge plasmas, have been widely used to modify both subsonic and supersonic flows. Potential plasma flow control applications include drag reduction, boundary layer separation and transition control, mixing enhancement, shock wave modification, wave drag reduction, and on‐board electrical power generation. Primary mechanisms of plasma flow control include magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and electrohydrodynamic (EHD) interactions, as well as thermal methods using Joule heating of the flow. This article provides a brief overview of the main concepts and methods of plasma flow control.},

This evokes interest in different diagnostic methods when applied to HVAPD plasma. Unfortunately, the high nonuniformity and large temperature gradients in HVAPD make it impossible to use the traditional methods of diagnostics.},

 abstract = {A method for direct measurements of electron number density, ionization rate, and the electron–ion recombination rate coefficient in optically pumped non-equilibrium plasmas has been developed. In this method, a pulsed, non-self-sustained discharge created by applying square-shaped, below breakdown voltage pulses to two electrodes placed outside the plasma (a Thomson probe) is used to remove electrons from the plasma. The electron number density is inferred for CO/Ar and CO/N2 optical mixtures with small amounts of O2 additive present. The results are compared with microwave attenuation measurements. The electron–ion recombination rate coefficients in CO/Ar/O2 and in CO/N2/O2 plasmas are β = (3–4) × 10−8 cm3 s−1 and β = (2–3) × 10−7 cm3 s−1, respectively. Time-dependent measurements of the electron concentration and vacuum ultraviolet radiation (CO fourth positive system) are used to study the mechanism of CO(A1Π) population in the optically pumped plasma. The experimental results are compared with kinetic modelling calculations. The results systematically show that the intensity of the CO fourth positive radiation closely follows the electron number density in the laser-excited plasma region after the Thomson probe voltage is turned on or off. This demonstrates that electrons play a major role in the excitation of the A1Π electronic state of CO and provides additional evidence that vibrational-to-electronic (V–E) energy transfer in plasmas sustained without external electric fields is mediated by collisions with electrons.},

 abstract = {An integrated theoretical and numerical framework is developed to study the dynamics of energy coupling, gas heating and generation of active species by repetitively pulsed nanosecond dielectric barrier discharges (NS DBDs) in air. The work represents one of the first attempts to simulate, in a self-consistent manner, multiple (more than 100) nanosecond pulses. Detailed information is obtained about the electric-field transients during each voltage pulse, and accumulation of plasma generated species and gas heating over ms timescales. The plasma is modelled using a two-temperature, detailed chemistry scheme, with ions and neutral species in thermal equilibrium at the gas temperature, and electrons in thermal nonequilibrium. The analysis is conducted with pressures and pulsing frequency in the range 40–100 Torr and 1–105 Hz, respectively. The input electrical energy is directly proportional to the number density, and remains fairly constant on a per molecule basis from pulse to pulse. Repetitive pulsing results in uniform production of atomic oxygen in the discharge volume via electron-impact dissociation during voltage pulses, and through quenching of excited nitrogen molecules in the afterglow. The ion Joule effect causes rapid gas heating of ∼40 K/pulse in the cathode sheath and generates weak acoustic waves. Conductive heat loss to the walls during the time interval between voltage pulses prevents overheating of the cathode layer and development of ionization instabilities. A uniform ‘hat-shaped’ temperature profile develops in the discharge volume after multiple pulses, due to chemical heat release from quenching of excited species. This finding may explain experimentally observed volumetric ignition (as opposed to hot-spot ignition) in fuel–air mixtures subject to NS DBD.},

 abstract = {The paper presents the results of iodine vapour dissociation measurements in a high voltage, nanosecond pulse duration, repetitively pulsed discharge, used as an auxiliary ('side') discharge in an electric discharge excited oxygen–iodine laser. The side discharge, sustained in a high-pressure iodine vapour/helium mixture remained stable in the entire range of experimental conditions. Iodine dissociation fraction generated in the side discharge and measured in the laser cavity is up to 50%. However, the experiments showed that additional iodine dissociation generated in the side discharge only moderately increases laser gain, by 10–15%. Parametric gain optimization by varying main discharge pressure, O2 and NO fractions in the flow, I2 flow rate, pulsed discharge frequency and sustainer discharge power, with the side discharge in operation produces gain up to 0.08% cm−1. Two parameters that critically affect gain are the energy loading per molecule in the discharge and the NO flow rate controlling the O atom concentration in the flow. In particular, operation at the main discharge pressure of 60 Torr results in significantly higher gain than at 100 Torr, 0.080% cm−1 versus 0.043% cm−1, due to higher discharge energy loading per molecule at the lower pressure. Laser output power measured at the gain optimized conditions is 1.4 W.},

Inferred rate coefficients, k0,1v,v-1, equal to 2.6±.5, 4.3±1.1×10−13cm3s−1 for levels v=2 and 3 are found to agree, within the combined quoted uncertainty, with the recent data of Kalogerakis.

In agreement with earlier observations by Diskin, it is found that previous semi-classical trajectory calculations underestimate O2 V–V kinetics by approximately one order of magnitude. New calculations, invoking the same semi-classical formalism, require an increase in the attractive part of the intermolecular potential by a factor of approximately 1.75, in order to replicate the experimental data, a result which is considered non-physical. The purely repulsive Forced Harmonic Oscillator – Free Rotator model of Adamovich is found to under predict the absolute rates by a factor of approximately eight, but to predict the relative rates with reasonable accuracy.},

 abstract = {The kinetics of ionization and electron removal in optically pumped non-equilibrium plasmas sustained by a CO laser are studied using non-self-sustained dc and RF electric discharges. Experiments in optically pumped CO/Ar/N2 mixtures doped with O2 and NO demonstrated that associative ionization of CO produces free electrons at a rate up to S = 1015 cm-3 s-1. The ionization rate coefficient, inferred from the CO vibrational population measurements, is kion = (1.1-1.8)×10-13 cm3 s-1. It is shown that excited NO and possibly O2 molecules also contribute to the vibrationally stimulated ionization process. In a CO/Ar plasma, applying a dc bias to the cell electrodes resulted in the rapid accumulation of a deposit on the negative electrode due to a large cluster ion current. The average mass of an ion in this plasma, estimated by measuring the mass of the deposit, is m250 amu, which is consistent with the mass spectrometer analysis of the deposit. The deposit did not accumulate when small amounts of O2 and NO were added to the CO/Ar plasma, which presumably indicates the destruction of the cluster ions.  It is demonstrated that adding small amounts of O2 to the optically pumped CO/Ar plasmas significantly increases the electron density, from ne = (4-7)×109 cm-3 to ne = (1-2)×1011 cm-3. This effect occurs at a nearly constant (within 50%) electron production rate S, indicating a substantial reduction in the overall electron removal rate. This reduction can be qualitatively interpreted as the destruction of rapidly recombining cluster ions in the presence of the O2 additive, and their replacement by monomer ions with a slower recombination rate. Further studies of the ion composition in optically pumped plasmas are suggested.},

The premixed fuel–air flow in the reactor, initially at T0=500K and P=100torr, is excited by a repetitive ns pulse discharge in a plane-to-plane geometry (peak voltage 28kV, discharge gap 10mm, estimated pulse energy 1.25mJ/pulse), operated in burst mode at 10kHz pulse repetition rate. In most measurements, burst duration is limited to 50 pulses, to preclude plasma-assisted ignition. The discharge uniformity in air and fuel–air flows is verified using sub-ns-gated images (employing an intensified charge-coupled device camera). Temperatures measured at the end of the discharge burst are in the range of T=550–600K, using both OH LIF and CARS, and remain essentially unchanged for up to 10ms after the burst. Time-resolved temperature measured by CARS during plasma-assisted ignition of H2-air is in good agreement with kinetic model predictions. Based on CARS measurement, vibrational nonequilibrium is not a significant factor at the present conditions.Time-resolved, absolute OH number density, measured after the discharge burst, demonstrates that OH concentration in C2H4-air, C3H8-air, and CH4 is highest in lean mixtures. In H2-air, OH concentration is nearly independent of the equivalence ratio. In C2H4-air and C3H8-air, unlike in CH4-air and in H2-air, transient OH-concentration overshoot after the discharge is detected. In C2H4-air and C3H8-air, OH decays after the discharge on the time scale of ∼0.02–0.1ms, suggesting little accumulation during the burst of pulses repeated at 10kHz. In CH4-air and H2-air, OH concentration decays within ∼0.1–1.0ms and 0.5–1.0ms, respectively, showing that it may accumulate during the burst.The experimental results are compared with kinetic modeling calculations using plasma/fuel chemistry model employing several H2-air and hydrocarbon-air chemistry mechanisms. Kinetic mechanisms for H2-air, CH4-air, and C2H4-air developed by A. Konnov provide the best overall agreement with OH measurements. In C3H8-air, none of the hydrocarbon chemistry mechanisms agrees well with the data. The results show the need for development of an accurate, predictive low-temperature plasma chemistry/fuel chemistry kinetic model applicable to fuels C3 and higher.},

 abstract = {Ignition delay time, time-resolved temperature, and time-resolved absolute OH concentration are measured in mildly preheated H2–air mixtures (T=473–500K), excited by a repetitive nanosecond pulse discharge in a plasma flow reactor. The measurements are done in decaying plasma after the discharge pulse burst (pulse repetition rate 10–40kHz). Ignition delay increases steeply as the number of pulses in the burst is reduced, exhibiting threshold-like behavior. Temperature and OH concentration during the ignition process are measured by two-line OH LIF, as functions of time delay after the discharge burst. Absolute calibration is done using a near-adiabatic flame. The results show that the temperature at the end of the discharge burst is 700–750K, rising to 1500–1600K within a few ms after the burst, indicative of ignition. During ignition, OH concentration increases by a factor of 20–50, from (0.5–1.1)×1014cm−3 at the end of the burst to peak value of (2.3–2.6)×1015cm−3. Kinetic modeling calculations show good agreement with the experimental results, demonstrating quantitative insight into kinetics of plasma-assisted ignition. Modeling calculations demonstrate that ignition is induced primarily by accumulation of H atoms and gradual temperature rise in the discharge, at temperatures significantly lower than autoignition temperature, by up to 200K.},

 abstract = {Repetitive nanosecond pulse plasma assisted ignition and flameholding of premixed and non-premixed ethylene–air and hydrogen–air flows are studied in a cavity flow at a pressure of 0.2atm and flow velocities of up to 100m/s. Ignition occurs via formation of multiple filaments in the fuel–air plasma, although air plasma remains diffuse until the fuel is added. After ignition occurs in the cavity, with ignition delay time of a few milliseconds, the plasma becomes diffuse and the flame couples out to the main flow. The use of a short cavity (length-to-depth ratio L/D=1) results in repetitive ignition and flame blow-off, caused by slow mixing between the main flow and the cavity. Increasing the length-to-depth ratio to L/D=3, as well as choking inlet air and fuel flows resulted in stable flameholding and nearly complete combustion in both premixed and non-premixed ethylene–air and hydrogen–air flows at u=35–100m/s. Air plasma temperature before fuel is added ranges from 70°C to 200°C. When the nanosecond pulse discharge is operated in repetitive burst mode, continuous ethylene–air flame is maintained only at a high duty cycle, which increases with the flow velocity. In hydrogen–air, the flame remains stable after the plasma is turned off. Nanosecond pulse discharge ignition of ethylene–air is compared with ignition by DC arc discharge of approximately the same power. DC arc discharge results in sporadic ignition and flame blow-off, much lower burned fuel fraction, and significantly lower flow velocity at which ignition can be achieved. Kinetic modeling is used to identify the reduced mechanism of plasma chemical oxidation and ignition of hydrogen, and to demonstrate the mechanism of energy release low-temperature reactions of radicals generated in the plasma (primarily O and H atoms).},

 abstract = {Ionization in vibrationally excited CO is investigated. The carbon monoxide is excited by resonance absorption of CO laser radiation and subsequent vibration-vibration (V-V) pumping in an optical cell. Ionization involving CO molecules at high vibrational states occurs in the laser beam region. Thus, a non-self-sustained electric discharge (Thomson discharge), supported by the laser beam, is ignited between two plane electrodes placed in the cell. The applied voltage does not exceed the breakdown voltage for the cell gases. The measured discharge current is several microamperes. The discharge voltage-current characteristic satisfactory corresponds to the Thomson discharge theory. This allows measuring the ionization rate in the plasma with an accuracy of a factor of 2. The vibrational distribution function (VDF) of CO in the cell is measured by infrared emission spectroscopy. It is shown that the CO vibrational levels are strongly overpopulated up to level v=40. By adding helium to the CO-Ar mixture it is demonstrated that definite correlation exists between the discharge current and the high vibrational level populations. It is concluded that the ionization occurs in collisions of two vibrationally excited CO molecules. An ionization rate constant for this process of ki=(8±5)×10−15 cm3/s is inferred from the VDF measurements. Since the Thomson discharge environment allows regulation of the electron concentration by changing the applied voltage, it becomes possible to investigate the influence of electrons on the VDF. The effect of vibration-to-electron (V-e) coupling is measured in the experiment for the first time. This property of the Thomson discharge makes it very promising for a thorough investigation of the interaction between electrons and highly vibrationally excited molecules.},

 abstract = {The paper presents the results of time-resolved electric field measurements in a nanosecond discharge between two plane electrodes covered by dielectric plates, using picosecond four-wave mixing diagnostics. For absolute calibration, the IR signal was measured in hydrogen at a pressure of 440 Torr, for electrostatic electric field ranging from 0 to 8 kV cm−1. The calibration curve (i.e. the square root of IR signal intensity versus electric field) was shown to be linear. By measuring the intensities of the pump, Stokes, and IR signal beam for each laser shot during the time sweep across the high-voltage pulse, temporal evolution of the electric field in the nanosecond pulse discharge was determined with sub-nanosecond time resolution. The results are compared to kinetic modeling predictions, showing good agreement, including non-zero electric field offset before the main high voltage pulse, breakdown moment, and reduction of electric field in the plasma after breakdown. The difference between the experimental results and model predictions is likely due to non-1D structure of the discharge. Comparison with the kinetic modeling predictions shows that electric field in the nanosecond pulse discharge is controlled primarily by electron impact excitation and charge accumulation on the dielectric surfaces.},

 abstract = {Xenon calibrated two photon absorption laser induced fluorescence (TALIF) is used to measure absolute atomic oxygen concentrations in air, methane–air, and ethylene–air non-equilibrium plasmas, as a function of time after initiation of a single 25ns discharge pulse. Peak mole fraction in air at 60torr is ∼0.5×10−4, with decay occurring on a time scale of ∼2ms. Peak mole fraction in a stoichiometric methane–air mixture is found to be approximately equal to that in pure air, but the rate of decay is found to be faster by a factor of approximately two to three. In Φ=0.5 ethylene–air, peak atomic oxygen concentration is reduced by a factor of approximately four, relative to air, and the rate of decay increased by approximately two orders of magnitude due to the greatly increased rate of reaction of atomic oxygen with ethylene, as compared to methane, at room temperature. Discharge kinetic modeling calculations, using both GRI Mech 3.0 and a more recent model of Wang et al., are shown to provide good overall agreement with all of the experimental data, as well as suggesting key processes of O atom generation and decay.},

 abstract = {CO/N2, CO/Ar/O2, and CO/N2/O2 gas mixtures are optically pumped using a continuous wave CO laser. Carbon monoxide molecules absorb the laser radiation and transfer energy to nitrogen and oxygen by vibration–vibration energy exchange. Infrared emission and spontaneous Raman spectroscopy are used for diagnostics of optically pumped gases. The experiments demonstrate that strong vibrational disequilibrium can be sustained in diatomic gas mixtures at pressures up to 1 atm, with only a few Watts laser power available. At these conditions, measured first level vibrational temperatures of diatomic species are in the range TV=1900–2300 K for N2, TV=2600–3800 K for CO, and TV=2200–2800 K for O2. The translational–rotational temperature of the gases does not exceed T=700 K. Line-of-sight averaged CO vibrational level populations up to v=40 are inferred from infrared emission spectra. Vibrational level populations of CO (v=0–8), N2 (v=0–4), and O2 (v=0–8) near the axis of the focused CO laser beam are inferred from the Raman spectra of these species. The results demonstrate a possibility of sustaining stable nonequilibrium plasmas in atmospheric pressure air seeded with a few percent of carbon monoxide. The obtained experimental data are compared with modeling calculations that incorporate both major processes of molecular energy transfer and diffusion of vibrationally excited species across the spatially nonuniform excitation region, showing reasonably good agreement.},

Spectra are processed to infer rotational/translational (Trot) and first-level vibrational (Tvib) temperatures in the 200–370 torr plenum simultaneously. Operation of the nominally high reduced electric field (E/npeak ~ 500 Td), nsec pulsed discharge alone results in fairly significant vibrational loading, Tvib ~ 720 K/Trot ~ 380 K; addition of an orthogonal low E/n (~10 Td) DC sustainer discharge produces substantial vibrational loading, Tvib ~ 2,000 K/Trot ~ 450 K. Effects of injection of CO2, NO, and H2 downstream of the pulser–sustainer discharge are examined, which result in vibrational relaxation accompanied by simultaneous gas heating, Tvib ~ 800–1,000 K/Trot ~ 600 K. CARSk measurements within very low-density flows in the Mach 5 expansion nozzle are also performed, with Tvib measured in both the supersonic free-stream and downstream of a bow shock created by a 5-mm-diameter cylindrical test object in the Mach 5 flow. Measurements within 300 μm of the cylinder leading edge show that for pure N2, or N2 with 0.25 torr CO2 injection, no vibrational relaxation is observed behind the bow shock.},

 abstract = {In the present study, a plasma flow reactor (PFR) facility designed to perform both ex situ and in situ experiments of stable (H2 and O2) and intermediate (OH radicals) species detection was used to examine the plasma-assisted characteristics of hydrogen oxidation at 1 atm pressure for temperatures ranging from 420 K to 1100 K. Experiments were performed at nearly isothermal conditions, by heavily diluting reactive mixtures in argon, in an attempt to mitigate temperature changes from exothermic chemical reactions. This technique allows experimental results to be interpreted from a perspective that plasma and thermal (neutral) heat release effects are decoupled, essentially isolating the effects of the plasma-chemistry and its influence on the neutral-chemistry. Results showed no thermal reaction until 860 K, at which point hydrogen was rapidly consumed within the flow residence time associated with the reactor. With the plasma discharge, the onset of oxidation was extended to lower temperatures (T < 860 K), while exhibiting a steady increase in the rate of oxidation starting from 470 K, and eventually consuming all the initial hydrogen by 800 K. Absolute measurements of OH mole fraction reveal that at conditions well below the dominance of the thermal chain-branched chemistry (at T = 668 K), the plasma induced a chain-propagating effect on OH formation, which was entirely confined to the boundaries of the plasma discharge section of the reactor. Furthermore, temporal measurements were also performed, showing that the extent of OH formation and subsequently its global effect on the fuel consuming chemistry can be manipulated based on the plasma perturbation timescale (i.e., the time scale at which the high-voltage pulses are administered to the reactive flow to generate the plasma discharge). Experimental results are compared to modeling calculations and show relatively good agreement, with the model predicting similar kinetic trends as a function of temperature. These results demonstrate new insight into the kinetics governing plasma-assisted combustion, and provide new experimental data to facilitate the development and validation of PAC-specific kinetic mechanisms.},

 abstract = {Pure rotational CARS thermometry, complemented by UV emission measurements and ICCD imaging, is used to study kinetics of low temperature plasma assisted fuel oxidation and ignition in a repetitive nanosecond pulse discharge in hydrogen-air mixtures, with number of pulses in a 40kHz burst varying from a few to a few hundred. Time-resolved OH emission, coupled with gated ICCD images of the plasma and the flame, demonstrate that volumetric ignition of H2–air mixtures occurs in a spatially uniform plasma. The results are shown to agree well with predictions of a new hydrogen-air plasma chemistry model, which incorporates non-equilibrium plasma processes, H2–air chemistry, non-empirical scaling of nanosecond pulse energy coupled to the plasma, and quasi-one-dimensional conduction heat transfer. In particular, the results demonstrate that the heating rate in low temperature hydrogen-air plasmas is much faster than in air plasmas, primarily due to energy release from exothermic reactions of fuel with O and H atoms generated in the plasma. Kinetic sensitivity analysis is used to identify dominant plasma and chemical processes of hydrogen oxidation, demonstrating that additional heat release in these reactions is a key factor in ignition kinetics. Kinetic modeling calculations demonstrate that removal of the radical generation processes by the nanosecond pulsed plasma from the model completely blocks subsequent exothermic chemical reactions, thus making ignition impossible.},

 abstract = {The paper presents results of plasma assisted combustion experiments in premixed hydrocarbon–air flows excited by a low-temperature transverse repetitively pulsed discharge plasma. The experiments have been conducted in methane–air and ethylene–air flows in a wide range of equivalence ratios, flow velocities, and pressures. The plasma was generated by a sequence of high-voltage (∼10kV), short pulse duration (∼50ns), high repetition rate (up to 50kHz) pulses. The high reduced electric field during the pulse allows efficient electronic excitation and molecular dissociation. On the other hand, the extremely low duty cycle of the repetitively pulsed discharge, ∼1/500, greatly improves the discharge stability and helps sustaining diffuse and uniform nonequilibrium plasma. Generating this repetitively pulsed plasma in premixed hydrocarbon–air flows results in ignition and flameholding, occurring at low plasma temperatures, 140–300°C, inferred from the nitrogen second positive band system spectra. At these conditions, the reacted fuel fraction, measured by the FTIR absorption spectroscopy, is up to 80%. The experiments demonstrate significant methane and ethylene conversion into CO, CO2, and H2O even at the conditions when there is no flame detected in the test section. At these conditions, fuel oxidation occurs due to plasma chemical reactions, without ignition. This provides additional evidence for the nonthermal fuel oxidation triggered by plasma-generated radicals.},

@article{pub.1020656090,
 abstract = {The paper reviews recent progress in two rapidly developing engineering applications of plasmas, plasma assisted combustion and plasma assisted high-speed flow control. Experimental and kinetic modeling results demonstrate the key role of non-thermal plasma chemistry in hydrocarbon ignition by uniform, repetitively pulsed, nanosecond pulse duration, low-temperature plasmas. Ignition delay time in premixed ethylene–air flows excited by the plasma has been measured in a wide range of pulse repetition rates and equivalence ratios and compared with kinetic modeling calculations, showing good agreement. Comparing ignition delay time predicted by the model for plasma assisted ignition and for ignition by equilibrium heating demonstrated that chain reactions of radicals generated by the plasma reduce ignition time by up to two orders of magnitude and ignition temperature by up to 300 K. These results provide additional evidence of the non-thermal nature of low-temperature plasma assisted ignition.Experiments and flow modeling show that the dominant mechanism of high-speed plasma flow control is thermal, due to heating of the flow by the plasma. Development and characterization of pulsed dc and pulsed RF localized arc filament plasma actuator arrays for control of high-speed atmospheric pressure jet flows are discussed. Actuator power is quite low, ~10 W at 10% duty cycle. Plasma emission spectra show that a greater fraction of the pulsed RF discharge power goes to heat the flow (up to 2500 °C), while a significant fraction of the pulsed dc discharge power is spent on electrode and wall heating, resulting in their erosion. Rapid localized heating of the flow by the pulsed arc filaments, at a rate of ~1000 K/10 µs, results in the formation of strong compression/shock waves, detected by schlieren imaging. Effect of flow forcing by repetitively pulsed RF actuators is demonstrated in a M = 1.3 axisymmetric jet. These two case studies provide illustrative examples of isolating non-thermal (non-equilibrium plasma chemistry) and thermal (Joule heating) effects in plasmas and adapting them to develop efficient large-volume plasma igniters and high-speed flow actuators.},

 abstract = { The kinetics of plasma-assisted pyrolysis and oxidation of ethylene have been numerically investigated. Combining plasma chemistry processes including electron-impact reactions, and reactions of electronically excited species with a comprehensive combustion mechanism, a plasma-assisted kinetic mechanism of ethylene pyrolysis and oxidation has been constructed. To test the accuracy of the constructed mechanism, numerical results were compared to experimental data obtained in a plasma flow reactor, performed under highly diluted conditions in argon at a pressure of 1atm for temperatures ranging from 520K to 1250K. Comparison of plasma-assisted pyrolysis results indicates little discrepancy between the model and experiments. Direct collisional quenching of electronically excited argon by ethylene is responsible for the low temperature enhancement of fuel consumption seen in the plasma-assisted pyrolysis experiments. Hydrocarbon radicals generally undergo addition and recombination reactions to yield several C3 and C4 hydrocarbon intermediates. As temperature increases, the plasma effects diminish and the reaction is overtaken by thermal pyrolysis. Comparison of experimental and modeling results for plasma-assisted oxidation of ethylene demonstrated relatively good agreement for most major and minor species. However, poor agreement was found for ethylene and acetaldehyde for T < 750K. In the oxidation system, collisional quenching of excited argon by O2 to generate the O-atom radical pool complemented the plasma-specific fuel dissociation reactions. The plasma was found to have different effects on the oxidation kinetics at different temperatures. At low temperatures, R+O2 type chemistry (R being a hydrocarbon radical) facilitates the formation of oxygenated species to enhance oxidation by way of formaldehyde. At intermediate temperatures, the formation of hydrocarbon and alcohol intermediates slows the oxidation process relative to the low temperatures. Finally, at high temperatures, plasma chemical reactions are unable to compete against the high temperature chain-branching reactions of the neutral chemistry that dominate and control the overall oxidation process.},

 abstract = {Singlet delta oxygen (SDO) yield, small signal gain, and output power have been measured in a scaled electric discharge excited oxygen?iodine laser. Two different types of discharges have been used for SDO generation in O2?He?NO flows at pressures up to 90?Torr, crossed nanosecond pulser/dc sustainer discharge and capacitively coupled transverse RF discharge. The total flow rate through the laser cavity with a 10?cm gain path is approximately 0.5?mole?s?1, with steady-state run time at a near-design Mach number of M = 2.9 of up to 5?s. The results demonstrate that SDO yields and flow temperatures obtained using the pulser-sustainer and the RF discharges are close. Gain and static temperature in the supersonic cavity remain nearly constant, ? = 0.10?0.12%?cm?1 and T = 125?140?K, over the axial distance of approximately 10?cm. The highest gain measured is 0.122%?cm?1 at T = 140?K. Positive gain measured in the supersonic inviscid core extends over approximately one half to one third of the cavity height, with absorption measured in the boundary layers near top and bottom walls of the cavity. Laser power has been measured using (i) two 99.9% mirrors on both sides of the resonator, 2.5?W, and (ii) 99.9% mirror on one side and 99% mirror on the other side, 3.1?W. Gain downstream of the resonator is moderately reduced during lasing (by up to 20?30%) and remains nearly independent of the axial distance, by up to 10?cm. This suggests that only a small fraction of power available for lasing is coupled out, and that additional power may be coupled in a second resonator. Preliminary laser power measurements using two transverse resonators operating at the same time (both using 99.9?99% mirror combinations) demonstrated lasing at both axial locations, with the total power of 3.8?W.},

@article{pub.1027496272,
 abstract = {The paper presents results of plasma assisted combustion experiments using high-voltage, nanosecond pulse duration, high pulse repetition rate discharge and kinetic modeling calculations. In the experiments, two different operation regimes have been identified, (i) oxidation regime with relatively low fuel fractions oxidized in the absence of visible flame, and (ii) ignition regime, with large fuel fraction burned, large amounts of CO and CO2 generated, and flame detected in the reactor. Ignition occurred at air flow temperatures as low as 300°C (before adding fuel). In both regimes, significant plasma temperature rise is detected in air–fuel flows, up to ΔT=300°C. Comparing these results with temperatures and dissociated fuel fractions in nitrogen–fuel flows demonstrates that the temperature rise in air–fuel flows is due to exothermic plasma chemical fuel oxidation process, which results in ignition when the flow temperature approaches autoignition temperature. This conclusion was confirmed by kinetic modeling calculations, which also demonstrated that ignition temperature is significantly reduced by the presence of radicals in the flow. Calculations showed that the model correctly predicts oxidized fuel fractions and resultant temperature rise in the plasma in the oxidation regime but significantly overpredicts burned fuel fractions in the ignition regime. Transition from the oxidation to the ignition regime predicted by the model is consistent with the experiment. Finally, the model poorly predicts some product species concentrations (CO2, CH2O, and C2H2), even in the oxidation regime. Comparison of product species concentrations predicted utilizing two widely used hydrocarbon reaction mechanisms showed significant differences. Since these mechanisms have not been validated at near-room temperatures, this suggests that they may be inapplicable at the present conditions. This demonstrates the need for development of an accurate low-temperature plasma chemical fuel oxidation reaction mechanism.},

The fluorescence in the infrared and in the ultraviolet is analyzed under steady-state pumping conditions. Quantitative analysis of the NO IR overtone spectrum, Δv=2, allows inference of the vibrational distribution function of the X 2Π ground state up to vibrational level v=15. It is shown that the mechanism of vibrational excitation is anharmonic vibration-vibration pumping. In particular, the higher vibrational levels, v⩾8, are populated by near-resonant vibration-to-vibration exchange processes. It is suggested that the electronically excited NO molecules in A 2Σ and B 2Π states, which are observed, can be produced both by resonant vibration-to-electronic energy transfer processes and in energy pooling reactions. Previous rate measurement experiments in NO are analyzed and discussed in light of the present data, and further state-resolved measurements are proposed.},

 abstract = {The effect of ns discharge pulses on the AC barrier discharge in hydrogen in plane-to-plane geometry is studied using time-resolved measurements of the electric field in the plasma. The AC discharge was operated at a pressure of 300 Torr at frequencies of 500 and 1750 Hz, with ns pulses generated when the AC voltage was near zero. The electric field vector is measured by ps four-wave mixing technique, which generates coherent IR signal proportional to the square of electric field. Absolute calibration was done using an electrostatic (sub-breakdown) field applied to the discharge electrodes, when no plasma was generated. The results are compared with one-dimensional kinetic modeling of the AC discharge and the nanosecond pulse discharge, predicting behavior of both individual micro-discharges and their cumulative effect on the electric field distribution in the electrode gap, using stochastic averaging based on the experimental micro-discharge temporal probability distribution during the AC period. Time evolution of the electric field in the AC discharge without ns pulses, controlled by a superposition of random micro-discharges, exhibits a nearly 'flat top' distribution with the maximum near breakdown threshold, reproduced quite well by kinetic modeling. Adding ns pulse discharges on top of the AC voltage waveform changes the AC discharge behavior in a dramatic way, inducing transition from random micro-discharges to a more regular, near-1D discharge. In this case, reproducible volumetric AC breakdown is produced at a well-defined moment after each ns pulse discharge. During the reproducible AC breakdown, the electric field in the plasma exhibits a sudden drop, which coincides in time with a well-defined current pulse. This trend is also predicted by the kinetic model. Analysis of kinetic modeling predictions shows that this effect is caused by large-volume ionization and neutralization of surface charges on the dielectrics by ns discharge pulses. The present work demonstrates that this effect may be used to control the phase of AC barrier discharges, triggering reproducible breakdowns at well-defined moments.},

 abstract = {The paper presents the results of an experimental study of supersonic combustor operation enhanced by an electrical discharge. A novel scheme of plasma assisted ignition and flameholding is demonstrated, which combines a wall fuel injector and a high-voltage electric discharge into a single module. The experimental combustor with the cross section of 72mm (width)×60mm (height) and length of 600mm operates at a Mach number of M=2, initial stagnation temperature of airflow of T0=290–300K, and stagnation pressure of P0=1.3–2.0Bar. The combustor is equipped with four plasma ignition modules, flush-mounted side-by-side on the plane wall of the combustion chamber. The combustion tests were performed using ethylene injection with a total mass flow rate of GC2H4<10g/s and discharge power in the range of Wpl=3–24kW. The scope of the experiments includes characterization of the discharge interacting with the main flow and fuel injection jet, parametric study of ignition and flame front dynamics, and comparison of the present scheme to previously tested configuration. The present approach demonstrates a significant advantage in terms of flameholding limits. An operation mode with strong combustion oscillations was observed at high fuel injection flow rates. Methods of flame front stabilization based on plasma application are discussed. The technique studied in the present work has significant potential for high-speed combustion applications, including cold start/restart of scramjet engines and support of transition regime in dual-mode and off-design operation.},

 abstract = {The paper discusses experimental characterization of a surface dielectric barrier discharge plasma sustained by repetitive, high-voltage, nanosecond duration pulses. The discharge pulse energy is controlled primarily by the pulse peak voltage and scales approximately linearly with the length of the electrodes. Images of the plasma generated during the discharge pulse, taken by a nanosecond gate ICCD camera, show that the plasma remains fairly uniform in the initial phase of the discharge and becomes filamentary at a later stage. The temperature rise in the discharge, operated in both continuous mode and in burst mode, is inferred from UV/visible emission spectra. Phase-locked schlieren images are used to measure the speed of the compression waves generated by the nanosecond pulse discharge and the density gradient in the wave. The density gradient is inferred from the schlieren images using absolute calibration by a pair of wedged windows. The results demonstrate that discharge filaments generate compression waves with higher amplitude and higher speed compared with waves produced in a diffuse discharge. The density gradient in the compression waves is compared with numerical modeling of propagating compression waves produced by short-pulse localized heating, and shows satisfactory agreement between the model and the experimental results.},

 abstract = {The paper discusses measurements of vibration-to-vibration (V–V) energy transfer rates for CO–CO using time-resolved step-scan Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of optically pumped carbon monoxide. In the experiments, time evolution of all vibrational states of carbon monoxide excited by a CO laser and populated by V–V processes (up to v∼40) is monitored simultaneously. The V–V rates are inferred from these data using a kinetic model that incorporates spatial power distribution of the focused laser beam, transport processes, and multi-quantum V–V processes. Although the model predictions agree well with the time-dependent step-scan relaxation data, there is variance between the model predictions and the up-pumping data, however. Comparison of calculations using two different sets of V–V rates with experimental spectra showed that the use of the semi-empirical V–V rates of DeLeon and Rich provides better agreement with experiment. It is also shown that the multi-quantum V–V rates among high vibrational quantum numbers, calculated by Cacciatore and Billing, are substantially overpredicted. The results provide some new insight into nonequilibrium vibrational kinetics, and also demonstrate the capabilities of the step-scan Fourier transform spectroscopy for time-resolved studies of molecular energy transfer processes and validation of theoretical rate models.},

The analysis shows that non-self-sustained dc and RF discharges can be successfully used for measurements of the electron production rate, electron recombination rate, and electron density in these plasmas. The inferred rate of electron production per unit volume by the associative ionization mechanism is S0 = 1.0×1015 cm-3 s-1 and S0 = 2.2×1014 cm-3 s-1 in CO/Ar = 2/100 and in CO/N2 = 2/100 plasmas, respectively.

In CO/Ar = 2/100 mixtures with a 0.05-0.1 Torr admixture of O2 at P = 100 Torr and 20 Torr, the inferred recombination rate coefficients are β = (1.5±0.3)×10-8 cm3 s-1 and β = (5.1±2.9)×10-8 cm3 s-1, respectively. Finally, the inferred electron density in optically-pumped CO/Ar/O2 plasmas at the laser beam axis is ne = (1.7±0.2)×1011 cm-3 at P = 100 Torr and ne = (6.2±0.8)×1010 cm-3 at P = 20 Torr. These results demonstrate that the electron density in optically-pumped CO/Ar plasmas can be controlled and significantly increased by adding small amounts (up to ~0.1%) of species such as O2 and NO, which result in the reduction of the electron-ion recombination rate.},

Peak temperature in the discharge and the afterglow is low, T ≈ 370 K, in spite of significant vibrational nonequilibrium, with peak N2 vibrational temperature of Tv ≈ 2000 K. Significant vibrational temperature rise in the afterglow is likely caused by the downward N2–N2 vibration–vibration (V–V) energy transfer. Simple kinetic modeling of time-resolved N, O, and NO number densities in the afterglow, on the time scale longer compared to relaxation and quenching time of excited species generated in the plasma, is in good agreement with the data. In nitrogen, the N atom density after the discharge pulse is controlled by three-body recombination and radial diffusion. In air, N, NO and O concentrations are dominated by the reverse Zel'dovich reaction, N + NO → N2 + O, and ozone formation reaction, O + O2 + M → O3 + M, respectively. The effect of vibrationally excited nitrogen molecules and excited N atoms on NO formation kinetics is estimated to be negligible. The results suggest that NO formation in the nanosecond pulse discharge is dominated by reactions of excited electronic states of nitrogen, occurring on microsecond time scale.},

Some of the attributes that would make an actuator suitable for such flows are: high amplitude and bandwidth; small size for distribution around the jet; phase-locking ability for jet azimuthal mode forcing; and sufficient ruggedness for hot jets. We have been developing a class of actuators termed ‘localized arc filament plasma actuators,’ which possess such characteristics. In this paper, we present the development and characterization of these actuators as well as preliminary results on their applications in high Reynolds number Mach 0.9 and ideally expanded Mach 1.3 jets.},

@article{pub.1036381189,
 abstract = {The paper discusses experiments on vibration-to-electronic energy transfer in CO laser pumped CO–Ar and CO–N2 plasmas. Ionization in these strongly nonequilibrium plasmas occurs by an associative mechanism, in collisions of two highly vibrationally excited CO molecules. The experiments show that removal of the electrons from the optically pumped plasmas using a saturated Thomson discharge results in considerable reduction of the UV/visible radiation from the plasma (CO 4th positive bands, NO γ bands, CN violet bands, and C2 Swan bands). At some conditions, the removal of electrons results in a nearly complete extinguishing of the UV/visible glow of the plasma. This effect occurs even though electron removal results in an increase of the high vibrational level populations of the ground electronic state CO(X1Σ, v∼15–35). On the other hand, deliberate electron density increase by adding small amounts of O2 or NO to the optically pumped CO–Ar plasmas produced a substantial increase of the UV/visible radiation intensity, which strongly correlates with the electron density. The results of the present experiments indicate that the vibration-to-electronic (V–E) energy transfer process CO(X1Σ→A1Π), and, possibly, analogous processes populating radiating excited electronic states of NO, CN, and C2, in optically pumped plasmas, may be mediated by the presence of electrons which are created in the absence of an electric field, with low initial energies. Most importantly, this effect occurs at ionization fractions as low as ne/N∼10−9–10−7.},

The model is based on analysis of semiclassical trajectories of rotating molecules interacting by a repulsive exponential atom-to-atom potential. The model predictions are compared with the results of three-dimensional close-coupled semiclassical trajectory calculations using the same potential energy surface. The comparison demonstrates good agreement between analytic and numerical probabilities of rotational and vibrational energy transfer processes, over a wide range of total collision energies, rotational energies, and impact parameter. The model predicts probabilities of single-quantum and multi-quantum vibrational-rotational transitions and is applicable up to very high collision energies and quantum numbers. Closed-form analytic expressions for these transition probabilities lend themselves to straightforward incorporation into DSMC nonequilibrium flow codes.},

@article{pub.1036742813,
 abstract = {The paper discusses recent results on the development of localized arc filament plasma actuators and their use in controlling high-speed and high Reynolds number jet flows. Multiple plasma actuators (up to 8) are controlled using a custom-built 8-channel high-voltage pulsed plasma generator. The plasma generator independently controls pulse repetition rate (0–200 kHz), duty cycle and phase for each individual actuator. Current and voltage measurements demonstrated the power consumption of each actuator to be quite low (20 W at 20% duty cycle). Emission spectroscopy temperature measurements in the pulsed arc filament showed rapid temperature increase over the first 10–20 µs of arc operation, from below 1000 °C to up to about 2000 °C. At longer discharge pulse durations, 20–100 µs, the plasma temperature levels off at approximately 2000 °C.Modelling calculations using an unsteady, quasi-one-dimensional arc filament model showed that rapid localized heating in the arc filament on a microsecond time scale generates strong compression waves. The results of the calculations also suggest that flow forcing is most efficient at low actuator duty cycles, with short heating periods and sufficiently long delays between the pulses to allow for convective cooling of high-temperature filaments. The model predictions are consistent with laser sheet scattering flow visualization results and particle imaging velocimetry measurements. These measurements show large-scale coherent structure formation and considerable mixing enhancement in an ideally expanded Mach 1.3 jet forced by eight repetitively pulsed plasma actuators. The effects of forcing are most significant near the jet preferred mode frequency (ν = 5 kHz). The results also show a substantial reduction in the jet potential core length and a significant increase in the jet Mach number decay rate beyond the end of potential core, especially at low actuator duty cycles.},

 abstract = {We present a new set of V–V rate coefficients for vibrational levels 0–5 in H2 at 300K, measured using a stimulated Raman–spontaneous Raman pump/probe apparatus. The measured rate of the non-resonant process, H2(v=1)+H2(v=1)→H2(v=0)+H2(v=2), is consistent with the previously reported experimental value of Kreutz et al. However, semi-classical predictions of such non-resonant processes, using the identical inter-molecular potential and methodology to that given by Cacciatore and Billing, results in rates which are too slow, by a factor of approximately 3. For the “resonant” V–V process, H2(v=1)+H2(v=0)→H2(v=0)+H2(v=1), the semi-classical rate is found to be too slow by an even larger factor, of approximately 30, compared to the experimental rate, but consistent with the previously reported experimental result of Farrow and Chandler. Further, unlike the semi-classical model prediction in which the (1,1→2,0) process rate is predicted to exceed that of the (1,0→0,1) process, the experimental data shows it to be a factor of approximately 2.5 less, suggesting that semi-classical methods that treat the rotational motion classically are unsuitable for the highly anharmonic H2 molecule. The ratio of pure rotation and rotation–vibration Raman cross sections for scattering from levels 0 and 1 is also determined, with results which agree with calculations of Schwartz and LeRoy, but are somewhat larger than previous experimental results of Cureton.},

 abstract = {This paper presents results of singlet oxygen generation experiments in a high-pressure, non-self-sustained crossed discharge. The discharge consists of a high-voltage, short pulse duration, high repetition rate pulsed discharge, which produces ionization in the flow, and a low-voltage dc discharge which sustains current in a decaying plasma between the pulses. The sustainer voltage can be independently varied to maximize the energy input into electron impact excitation of singlet delta oxygen (SDO). The results demonstrate operation of a stable and diffuse crossed discharge in O2–He mixtures at static pressures of at least up to P0 = 380 Torr and sustainer discharge powers of at least up to 1200 W, achieved at P0 = 120 Torr. The reduced electric field in the positive column of the sustainer discharge varies from E/N = 0.3 × 10−16 to 0.65 × 10−16 V cm2, which is significantly lower than E/N in self-sustained discharges and close to the theoretically predicted optimum value for O2(a 1Δ) excitation. Measurements of visible emission spectra O2(b 1Σ → X 3Σ) in the discharge afterglow show the O2(b 1Σ) concentration to increase with the sustainer discharge power and to decrease as the O2 fraction in the flow is increased. Rotational temperatures inferred from these spectra in 10% O2–90% He flows at P0 = 120 Torr and mass flow rates of  are 365–465 K. SDO yield at these conditions, 1.7% to 4.4%, was inferred from the integrated intensity of the (0, 0) band of the O2(a 1Δ → X 3Σ) infrared emission spectra calibrated using a blackbody source. The yield remains nearly constant in the discharge afterglow, up to at least 15 cm distance from the discharge. Kinetic modelling calculations using a quasi-one-dimensional nonequilibrium pulser–sustainer discharge model coupled with the Boltzmann equation for plasma electrons predict gas temperature rise in the discharge in satisfactory agreement with the experimental measurements. However, the model overpredicts the O2(a 1Δ) yield by a factor of 2–2.5, which suggests that the model's description of nonequilibrium O2–He plasma kinetics at high pressures is not quite adequate.},

 abstract = {The main focus of the review is on dynamics and kinetics of near-surface discharge plasmas, such as surface dielectric barrier discharges sustained by AC and repetitively pulsed waveforms, pulsed DC discharges, and quasi-DC discharges, generated in quiescent air and in the airflow. A number of technical issues related to plasma flow control applications are discussed in detail, including discharge development via surface ionization waves, charge transport and accumulation on dielectric surface, discharge contraction, different types of flow perturbations generated by surface discharges, and effect of high-speed flow on discharge dynamics. In the first part of the manuscript, plasma morphology and results of electrical and optical emission spectroscopy measurements are discussed. Particular attention is paid to dynamics of surface charge accumulation and dissipation, both in diffuse discharges and during development of ionization instabilities resulting in discharge contraction. Contraction leads to significant increase of both the surface area of charge accumulation and the energy coupled to the plasma. The use of alternating polarity pulse waveforms accelerates contraction of surface dielectric barrier discharges and formation of filamentary plasmas. The second part discusses the interaction of discharge plasmas with quiescent air and the external airflow. Four major types of flow perturbations have been identified: (1) low-speed near-surface jets generated by electrohydrodynamic interaction (ion wind); (2) spanwise and streamwise vortices formed by both electrohydrodynamic and thermal effects; (3) weak shock waves produced by rapid heating in pulsed discharges on sub-microsecond time scale; and (4) near-surface localized stochastic perturbations, on sub-millisecond time, detected only recently. The mechanism of plasma-flow interaction remains not fully understood, especially in filamentary surface dielectric barrier discharges. Localized quasi-DC surface discharges sustained in a high-speed flow are discussed in the third part of the review. Although dynamics of this type of the discharge is highly transient, due to its strong interaction with the flow, the resultant flow structure is stationary, including the oblique shock and the flow separation region downstream of the discharge. The oblique shock is attached to a time-averaged, wedge-shaped, near-wall plasma layer, with the shock angle controlled by the discharge power, which makes possible changing the flow structure and parameters in a controlled way. Finally, unresolved and open-ended issues are discussed in the summary.},

A brief review of the theoretical background of CARS, four-wave mixing and Raman scattering, as well as a discussion of experimental techniques and data reduction, are included. The experimental results reviewed include measurements of vibrational level populations, rotational/translational temperature, electric fields in a quasi-steady-state and transient molecular plasmas and afterglow, in nonequilibrium expansion flows, and behind strong shock waves. Insight into the kinetics of vibrational energy transfer, energy thermalization mechanisms and dynamics of the pulse discharge development, provided by these experiments, is discussed. Availability of short pulse duration, high peak power lasers, as well as broadband dye lasers, makes possible the use of these diagnostics at relatively low pressures, potentially with a sub-nanosecond time resolution, as well as obtaining single laser shot, high signal-to-noise spectra at higher pressures. Possibilities for the development of single-shot 2D CARS imaging and spectroscopy, using picosecond and femtosecond lasers, as well as novel phase matching and detection techniques, are discussed.},

 abstract = {Control of flow separation from the deflected flap of a high-lift airfoil up to Reynolds numbers of 240,000 (15 m/s) is explored using a single dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuator near the flap shoulder. Results show that the plasma discharge can increase or reduce the size of the time-averaged separated region over the flap depending on the frequency of actuation. High-frequency actuation, referred to here as quasi-steady forcing, slightly delays separation while lengthening and flattening the separated region without drastically increasing the measured lift. The actuator is found to be most effective for increasing lift when operated in an unsteady fashion at the natural oscillation frequency of the trailing edge flow field. Results indicate that the primary control mechanism in this configuration is an enhancement of the natural vortex shedding that promotes further momentum transfer between the freestream and separated region. Based on these results, different modulation waveforms for creating unsteady DBD plasma-induced flows are investigated in an effort to improve control authority. Subsequent measurements show that modulation using duty cycles of 50–70% generates stronger velocity perturbations than sinusoidal modulation in quiescent conditions at the expense of an increased power requirement. Investigation of these modulation waveforms for trailing edge separation control similarly shows that additional increases in lift can be obtained. The dependence of these results on the actuator carrier and modulation frequencies is discussed in detail.},

 abstract = {The paper presents results of a high-pressure, non-self-sustained crossed discharge–M = 3 supersonic laser cavity operation. A stable and diffuse pulser–sustainer discharge in O2–He flows is generated at pressures of up to P0 = 120 Torr and discharge powers of up to 2.1 kW. The reduced electric field in the dc sustainer discharge ranges from 0.6 × 10−16 to 1.2 × 10−16 V cm2. Singlet delta oxygen (SDO) yield in the discharge, up to 5.0–5.7% at the flow temperatures of 400-420 K, was inferred from the integrated intensity of the (0, 0) band of the O2(a 1Δ → X 3Σ) infrared emission spectra calibrated using a blackbody source. The yield increases with the discharge power and remains nearly independent of the O2 fraction in the mixture (in the 10–20% range). Static pressure and temperature measurements in the supersonic cavity show that a steady-state M = 3 flow in the cavity can be sustained for up to 20 s, at the flow temperature of T = 120 ± 15 K. The results suggest that the measured SDO yield exceeds the threshold yield at the cavity temperature by up to a factor of 2.5. PLIF iodine vapour visualization in the supersonic cavity, which showed the presence of large-scale structures, suggests the need to improve iodine vapour mixing with the main oxygen–helium flow.},

 abstract = {Laser induced fluorescence is used to measure absolute nitric oxide concentrations in air, methane–air and ethylene–air non-equilibrium plasmas, as a function of time after initiation of a single pulse, 20 kV peak voltage, 25 ns pulse duration discharge. A mixture of NO and nitrogen with known composition (4.18 ppm NO) is used for calibration. Peak NO density in air at 60 Torr, after a single pulse, is ~8 × 1012 cm−3 (~4.14 ppm) occurring at ~250 µs after the pulse, with decay time of ~16.5 ms. Peak NO atom mole fraction in a methane–air mixture with equivalence ratio of  = 0.5 is found to be approximately equal to that in air, with approximately the same rise and decay rate. In an ethylene–air mixture (also with equivalence ratio of  = 0.5), the rise and decay times are comparable to air and methane–air, but the peak NO concentration is reduced by a factor of approximately 2.5. Spontaneous emission measurements show that excited electronic states N2(C 3Π) and NO(A 2Σ) in air at P = 60 Torr decay within ~20 ns and ~1 µs, respectively. Kinetic modelling calculations incorporating air plasma kinetics complemented with the GRI Mech 3.0 hydrocarbon oxidation mechanism are compared with the experimental data using three different NO production mechanisms. It is found that NO concentration rise after the discharge pulse is much faster than predicted by Zel'dovich mechanism reactions, by two orders of magnitude, but much slower compared with reactions of electronically excited nitrogen atoms and molecules, also by two orders of magnitude. It is concluded that processes involving long lifetime (~100 µs) metastable states, such as N2(X 1Σ,v) and O2(b 1Σ), formed by quenching of the metastable N2(A 3Σ) state by ground electronic state O2, may play a dominant role in NO formation. NO decay, in all cases, is found to be dominated by the reverse Zel'dovich reaction, NO + O → N + O2, as well as by conversion into NO2 in a reaction of NO with ozone.},

 abstract = {The paper presents experiments characterizing discharge development and energy coupling in a surface dielectric barrier discharge (SDBD), atmospheric air plasmas over dielectric and weakly conducting surfaces, over a wide range of time scales and electrical conductivities. The experiments are done using nanosecond pulse (NS) both single polarity and alternating polarity) and ac voltage waveforms. Discharge development and mechanisms of coupling with quiescent air are analysed using nanosecond gate camera imaging, schlieren imaging, and laser differential interferometry. It is shown that NS SDBD plasmas generate stochastic, localized, near-surface perturbations on a long time scale (>100 μs) after the discharge pulse. These perturbations, entirely different from compression waves generated on a short time scale (~1–10 μs), are caused by discharge contraction and originate from the ends of the filaments. Surface conductivity has almost no effect on discharge behaviour if RC time of the conducting surface layer is much longer compared to the characteristic time of NS or ac voltage waveforms. In the opposite limit of short RC time, the conducting layer acts as an extension of the high-voltage electrode. Discharge contraction significantly increases energy stored on the dielectric surface, which in this case exceeds energy dissipated as Joule heat. The stored energy is dissipated if the discharge pulse is followed by an opposite polarity pulse. In a single polarity discharge, on the other hand, surface charge accumulation limits energy coupled to the plasma by subsequent pulses. The results demonstrate that surface plasma actuator control authority may be significantly increased by using an alternating polarity pulse waveform, which is more effective than the removal of surface charge between the pulses using a weakly conducting surface.},

 abstract = {Temperatures and vibrational populations are investigated experimentally and numerically in a CO–N2–O2 gas mixture. By spatially resolved Raman Q-branch spectra measurement, the strong vibrational excitation was observed in the gas mixtures at a high gas pressure. Numerical calculation, which incorporates both major processes of molecular energy transfer and diffusion of vibrationally excited species across the spatially nonuniform excitation region, provides indepth perception of vibrational kinetics of these diatomic molecular gas mixtures and is verified by the experimental data. The results demonstrate that strong vibrational nonequilibrium for all diatomic species can be sustained by the optical pumping method with a focused CO laser in a relatively cold (300–400 K) molecular gas mixture up to one atmospheric pressure. However, the results also demand further investigations on determining accurate rates of the V–V exchange gas mixture such as for N2–O2.},

 abstract = {Recently developed localized arc filament plasma actuators (LAFPAs) have shown tremendous control authority in high-speed and high Reynolds number flow for mixing enhancement and noise mitigation. Previously, these actuators were powered by a high-voltage pulsed DC plasma generator with low energy coupling efficiency of 5–10%. In the present work, a new custom-designed 8-channel pulsed radio frequency (RF) plasma generator has been developed to power up to 8 plasma actuators operated over a wide range of forcing frequencies (up to 50 kHz) and duty cycles (1–50%), and at high energy coupling efficiency (up to 80–85%). This reduces input electrical power requirements by approximately an order of magnitude, down to 12 W per actuator operating at 10% duty cycle. The new pulsed RF plasma generator is scalable to a system with a large number of channels. Performance of pulsed RF plasma actuators used for flow control was studied in a Mach 0.9 circular jet with a Reynolds number of about 623,000 and compared with that of pulsed DC actuators. Eight actuators were distributed uniformly on the perimeter of a 2.54-cm diameter circular nozzle extension. Both types of actuators coupled approximately the same amount of power to the flow, but with drastically different electrical inputs to the power supplies. Particle image velocimetry measurements showed that jet centerline Mach number decay produced by DC and RF actuators operating at the same forcing frequencies and duty cycles is very similar. At a forcing Strouhal number near 0.3, close to the jet column instability frequency, well-organized periodic structures, with similar patterns and dimensions, were generated in the jets forced by both DC and RF actuators. Far-field acoustic measurements demonstrated similar trends in the overall sound pressure level (OASPL) change produced by both types of actuators, resulting in OASPL reduction up to 1.2–1.5 dB in both cases. We conclude that pulsed RF actuators demonstrate flow control authority similar to pulsed DC actuators, with a significantly reduced power budget.},

 abstract = {The paper presents results of time-resolved rotational temperature measurements, by pure rotational coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy and absolute O atom number density measurements, by two-photon absorption laser induced fluorescence. The experiments were conducted in nanosecond pulse discharges in H2?O2?Ar and C2H4?O2?Ar mixtures, initially at room temperature, operated at a high pulse repetition rate of 40?kHz, in a plane-to-plane double dielectric barrier geometry at a pressure of 40 Torr. Intensified charge-coupled device images show that O2?Ar and H2?O2?Ar plasmas remain diffuse and volume-filling during the entire burst. Images taken in C2H4?O2?Ar plasma demonstrate significant discharge filamentation and constriction along the center plane and in the corners of the test section. The experimental results demonstrate high accuracy of pure rotational psec CARS for thermometry measurements at low partial pressures of oxygen in nonequilibrium plasmas. The results are compared with kinetic modeling calculations, using two different H2?O2 chemistry and C2H4?O2 chemistry mechanisms. In H2?O2?Ar mixtures, the kinetic modeling predictions are in fairly good agreement with the data, predicting temperature rise and O atom accumulation in long discharge bursts, up to 450 pulses. The results show that adding hydrogen to the mixture results in an additional temperature rise, due to its partial oxidation by radicals generated in the plasma, essentially without chain branching. In C2H4?O2?Ar mixtures, the model consistently underpredicts both temperature and O atom number density. The most likely reason for the difference between the experimental data and model predictions is discharge filamentation developing when ethylene is added to the O2?Ar mixture, at fairly low temperatures.},

Such a configuration is ideal for identifying key processes and key species that can alter fuel oxidation, hydrocarbon intermediate formation, and radical formation/heat-release under combusting conditions. Initial results using emission spectroscopy demonstrate that the excited-state species such as OH*, CH*, and are significantly enhanced in the presence of repetitive nanosecond pulse discharges. This new plasma-flame facility also lends itself to kinetic modeling due to its simple quasi-one-dimensional geometry and uniformity of the nanosecond pulse discharge.},

 abstract = {Pure rotational CARS thermometry is used to study low-temperature plasma assisted fuel oxidation kinetics in a repetitive nanosecond pulse discharge in ethene–air at stoichiometric and fuel lean conditions at 40 Torr pressure. Air and fuel–air mixtures are excited by a burst of high-voltage nanosecond pulses (peak voltage, 20 kV; pulse duration, ~ 25 ns) at a 40 kHz pulse repetition rate and a burst repetition rate of 10 Hz. The number of pulses in the burst is varied from a few pulses to a few hundred pulses. The results are compared with the previously developed hydrocarbon–air plasma chemistry model, modified to incorporate non-empirical scaling of the nanosecond discharge pulse energy coupled to the plasma with number density, as well as one-dimensional conduction heat transfer. Experimental time-resolved temperature, determined as a function of the number of pulses in the burst, is found to agree well with the model predictions. The results demonstrate that the heating rate in fuel–air plasmas is much faster compared with air plasmas, primarily due to energy release in exothermic reactions of fuel with O atoms generated by the plasma. It is found that the initial heating rate in fuel–air plasmas is controlled by the rate of radical (primarily O atoms) generation and is nearly independent of the equivalence ratio. At long burst durations, the heating rate in lean fuel air–mixtures is significantly reduced when all fuel is oxidized.},

 abstract = {The paper presents results of combustion efficiency measurements using Fourier transform infrared absorption spectroscopy in premixed hydrocarbon–air and CO–air flows excited by a low-temperature transverse radiofrequency (RF) discharge plasma. The results demonstrate that significant fractions of these fuels are burned in RF plasma-generated and -stabilized flames (up to 100% of ethylene, 70% of methane, and 40% of CO). The results also show that fuel oxidation in the RF plasma-excited flows is most efficient in lean mixtures. Measurements of reaction product concentrations in hydrocarbon–air and CO–air mixtures show that significant amounts of fuel react under conditions when there is no flame detected in the test section. Under these conditions, fuel species oxidation occurs in plasma chemical reactions, without producing ignition. Also, experiments in CO–air flows demonstrated ignition and combustion at the equivalence ratios well below the lean flammability limit for CO. Finally, experiments in higher power RF discharges (500 W) showed that nonequilibrium plasma ignition occurs at flow velocities up to at least u=60 m/s and at flow residence times exceeding ∼1 s. The effect of significant fuel oxidation, which is observed for lean fuel–air mixtures outside the flammable range, before the ignition occurs, provides additional evidence for the nonthermal fuel oxidation triggered by plasma-generated radicals. The present results, combined with previous experiments in which RF plasma ignition was demonstrated to occur in a low-temperature plasma, suggest the following nonequilibrium plasma ignition mechanism: (i) active radical species generation by the nonequilibrium plasma, (ii) plasma chemical reactions of fuel species oxidation with participation of these radicals, (iii) flow heating due to net exothermal plasma chemical fuel oxidation process, and (iv) subsequent thermal ignition and combustion.},

Carbon monoxide in the reactor is vibrationally excited by resonance absorption of the laser radiation and is vibration–vibration (V–V) pumped up to high vibrational levels. 12CO vibrational level populations and temperature in the excited region are measured by FTIR emission spectroscopy. Highly vibrationally excited CO molecules chemically react to form CO2, which at these conditions is expected to be enriched in 13C isotope.

The results show that CO2 in the products is enriched in 13C isotope, with enrichment coefficient varying from β=1.25 to 1.9, and CO2 yield varying from 70 to 170ppm.

 abstract = {Surface ionization wave discharges generated by high-voltage nanosecond pulses, propagating over a planar quartz surface and over liquid surfaces (distilled water and 1-butanol) have been studied in a rectangular cross section test cell. The discharge was initiated using a custom-made, alternating polarity, high-voltage nanosecond pulse plasma generator, operated at a pulse repetition rate of 100–500 Hz, with a pulse peak voltage and current of 10–15 kV and 7–20 A, respectively, a pulse FWHM of ∼100 ns, and a coupled pulse energy of 2–9 mJ/pulse. Wave speed was measured using a capacitive probe. ICCD camera images demonstrated that the ionization wave propagated predominantly over the quartz wall or over the liquid surface adjacent to the grounded waveguide placed along the bottom wall of the test cell. Under all experimental conditions tested, the surface plasma ‘sheet’ was diffuse and fairly uniform, both for positive and negative polarities. The parameters of ionization wave discharge propagating over distilled water and 1-butanol surfaces were close to those of the discharge over a quartz wall. No perturbation of the liquid surface by the discharge was detected. In most cases, the positive polarity surface ionization wave propagated at a higher speed and over a longer distance compared to the negative polarity wave. For all three sets of experiments (surface ionization wave discharge over quartz, water and 1-butanol), wave speed and travel distance decreased with pressure. Diffuse, highly reproducible surface ionization wave discharge was also observed over the liquid butanol–saturated butanol vapor interface, as well as over the distilled water–saturated water vapor interface, without buffer gas flow. No significant difference was detected between surface ionization discharges sustained using single-polarity (positive or negative), or alternating polarity high-voltage pulses. Plasma emission images yielded preliminary evidence of charge removal from the liquid surface between the pulses on a microsecond time scale. Products of the plasma chemical reaction that accumulated in the ionization wave discharge over the liquid butanol–saturated butanol vapor interface were detected ex situ, using FTIR absorption spectroscopy. Reaction products identified include CO, alkanes (CH4,C2H6, C3H8), alkynes (C2H2), aldehydes (CH2O) and lighter alcohols (CH3OH).},

 abstract = {Positive and negative polarity fast ionization wave discharges in nitrogen and dry air are studied in a rectangular geometry channel over a wide range of time delays between the discharge pulses, τ = 10 ms to 25 μs (pulse repetition rates of ν = 100 Hz–40 kHz). The discharge is generated by alternating polarity high-voltage pulses (peak voltage 18–23 kV, pulse duration 50–60 ns). Ionization wave speed and electric field distributions in the discharge are measured by a calibrated capacitive probe. Plasma images show that for long time delays between the pulses, above τ ~ 1 ms (pulse repetition rate up to ν ~ 1 kHz), the positive polarity wave propagates along the channel walls and the negative polarity wave tends to propagate along the centerline. For time delays below τ ~ 0.5–1.0 ms (above ν ~ 1–2 kHz), both positive and negative polarity waves become diffuse, while wave speed and peak electric field in the wave front become nearly independent of the polarity. Wave speed remains nearly constant for τ ~ 1–10 ms (up to ν ~ 1 kHz), 0.8–0.9 cm/ns, and decreases for shorter time delays, by 30–40 % at τ = 25 μs (ν = 40 kHz). Peak electric field in the positive polarity wave decreases significantly as the pulse repetition rate is increased, from 2.7–3.0 kV/cm to 1.2–1.5 kV/cm. Comparison of experimental results in nitrogen with kinetic modeling calculations at high pulse repetition rates, when the discharge is diffuse, shows good agreement. Calculation results show that peak electric field reduction at high pulse repetition rates is mainly due to higher electron density in the decaying plasma generated by the previous discharge pulse. Reduction of wave speed and coupled energy at high repetition rates is primarily due to slower voltage rise and lower pulse peak voltage, limited by the pulse generator. The model shows that at high pulse repetition rates most of the discharge power is coupled to the plasma behind the wave, at E/N ~ 200–300 Td. Discharge energy loading at ν = 1–40 kHz is 1–2 meV/molecule/pulse.},

The discharge generates stable plasma with high specific energy loading (up to ∼0.5 eV/molecule), and with spatial dimensions sufficiently large to enable laser diagnostic studies. The results demonstrate that significant temperature rise, up to ΔT∼200 K, occurs both in nitrogen and in air, on the time scale shorter than the acoustic time scale. The characteristic time for the rapid temperature rise in air, ∼100 ns, is significantly shorter compared to that in nitrogen, ∼1 µs. In air, a second significant temperature rise, up to ΔT∼350 K, occurs on a time scale of ∼100-500 µs. This “slow” temperature rise is almost entirely missing in nitrogen. Phase-locked schlieren images demonstrate a near cylindrical shape compression wave formed around the discharge filament, both in nitrogen and in air. An additional, near spherical shape compression wave is formed near the cathode, due to significant energy release in the cathode layer of the discharge. The compression waves, caused by rapid localized heating quantified by the present measurements, are similar to the ones produced by a surface nanosecond pulse discharge in atmospheric air used for high-speed flow control, where comparable temperature rise was detected previously.},

 abstract = {A nonempirical, containing no adjustable parameters, theoretical model is suggested for calculations of state-specific dissociation rates in diatomic gases. Effects of molecular rotation and three dimensionality of collisions are consistently accounted for. The model is based upon a modified forced harmonic oscillator (FHO) scaling, with anharmonic frequency correction and energy symmetrization. The FHO scaling allows close-coupled calculations of multiquantum transitions between vibrational states, and it requires evaluation of collisional energy transfer to classical oscillator. Three-dimensional classical energy transfer models in both free-rotation and impulsive (sudden) approximations were used in conjunction with the FHO quantum scaling. The new theory describes the role of various degrees of freedom in dissociation both qualitatively and quantitatively. One of the predictions is that at low and moderate temperatures, dissociation is strongly preferential, with state-specific rates sharply increasing with vibrational energy; however, at high temperatures, the rate dependence on vibrational energy becomes less steep, turning into a virtually nonpreferential. Calculated thermal (equilibrium) and nonequilibrium dissociation rates of oxygen and nitrogen show a very good agreement with shock-tube experimental data taken from the literature.},

In N2/CO mixtures, as many as 38 vibrational levels of CO are observed, in addition to six levels of N2. The CO vibrational distribution function is highly non-Boltzmann, exhibiting the well-known Treanor plateau. In N2/CO/O2 mixtures, up to 13 vibrational levels of O2 are observed, which also exhibit a highly non-Boltzmann distribution. Experimental data are compared to predictions of a master equation kinetic model, which incorporates absorption of the laser radiation, species, and quantum state-specific vibration–vibration and vibration–translation energy exchange, as well as diffusion of vibrationally excited species out of the laser-excited volume. It is shown for the first time that modest power continuous wave lasers can be used to establish highly excited steady-state vibrational distributions of all three major diatomic species in CO-seeded atmospheric pressure dry air. This has implications for the energy-efficient creation of low-temperature, high-pressure air plasmas, in which the principal free electron loss mechanism is known to be three-body attachment to molecular oxygen.},

 abstract = {Electron production rate and electron density in cold optically pumped CO–Ar and CO–N2 plasmas in the presence of small amounts of O2 and NO have been measured using a Thomson discharge probe and microwave attenuation. Nonequilibrium ionization in the plasmas is produced by an associative ionization mechanism in collisions of highly vibrationally excited CO molecules. It is shown that adding small amounts of O2 or NO (50–100 mTorr) to the baseline gas mixtures at P=100 torr results in an increase of the electron density by up to a factor of 20–40 (from ne<1010 cm−3 to ne=(1.5–3.0)×1011 cm−3). This occurs while the electron production rate either decreases (as in the presence of O2) or remains nearly constant within a factor of 2 (as in the presence of NO). It is also shown that the electron–ion recombination rates inferred from these measurements decrease by two to three orders of magnitude compared to their baseline values (with no additives in the cell), down to β≅1.5×10−8 cm3/s with 50–100 mTorr of oxygen or nitric oxide added to the baseline CO–Ar mixture, and β≅(2 to 3)×10−7 cm3/s with 75–100 mTorr of O2 or NO added to the baseline CO–N2 mixture. The overall electron–ion removal rates in the presence of equal amounts of O2 or NO additives turn out to be very close, which shows that the effect of electron attachment to oxygen at these conditions is negligible. These results suggest a novel method of electron density control in cold laser-sustained steady-state plasmas and open a possibility of sustaining stable high-pressure nonequilibrium plasmas at high electron densities and low plasma power budget.},

 abstract = {This article presents an experimental demonstration of a high-pressure unconditionally stable nonequilibrium molecular plasma sustained by a combination of a continuous wave CO laser and a sub-breakdown radio frequency (rf) electric field. The plasma is sustained in a CO/N2 mixture containing trace amounts of NO or O2 at pressures of P=0.4–1.2 atm. The initial ionization of the gases is produced by an associative ionization mechanism in collisions of two CO molecules excited to high vibrational levels by resonance absorption of the CO laser radiation with subsequent vibration-vibration (V-V) pumping. Further vibrational excitation of both CO and N2 is produced by free electrons heated by the applied rf field, which in turn produces additional ionization of these species by the associative ionization mechanism. In the present experiments, the reduced electric field, E/N, is sufficiently low to preclude field-induced electron impact ionization. Unconditional stability of the resultant cold molecular plasma is enabled by the negative feedback between gas heating and the associative ionization rate. Trace amounts of nitric oxide or oxygen added to the baseline CO/N2 gas mixture considerably reduce the electron–ion dissociative recombination rate and thereby significantly increase the initial electron density. This allows triggering of the rf power coupling to the vibrational energy modes of the gas mixture. Vibrational level populations of CO and N2 are monitored by infrared emission spectroscopy and spontaneous Raman spectroscopy. The experiments demonstrate that the use of a sub-breakdown rf field in addition to the CO laser allows an increase of the plasma volume by about an order of magnitude. Also, CO infrared emission spectra show that with the rf voltage turned on the number of vibrationally excited CO molecules along the line of sight increase by a factor of 3–7. Finally, spontaneous Raman spectra of N2 show that with the rf voltage the vibrational temperature of nitrogen increases by up to 30%. This novel energy efficient approach allows sustaining large-volume high-pressure molecular plasmas without the use of a high-power CO laser. This opens a possibility of using the present technique for high-yield plasma chemical synthesis and plasma material processing.},

 abstract = {This article discusses experimental studies of spark-generated shock wave propagation in CO-laser sustained optically pumped CO–Ar–O2 plasmas. The rotational-translational temperature of the plasma is measured by Fourier transform infrared emission spectroscopy. The electron density in the plasma is determined by microwave attenuation. The line-of-sight averaged density distribution across the propagating shock is detected by photoacoustic deflection (PAD). The measurements show that adding small amounts of oxygen (up to 0.1%) to the baseline optically pumped CO–Ar plasma increases the electron density and the ionization fraction by more than an order of magnitude (up to ne=0.9×1010 cm−3 and ne/N=0.8×10−8, respectively), while the gas temperature remains nearly constant, within 3%–5%. Therefore this approach allows varying the electron density in the plasma nearly independently of the gas temperature. The PAD measurements show considerable apparent weakening and dispersion of a shock wave propagating in the optically pumped plasma with a strong radial temperature gradient, compared to the shock propagating in a cold nonionized gas. However, varying the electron density independently of the gas temperature does not produce any detectable effect on the measured gas density distribution across the propagating shock. It is therefore concluded that the observed shock weakening is entirely due to the radial temperature gradient sustained by resonance absorption of the CO laser radiation near the centerline of the shock tube and is not affected by the presence of the charged species in the plasma.},

 abstract = {The paper presents results of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) supersonic boundary layer control experiments using repetitively pulsed, short-pulse duration, high-voltage discharges in M=3 flows of nitrogen and air in the presence of a magnetic field of B=1.5T. We also have conducted boundary layer flow visualization experiments using laser sheet scattering. Flow visualization results show that as the Reynolds number increases, the boundary layer flow becomes much more chaotic, with the spatial scale of temperature fluctuations decreasing. Combined with density fluctuation spectra measurements using laser differential interferometry (LDI) diagnostics, this behavior suggests that boundary layer transition occurs at stagnation pressures of P0∼200–250Torr. A crossed discharge (pulser+dc sustainer) in M=3 flows of air and nitrogen produced a stable, diffuse, and uniform plasma, with the time-average dc current up to 1.0A in nitrogen and up to 0.8A in air. The electrical conductivity and the Hall parameter in these flows are inferred from the current voltage characteristics of the sustainer discharge. LDI measurements detected the MHD effect on the ionized boundary layer density fluctuations at these conditions. Retarding Lorentz force applied to M=3 nitrogen, air, and N2–He flows produces an increase of the density fluctuation intensity by up to 2dB (about 25%), compared to the accelerating force of the same magnitude. The effect is demonstrated for two possible combinations of the magnetic field and current directions producing the same Lorentz force direction (both for accelerating and retarding force).},

 abstract = {This paper presents results of cold magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow deceleration experiments using repetitively pulsed, short pulse duration, high voltage discharge to produce ionization in M=3 nitrogen and air flows in the presence of transverse direct current electric field and transverse magnetic field. MHD effect on the flow is detected from the flow static pressure measurements. Retarding Lorentz force applied to the flow produces a static pressure increase of up to 17%–20%, while accelerating force of the same magnitude results in static pressure increase of up to 5%–7%. The measured static pressure changes are compared with modeling calculations using quasi-one-dimensional MHD flow equations. Comparison of the experimental results with the modeling calculations shows that the retarding Lorentz force increases the static pressure rise produced by Joule heating of the flow, while the accelerating Lorentz force reduces the pressure rise. The effect is produced for two possible combinations of the magnetic field and transverse current directions producing the same Lorentz force direction (both for accelerating and retarding force). This demonstrates that the observed static pressure change is indeed due to the MHD interaction, and not due to Joule heating of the flow in the crossed discharge. No discharge polarity effect on the static pressure was detected in the absence of the magnetic field. The fraction of the discharge input power going into Joule heat in nitrogen and dry air, inferred from the present experiments, is low, α=0.1, primarily because energy remains frozen in the vibrational energy mode of nitrogen. This result provides first direct evidence of cold supersonic flow deceleration by Lorentz force.},

Resonant absorption of infrared radiation from the CO laser produces the nonequilibrium state, in which the heavy species vibrational modes are disproportionately excited, compared to the rotational and translational modes (Tvib≈2000–3000K vs TR∕T≈300K). It is shown that this results in an increase in the plasma free electron lifetime by two orders of magnitude compared to the unexcited cold gas, an effect which is ascribed to complete mitigation of rapid three-body electron attachment to molecular oxygen. A series of heavy species filtered pure rotational Raman scattering measurements are also presented, which exhibit minimal temperature change (+50K), indicating that the observed lifetime increase cannot be due to heavy-species thermal effects. Finally, computational modeling results infer an increase in the rate of O2− detachment by four to five orders of magnitude, compared to the equilibrium value.},

Emission intensity overshoot behind the shock predicted by the model is in satisfactory agreement with the experimental results and is consistent with previous analytic estimates. The model demonstrates that the first and the second positive band emission overshoot behind the shock are produced by energy transfer processes among the triplet electronic states of nitrogen generated in the electric discharge. On the other hand, charge separation and ambipolar electric field produced across the shock layer do not result in electron heating and additional electron impact excitation of electronic states. The calculations show that emission overshoot makes possible accurate detection of a stationary shock layer in supersonic flowing afterglow experiments.},

 abstract = {This paper investigates the mechanism of plasma created by focused CO laser and rf electric field. The plasma is created in a CO/N2 environment, at a total pressure of 600 torr. Ionization of the gases occurs by an associative ionization mechanism, in collisions of two highly vibrationally excited molecules. These highly vibrationally excited states are populated by resonance absorption of the CO radiation followed by anharmonic vibration-vibration (V-V) pumping. Moreover N2 also becomes vibrationally excited due to collisions with vibrationally excited CO. The coupled rf reduced electric field E/N is sufficiently low to prevent electron impact ionization that may create plasma individually, so when a subbreakdown rf field is applied to the plasma, collisions between the free electrons heated by the field and the diatomic species create additional vibrational excitation both in the region occupied by the CO laser beam and outside of the laser beam region. The numerical results show plasma created in both regions (in and out of the CO laser beam region) with the associative ionization mechanism. This suggests a method for creating a stable nonequilibrium plasma. The calculation result is verified by comparison the synthetic spectrum to a measured one.},

 abstract = {A new analytic quasi-one-dimensional model of energy coupling to nanosecond pulse discharge plasmas in plane-to-plane geometry has been developed. The use of a one-dimensional approach is based on images of repetitively pulsed nanosecond discharge plasmas in dry air demonstrating that the plasma remains diffuse and uniform on a nanosecond time scale over a wide range of pressures. The model provides analytic expressions for the time-dependent electric field and electron density in the plasma, electric field in the sheath, sheath boundary location, and coupled pulse energy. The analytic model predictions are in very good agreement with numerical calculations. The model demonstrates that (i) the energy coupled to the plasma during an individual nanosecond discharge pulse is controlled primarily by the capacitance of the dielectric layers and by the breakdown voltage and (ii) the pulse energy coupled to the plasma during a burst of nanosecond pulses decreases as a function of the pulse number in the burst. This occurs primarily because of plasma temperature rise and resultant reduction in breakdown voltage, such that the coupled pulse energy varies approximately proportionally to the number density. Analytic expression for coupled pulse energy scaling has been incorporated into the air plasma chemistry model, validated previously by comparing with atomic oxygen number density measurements in nanosecond pulse discharges. The results of kinetic modeling using the modified air plasma chemistry model are compared with time-resolved temperature measurements in a repetitively pulsed nanosecond discharge in air, by emission spectroscopy, and purely rotational coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy showing good agreement.},

A diffuse nanosecond pulse discharge is generated in a DBD plasma actuator on a surface of a cylinder model placed in air flow in a small scale blow-down supersonic wind tunnel. Discharge energy coupled to the actuator is 7.3–7.8 mJ/pulse. Plasma temperature inferred from nitrogen emission spectra is a few tens of degrees higher than flow stagnation temperature, T = 340 ± 30 K. Phase-locked Schlieren images are used to detect compression waves generated by individual nanosecond discharge pulses near the actuator surface. The compression wave propagates upstream toward the baseline bow shock standing in front of the cylinder model. Interaction of the compression wave and the bow shock causes its displacement in the upstream direction, increasing shock stand-off distance by up to 25%. The compression wave speed behind the bow shock and the perturbed bow shock velocity are inferred from the Schlieren images. The effect of compression waves generated by nanosecond discharge pulses on shock stand-off distance is demonstrated in a single-pulse regime (at pulse repetition rates of a few hundred Hz) and in a quasi-continuous mode (using a two-pulse sequence at a pulse repetition rate of 100 kHz). The results demonstrate feasibility of hypersonic flow control by low-temperature, repetitive nanosecond pulse discharges.},

 abstract = {Fast ionization wave (FIW), nanosecond pulse discharge propagation in nitrogen and helium in a rectangular geometry channel/waveguide is studied experimentally using calibrated capacitive probe measurements. The repetitive nanosecond pulse discharge in the channel was generated using a custom designed pulsed plasma generator (peak voltage 10–40 kV, pulse duration 30–100 ns, and voltage rise time ∼1 kV/ns), generating a sequence of alternating polarity high-voltage pulses at a pulse repetition rate of 20 Hz. Both negative polarity and positive polarity ionization waves have been studied. Ionization wave speed, as well as time-resolved potential distributions and axial electric field distributions in the propagating discharge are inferred from the capacitive probe data. ICCD images show that at the present conditions the FIW discharge in helium is diffuse and volume-filling, while in nitrogen the discharge propagates along the walls of the channel. FIW discharge propagation has been analyzed numerically using quasi-one-dimensional and two-dimensional kinetic models in a hydrodynamic (drift-diffusion), local ionization approximation. The wave speed and the electric field distribution in the wave front predicted by the model are in good agreement with the experimental results. A self-similar analytic solution of the fast ionization wave propagation equations has also been obtained. The analytic model of the FIW discharge predicts key ionization wave parameters, such as wave speed, peak electric field in the front, potential difference across the wave, and electron density as functions of the waveform on the high voltage electrode, in good agreement with the numerical calculations and the experimental results.},

 abstract = {A three-dimensional semiclassical analytic model of vibrational energy transfer in collisions between a rotating diatomic molecule and an atom has been developed. The model is based on analysis of classical trajectories of a free-rotating (FR) molecule acted upon by a superposition of repulsive exponential atom-to-atom potentials. The energy transfer probabilities have been evaluated using the nonperturbative forced harmonic oscillator (FHO) model. The model predicts the probabilities for vibrational energy transfer as functions of the total collision energy, orientation of a molecule during a collision, its rotational energy, and impact parameter. The model predictions have been compared with the results of three-dimensional close-coupled semiclassical trajectory calculations using the same potential-energy surface. The comparison demonstrates not only remarkably good agreement between the analytic and numerical probabilities across a wide range of collision energies, but also shows that the analytic FHO-FR model correctly reproduces the probability dependence on other collision parameters such as rotation angle, angular momentum angle, rotational energy, impact parameter, and collision reduced mass. The model equally well predicts the cross sections of single-quantum and multiquantum transitions and is applicable up to very high-collision energies and quantum numbers. Most importantly, the resultant analytic expressions for the probabilities do not contain any arbitrary adjustable parameters commonly referred to as “steric factors.” The model provides new insight into kinetics of vibrational energy transfer and yields accurate expressions for energy-transfer rates that can be used in kinetic modeling calculations.},

 abstract = {Kinetic modeling is used to analyze energy partition and energy transfer in nanosecond pulse discharges sustained between two spherical electrodes in nitrogen and air. The modeling predictions are compared with previous time-resolved temperature and vibrational population measurements by picosecond broadband coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) and phase-locked Schlieren imaging. The model shows good agreement with experimental data, reproducing experimental discharge current pulse waveforms, as well as dominant processes of energy transfer in the discharge and the afterglow. Specifically, the results demonstrate that the temperature rise in the plasma occurs in two stages, (i) 'rapid' heating on sub-acoustic time scale, dominated by energy pooling processes, N2(B 3Πg) and N(2P,2D) quenching (in nitrogen), and by quenching of excited electronic states of N2 molecules by O2 (in air), and (ii) 'slow' heating due to N2 vibrational relaxation by O atoms (in air), nearly completely missing in nitrogen. Comparison of the model predictions with N2 vibrational level populations confirms that the N2 vibrational temperature rises after the discharge pulse is caused by the 'downward' vibrational–vibrational exchange depopulating higher vibrational levels and populating vibrational level v = 1. The model reproduces temporal dynamics of vibrational level populations and temperature in the discharge and the afterglow, indicating that energy partition among different modes (vibrational, electronic, dissociation, and ionization) is predicted accurately. At the present conditions, energy fraction coupled to the positive column of the discharge filament in air is approximately 50%, with the rest coupled to the cathode layer. Nearly 10% of the total pulse energy is spent on O atom generation, and about 10% is thermalized on a sub-acoustic time scale, producing a strong compression wave in the radial direction. The experimental wave speed is considerably higher compared to the model predictions, by approximately 30%. The reason for this difference may be due to interaction between the cylindrical and spherical compression waves generated in the discharge filament and in the cathode layer, respectively.},

The results are compared with kinetic modeling calculations incorporating pulsed discharge dynamics, kinetics of vibrationally and electronically excited states of nitrogen, plasma chemical reactions, and radial transport. The results show that in air afterglow, NO decay occurs primarily by the reaction with N atoms, NO + N → N2 + O. In the presence of hydrogen, this reaction is mitigated by reaction of N atoms with OH, N + OH → NO + H, resulting in significant reduction of N atom number density in the afterglow, additional NO production, and considerably higher NO number densities. In fuel-lean ethylene-air mixtures, a similar trend (i.e. N atom concentration reduction and NO number density increase) is observed, although [NO] increase on ms time scale is not as pronounced as in H2-air mixtures. In near-stoichiometric and fuel-lean ethylene-air mixtures, when N atom number density was below detection limit, NO concentration was measured to be lower than in air plasma. These results suggest that NO kinetics in hydrocarbon-air plasmas is more complex compared to air and hydrogen-air plasmas, additional NO reaction pathways may well be possible, and their analysis requires further kinetic modeling calculations.},

The discharge is sustained between two spherical electrodes separated by a 1 cm gap and powered by high voltage pulses ~150 ns duration. Discharge energy coupled to the plasma filament 2–3 mm in diameter is 4–5 mJ/pulse, with specific energy loading of up to ~0.3 eV/molecule. At all experimental conditions, a rapid initial rise of electron temperature and electron density during the discharge pulse is observed, followed by the decay in the afterglow, over ~100 ns–1 µs. Electron density in the afterglow decays more rapidly as H2 or O2 fraction in the mixture is increased. In He/H2 mixtures, this is likely due to more rapid recombination of electrons in collisions with and ions, compared to recombination with ions. In O2/He mixtures, electron density decay in the afterglow is affected by recombination with and ions, while the effect of three-body attachment is relatively minor. Peak electron number densities and electron temperatures are n e = (1.7–3.1) 1014 cm−3 and T e = 2.9–5.5 eV, depending on gas mixture composition. Electron temperature in the afterglow decays to approximately T e ≈ 0.3 eV, considerably higher compared to the gas temperature of T = 300–380 K, inferred from O2 pure rotational Raman scattering spectra, due to superelastic collisions.

In the diffuse filament discharge, the experimental results are compared with the predictions of a 2D plasma fluid model. Electron densities are put on an absolute scale using pure rotational Raman spectra in nitrogen, taken without the plasma, for calibration. In the diffuse filament discharge, electron density and electron temperature increase rapidly after breakdown, peaking at n e ≈ 3.5 1015 cm−3 and T e ≈ 4.0 eV. After the primary discharge pulse, both electron density and electron temperature decrease (to n e ~ 1014 cm−3 over ~1 µs and to T e ~ 0.5 eV over ~200 ns), with a brief transient rise produced by the secondary discharge pulse. At the present conditions, the dominant recombination mechanism is dissociative recombination of electrons with molecular ions, . In the afterglow, the electron temperature does not relax to gas temperature, due to superelastic collisions. Electron energy distribution functions (EEDFs) inferred from the Thomson scattering spectra are nearly Maxwellian, which is expected at high ionization fractions, when the shape of EEDF is controlled primarily by electron–electron collisions. The kinetic model predictions agree well with the temporal trends detected in the experiment, although peak electron temperature and electron density are overpredicted. Heavy species temperature predicted during the discharge and the early afterglow remains low and does not exceed T = 400 K, due to relatively slow quenching of metastable He* atoms in two-body and three-body processes. In the surface discharge, peak electron density and electron temperature are n e ≈ 3 1014 cm3 and T e ≈ 4.25 eV, attained after the surface ionization wave reaches the grounded electrode. The sensitivity of the present diagnostics is too low to measure electron density in the plasma during surface ionization wave propagation (estimated to be below n e ≈ 1013 cm−3). After peaking during the primary current pulse, the electron density decays due to dissociative recombination. Electron temperature decreases rapidly over ~150 ns after the primary current pulse rise, to T e ≈ 0.5 eV, followed by a much more gradual electron cooling between the primary and the secondary discharge pulses, due to superelastic collisions providing moderate electron heating in the afterglow.},

A diffuse plasma filament generated between the electrodes in helium during the primary discharge pulse exhibits noticeable constriction during the secondary discharge pulse several hundred ns later. Adding oxygen to the mixture reduces the plasma filament diameter and enhances constriction during the secondary pulse. In the dielectric barrier discharge, diffuse volumetric plasma occupies nearly the entire space between the high voltage electrode and the liquid surface, and extends radially along the surface. In the filament discharge in helium, adding water to the container results in considerable reduction of plasma lifetime compared to the discharge in dry helium, by about an order of magnitude, indicating rapid electron recombination with water cluster ions. Peak electron density during the pulse is also reduced, by about a factor of two, likely due to dissociative attachment to water vapor during the discharge pulse. These trends become more pronounced as oxygen is added to the mixture, which increases net rate of dissociative attachment. Gas temperature during the primary discharge pulse remains near room temperature, after which it increases up to T ~ 500 K over 5 µs and decays back to near room temperature before the next discharge pulse several tens of ms later. As expected, electron density and electron temperature in diffuse DBD plasmas are considerably lower compared to peak values in the filament discharge. Use of Thomson scattering for measurements of electron density and electron temperature in near-surface plasmas is hindered by strong light scattering off the surface.},

 abstract = {The control of the vibrational distribution of nitrogen by energy transfer to CO2 is studied in two closely related experiments. In the first experiment, the time-resolved N2(v = 0–3) vibrational level populations and temperature in the afterglow of a diffuse filament nanosecond pulse discharge are measured using broadband coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy. The rotational–translational temperature in the afterglow is inferred from the partially rotationally resolved structure of the N2(v = 0) band. The measurements are performed in nitrogen, dry air, and their mixtures with CO2. N2 vibrational excitation in the discharge occurs by electron impact, with subsequent vibration–vibration (V–V) energy transfer within the N2 vibrational manifold, vibration–translation (V–T) relaxation, and near-resonance V–V' energy transfer from the N2 to CO2 asymmetric stretch vibrational mode. The results show that rapid V–V' energy transfer to CO2, followed by collisional intramolecular energy redistribution to the symmetric stretch and bending modes of CO2 and their V–T relaxation, accelerate the net rate of energy thermalization and temperature increase in the afterglow. In the second experiment, injection of CO2 into a supersonic flow of vibrationally excited nitrogen demonstrates the effect of accelerated vibrational relaxation on a supersonic shear layer. The nitrogen flow is vibrationally excited in a repetitive nanosecond pulse/DC sustainer electric discharge in the plenum of a nonequilibrium flow supersonic wind tunnel. A transient pressure increase as well as an upward displacement of the shear layer between the supersonic N2 flow and the subsonic CO2 injection flow are detected when the source of N2 vibrational excitation is turned on. CO2 injection leads to the reduction of the N2 vibrational temperature in the shear layer, demonstrating that its displacement is caused by accelerated N2 vibrational relaxation by CO2, which produces a static temperature and a pressure increase in the test section. This demonstrates the significant potential of accelerated vibrational relaxation for nonequilibrium flow control, by injection of rapid 'relaxer' species at a desired location, resulting in the rapid thermalization of vibrational energy in nitrogen and air flows, and producing a significant effect on the flow field.},

 abstract = {Femtosecond, two-photon-absorption laser-induced fluorescence (fs-TALIF) is employed to measure space- and time-resolved distributions of atomic hydrogen and oxygen in moderate-pressure, non-equilibrium, nanosecond-duration pulsed-discharge plasmas. Temporally and spatially resolved hydrogen and oxygen TALIF images are obtained over a range of low-temperature plasmas in mixtures of helium and argon at 100 Torr total pressure. The high-peak-intensity, low-average-energy fs pulses combined with the increased spectral bandwidth compared to traditional ns-duration laser pulses provide a large number of photon pairs that are responsible for the two-photon excitation, which results in an enhanced TALIF signal. Krypton and xenon TALIF are used for quantitative calibration of the hydrogen and oxygen concentrations, respectively, with similar excitation schemes being employed. This enables 2D collection of atomic-hydrogen and -oxygen TALIF signals with absolute number densities ranging from 2 × 1012 cm−3 to 6 × 1015 cm−3 and 1 × 1013 cm−3 to 3 × 1016 cm−3, respectively. These 2D images are the first application of TALIF imaging in moderate-pressure plasma discharges. 1D self-consistent modeling predictions show agreement with experimental results within the estimated experimental error of 25%. The present results can be used to further the development of higher fidelity kinetic models while quantifying plasma-source characteristics.},

 abstract = {Modeling of a crossed pulser-sustainer discharge in the presence of a transverse magnetic field is used to obtain insight into the kinetics of a low-temperature magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) nitrogen plasma. Ionization in the discharge is produced by repetitive high-voltage nanosecond-duration pulses, while the low-voltage dc sustainer discharge couples power to the plasma between pulses. Model predictions are compared with the experimental sustainer discharge current, both without and with magnetic field, showing a satisfactory agreement. At low dc voltages (below the cathode voltage fall $U_{\rm C}$), the calculations show that the entire sustainer discharge, including the cathode layer, remains nonself-sustained and that the electric field does not penetrate into the plasma, which results in a very low sustainer current. This demonstrates that MHD power generation in low-temperature plasmas with MHD open voltages that are below the cathode fall is not feasible. At higher voltages $(U_{\rm dc} > U_{\rm C})$, when the cathode layer becomes self-sustained, the sustainer current grows approximately linear with the dc voltage. This occurs because the applied dc field does not produce any additional ionization in the plasma that is outside the cathode layer. In the presence of a magnetic field, the sustainer current is significantly lower than the current without a magnetic field, which is due to the Hall effect. At $U_{\rm dc} > U_{\rm C}$, the model predicts a significant electron and ion drift in the ${\mmb E}\times{\mmb B}$ direction due to the Lorentz force. Charge separation that is induced by the disparity in electron and ion mobilities also causes the entire plasma to shift in the ${\mmb E}\times{\mmb B}$ direction, which is approximately at the ion slip velocity. The estimated neutral flow velocity change due to a collisional momentum transfer from the charged to the neutral species in the plasma is consistent with the prediction of quasi-1-D phenomenological MHD equations, as well as with the previous experimental results in a low-temperature MHD wind tunnel.},

 abstract = {This paper presents results of low-temperature plasma-assisted combustion experiments in premixed ethylene–air and methane–air flows. The plasma was generated by high-voltage, nanosecond pulse duration, high repetition rate pulses. The high reduced electric field during the pulse allows efficient electronic excitation and molecular dissociation, thereby generating a pool of chemically active radical species. The low duty cycle of the repetitively pulsed discharge improves the discharge stability and helps sustain diffuse, uniform, and volume filling nonequilibrium plasma. Plasma temperature was inferred from nitrogen second positive band system emission spectra and calibrated using thermocouple measurements in preheated flows (without plasma). The experiments showed that adding fuel to the air flow considerably increases the flow temperature in the plasma, up to $\Delta T = 250\ ^{\circ}\hbox{C}{-}350\ ^{\circ}\hbox{C}$. On the other hand, adding fuel to nitrogen flow at the same flow and discharge conditions resulted in a much less pronounced plasma temperature rise, only by about $\Delta T = 50\ ^{\circ} \hbox{C}$. This shows that temperature rise in the air–fuel plasma is due to plasma chemical fuel oxidation reactions initiated by the radicals generated in the plasma. In a wide range of conditions, generating the plasma in air–fuel flows resulted in flow ignition, flameholding, and steady combustion downstream of the discharge. Plasma-assisted ignition occurred at low air plasma temperatures, $100\ ^{\circ}\hbox{C}{-}200\ ^{\circ}\hbox{C}$, and low discharge powers, $\sim$100 W ($\sim$1% of heat of reaction). At these conditions, the reacted fuel fraction is up to 85%–95%. The present results suggest that the flow temperature rise caused by plasma chemical fuel oxidation results in flow ignition downstream of the plasma.},

 abstract = {Absolute hydroxyl radical (OH) concentration is determined in stoichiometric hydrogen–air mixtures at $P =\break 54$–$94\ \hbox{torr}$ and initial temperature of $T = 100 \ ^{\circ} \hbox{C}$–$200 \ ^{\circ}\hbox{C}$, which are both functions of time, after the application of a single approximately 25-ns-duration approximately 20-kV discharge pulse and 60 $\mu\hbox{s}$ after the final pulse of a variable-length burst of pulses, using single-photon laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). Relative LIF signal levels are put on an absolute number density scale by means of calibration with a standard atmospheric-pressure near-adiabatic Hencken flat-flame burner. By obtaining OH LIF data in both the plasma and the flame and correcting for differences in the collisional quenching and vibrational energy transfer rates, absolute OH number density has been determined. For a single discharge pulse, the absolute OH temporal profile is found to rise rapidly during the initial $\sim$0.1 ms after discharge initiation and decay relatively slowly, with a characteristic time scale of $\sim$1 ms. In repetitive burst mode, the absolute OH number density is observed to rise rapidly during the first approximately ten pulses (0.25 ms) and then level off to a near steady-state plateau. In all cases, a large secondary rise in OH number density is also observed, which is clearly indicative of ignition, with ignition time ranging from 5 to 10 ms, for initial temperatures of 100 °C and 200 °C and pressures in the range of 54–94 torr. Plasma kinetic modeling predictions capture this trend quantitatively, using both a full 22-hydrogen–air-chemical-reaction set and a reduced 9-reaction set.},

 abstract = {Ignition time is measured in premixed preheated hydrogen–air flows excited by a repetitive nanosecond pulse discharge in a plane-to-plane geometry. ICCD images of the plasma and the flame demonstrate that mild preheating of the fuel–air flow greatly improves plasma stability and precludes filament formation. At the initial temperatures of $T_{0} = 100-200\ ^{\circ}\hbox{C}$, hydrogen–air plasmas remain stable and uniform up to at least $P = 150\ \hbox{torr}$, and ignition occurs in a large volume. In contrast, ignition in less uniform preheated ethylene–air plasmas occurs locally, near the electrode edges, with flame propagating toward the center of the plasma. Ignition time in hydrogen–air mixtures is measured at initial temperatures of $T_{0} = 100-200\ ^{\circ}\hbox{C}$, pressures of $P = 40$–150 torr, equivalence ratios of $\phi = 0.5$–1.2, and pulse repetition rates of $\nu = 10$–40 kHz. The results of ignition time measurements are compared with the predictions of the hydrogen–air plasma chemistry model, showing good agreement. Nitrogen emission spectra are used to measure time-resolved temperature in air and hydrogen–air plasmas. The results show that ignition begins at the plasma temperature of $T \approx 700\ \hbox{K}$ and results in a rapid temperature rise. By turning off dominant plasma chemical radical generation processes in kinetic modeling calculations, while keeping discharge energy loading the same, it is demonstrated that ignition is driven by additional energy release in reactions of plasma-generated radicals with hydrogen. To determine if plasma-generated radicals may reduce ignition temperature, discharge pulse burst was terminated before the onset of ignition, and ignition delay time was measured versus plasma temperature at the end of the burst. Experimental ignition delay time is in reasonably good agreement with kinetic modeling calculations. The kinetic model predicts significant plasma-assisted ignition threshold temperature reduction at the present conditions compared to thermal ignition, up to $\Delta T = 180\ \hbox{K}$.},

 abstract = {The paper presents the results of temporally and spatially resolved electric field measurements in a nanosecond pulse discharge in atmospheric air, sustained between a razor edge high-voltage electrode and a plane grounded electrode covered by a thin dielectric plate. The electric field is measured by picosecond four-wave mixing in a collinear phase-matching geometry, with time resolution of approximately 2 ns, using an absolute calibration provided by measurements of a known electrostatic electric field. The results demonstrate electric field offset on the discharge center plane before the discharge pulse due to surface charge accumulation on the dielectric from the weaker, opposite polarity pre-pulse. During the discharge pulse, the electric field follows the applied voltage until 'forward' breakdown occurs, after which the field in the plasma is significantly reduced due to charge separation. When the applied voltage is reduced, the field in the plasma reverses direction and increases again, until the weak 'reverse' breakdown occurs, producing a secondary transient reduction in the electric field. After the pulse, the field is gradually reduced on a microsecond time scale, likely due to residual surface charge neutralization by transport of opposite polarity charges from the plasma. Spatially resolved electric field measurements show that the discharge develops as a surface ionization wave. Significant surface charge accumulation on the dielectric surface is detected near the end of the discharge pulse. Spatially resolved measurements of electric field vector components demonstrate that the vertical electric field in the surface ionization wave peaks ahead of the horizontal electric field. Behind the wave, the vertical field remains low, near the detection limit, while the horizontal field is gradually reduced to near the detection limit at the discharge center plane. These results are consistent with time-resolved measurements of electric field components, which also indicate that vertical electric field reverses direction after the ionization wave.},

 abstract = {Reacting flows and plasmas are prevalent in a wide array of systems involving defense, commercial, space, energy, medical, and consumer products. Understanding the complex physical and chemical processes involving reacting flows and plasmas requires measurements of key parameters, such as temperature, pressure, electric field, velocity, and number densities of chemical species. Time-resolved measurements of key chemical species and temperature are required to determine kinetics related to the chemical reactions and transient phenomena. Laser-based, noninvasive linear and nonlinear spectroscopic approaches have proved to be very valuable in providing key insights into the physico-chemical processes governing reacting flows and plasmas as well as validating numerical models. The advent of kilohertz rate amplified femtosecond lasers has expanded the multidimensional imaging of key atomic species such as H, O, and N in a significant way, providing unprecedented insight into preferential diffusion and production of these species under chemical reactions or electric-field driven processes. These lasers not only provide 2D imaging of chemical species but have the ability to perform measurements free of various interferences. Moreover, these lasers allow 1D and 2D temperature-field measurements, which were quite unimaginable only a few years ago. The rapid growth of the ultrafast-laser-based spectroscopic measurements has been fueled by the need to achieve the following when measurements are performed in reacting flows and plasmas. They are: (1) interference-free measurements (collision broadening, photolytic dissociation, Stark broadening, etc), (2) time-resolved single-shot measurements at a rate of 1–10 kHz, (3) spatially-resolved measurements, (4) higher dimensionality (line, planar, or volumetric), and (5) simultaneous detection of multiple species. The overarching goal of this article is to review the current state-of-the-art ultrafast-laser-based spectroscopic techniques and their remarkable development in the past two decades in meeting one or all of the above five goals for the spectroscopic measurement of temperature, number density of the atomic and molecular species, and electric field.},

 abstract = {The effect of nanosecond pulsed plasma discharges on a laminar, lean ( = 0.5) premixed H2/O2/N2 flame is studied at low pressure (25 torr), using a novel plasma-flame facility, non-intrusive laser diagnostics, and high-fidelity numerical simulations. Spatially-resolved quantitative OH mole fraction and temperature measurements are performed with and without a burst of 200 nanosecond discharge pulses using laser-induced fluorescence. Measured temperatures increase by 20% in both the pre-heat and post-flame zones with the use of the plasma discharge. In addition, OH mole fractions increase by 100 - 500% in the preheat zone and an average increase of 40% in the post-flame gases. Simulations are conducted with a one-dimensional, multi-scale, pulsed-discharge model with detailed plasma-combustion kinetics to develop additional insight into the complex plasma and flame interactions. Good agreement between measured and predicted OH and temperature profiles provides confidence in the model framework. The reduced electric field, E/N, during each pulse varies inversely with number density. A significant portion of the input energy is expended to electron impact ionization in the high temperature regions downstream of the flame because of high E/N in this region (700-1000 Td).},

 abstract = {This work presents results of time-resolved, absolute measurements of OH number density, nitrogen vibrational temperature, and translational-rotational temperature in air and lean hydrogen-air mixtures excited by a diffuse filament nanosecond pulse discharge, at a pressure of 100 Torr and high specific energy loading. The main objective of these measurements is to study kinetics of OH radicals at the conditions of strong vibrational excitation of nitrogen, below autoignition temperature. N2 vibrational temperature and gas temperature in the discharge and the afterglow are measured by ns broadband coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering. Hydroxyl radical number density is measured by laser induced fluorescence, calibrated by Rayleigh scattering. The results show that the discharge generates strong vibrational nonequilibrium in air and H2-air mixtures for delay times after the discharge pulse of up to ~1 ms, with a peak vibrational temperature of T v ≈ 1900 K at T ≈ 500 K. Nitrogen vibrational temperature peaks at 100–200 µs after the discharge pulse, before decreasing due to vibrational-translational relaxation by O atoms (on the time scale of several hundred µs) and diffusion (on ms time scale). OH number density increases gradually after the discharge pulse, peaking at t ~ 100–300 µs and decaying on a longer time scale, until t ~ 1 ms. Both OH rise time and decay time decrease as H2 fraction in the mixture is increased from 1% to 5%. Comparison of the experimental data with kinetic modeling predictions shows that OH kinetics is controlled primarily by reactions of H2 and O2 with O and H atoms generated during the discharge. At the present conditions, OH number density is not affected by N2 vibrational excitation directly, i.e. via vibrational energy transfer to HO2. The effect of a reaction between vibrationally excited H2 and O atoms on OH kinetics is also shown to be insignificant. As the discharge pulse coupled energy is increased, the model predicts transient OH number density overshoot due to the temperature rise caused by N2 vibrational relaxation by O atoms, which may well be a dominant effect in discharges with specific energy loading.},

 abstract = {This work presents the results of number density measurements of metastable Ar atoms and ground state H atoms in diluted mixtures of H2 and O2 with Ar, as well as ground state O atoms in diluted H2–O2–Ar, CH4–O2–Ar, C3H8–O2–Ar, and C2H4–O2–Ar mixtures excited by a repetitive nanosecond pulse discharge. The measurements have been made in a nanosecond pulse, double dielectric barrier discharge plasma sustained in a flow reactor between two plane electrodes encapsulated within dielectric material, at an initial temperature of 500 K and pressures ranging from 300 Torr to 700 Torr. Metastable Ar atom number density distribution in the afterglow is measured by tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy, and used to characterize plasma uniformity. Temperature rise in the reacting flow is measured by Rayleigh scattering. H atom and O atom number densities are measured by two-photon absorption laser induced fluorescence. The results are compared with kinetic model predictions, showing good agreement, with the exception of extremely lean mixtures. O atoms and H atoms in the plasma are produced mainly during quenching of electronically excited Ar atoms generated by electron impact. In H2–Ar and O2–Ar mixtures, the atoms decay by three-body recombination. In H2–O2–Ar, CH4–O2–Ar, and C3H8–O2–Ar mixtures, O atoms decay in a reaction with OH, generated during H atom reaction with HO2, with the latter produced by three-body H atom recombination with O2. The net process of O atom decay is O + H → OH, such that the decay rate is controlled by the amount of H atoms produced in the discharge. In extra lean mixtures of propane and ethylene with O2–Ar the model underpredicts the O atom decay rate. At these conditions, when fuel is completely oxidized by the end of the discharge burst, the net process of O atom decay, O + O → O2, becomes nearly independent of H atom number density. Lack of agreement with the data at these conditions is likely due to diffusion of H atoms from the partially oxidized regions near the side walls of the reactor into the plasma. Although significant fractions of hydrogen and hydrocarbon fuels are oxidized by O atoms produced in the plasma, chain branching remains a minor effect at these relatively low temperature conditions.},

The measurements have been performed in a diffuse plasma generated in a dielectric barrier discharge, in plane-to-plane geometry. Absolute calibration of the electric field in the plasma is provided by the Laplacian field measured before breakdown. Sub-nanosecond time resolution is obtained by using a 150 ps duration laser pulse, as well as by monitoring the timing of individual laser shots relative to the voltage pulse, and post-processing four-wave mixing signal waveforms saved for each laser shot, placing them in the appropriate 'time bins'. The experimental data are compared with the analytic solution for time-resolved electric field in the plasma during pulse breakdown, showing good agreement on ns time scale. Qualitative interpretation of the data illustrates the effects of charge separation, charge accumulation/neutralization on the dielectric surfaces, electron attachment, and secondary breakdown. Comparison of the present data with more advanced kinetic modeling is expected to provide additional quantitative insight into air plasma kinetics on ~ 0.1–100 ns scales.},

 abstract = {Summary form only given. The paper addresses the fundamental problems of energy transformation in nonequilibrium laser-excited plasmas. It is well known that a laser can be considered a heat engine. In particular, in molecular gas lasers excited by an electric discharge, the high-temperature electrons (i.e. the hot reservoir) excite the high quantum states of the molecules (the upper laser levels). Work is extracted front the system by the emission of coherent radiation the induced transitions between the upper and the lower laser levels, u/spl rarr/1. The rest of the energy is ultimately returned to the translational mode (i.e. the cold reservoir) in collisional relaxation of the lower laser levels. Typically, the electron temperature in such lasers is T/sub e//spl sim/1-2 eV, and the gas translational temperature is T/spl sim/100-300 K. The efficiency of such an engine is e=(E/sub u/-E/sub 1/)/E/sub u/, where E/sub u/ and E/sub 1/ are the energies of the upper and the lower laser levels, respectively, which can be shown to equal the reversible engine thermodynamic efficiency.},

A sub-breakdown RF field is applied to the plasma. The collisions between the free electrons heated by the field and the diatomic species create additional vibrational excitation in the plasma region, and the rf energy is coupled to the plasma.

 abstract = {The electron production rate and electron density in optically pumped argon and nitrogen plasmas seeded with carbon monoxide, and with the addition of small amounts of oxygen or nitric oxide have been measured. A Thomson discharge probe and microwave attenuation were used to measure the electron production rate and electron density, respectively. Nonequilibrium ionization in these plasmas is produced by an associative ionization mechanism in collisions of highly vibrationally excited carbon monoxide molecules. Carbon monoxide is excited by optical pumping using a carbon monoxide laser. High vibrational states (up to ${\mathrm{v}}=40$) of CO are subsequently populated by vibration-vibration energy transfer. It is shown that adding small amounts of oxygen or nitric oxide (50–100 mTorr) to the baseline gas mixtures at ${\mathrm{P}}=100$ Torr results in an increase of the electron density by up to a factor of 20–40. This occurs while the electron production rate slightly decreases or remains nearly constant. It is also shown that the electron-ion recombination rates inferred from these measurements decrease by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude compared to the case with no oxygen or nitric oxide added. The overall electron-ion removal rates in the presence of equal amounts of oxygen or nitric oxide additives are nearly equal, which shows that the effect of electron attachment to oxygen at these conditions is negligible. These results suggest a novel method of electron density control in cold laser-sustained steady-state plasmas and afford a means of sustaining stable, high-pressure, nonequilibrium plasmas at high electron densities with a low plasma power budget.},

 abstract = {Summary form only given, as follows. Stable, low-power-budget, atmospheric pressure air plasmas are sustained using a combination of an electron beam as an efficient volume ionization source. Simultaneous optically pumped vibrational nonequilibrium of the diatomic air species is maintained to reduce the electron removal rate. The electron production rate in the plasmas is measured using a Thomson discharge probe and electron densities are determined from conductivity measurements as well as using microwave attenuation. Energy is transferred into the vibrational modes of the diatomic air species using resonant absorption of CO laser radiation by small amounts (1-5%) of carbon monoxide seeded into the air with subsequent vibration-vibration energy transfer between carbon monoxide and the other diatomics. Perpendicular to the laser beam axis a 0-80 keV, 0-20 mA electron beam enters the plasma cell through an aluminum foil window. The e-beam is operated in pulsed mode with a low duty cycle to reduce thermal stress on the foil window. At the intersection of the laser and the electron beam a plasma region with a volume of approximately 1 ccm is formed. We present measurements of the dependence of the electron removal rate on the level of vibrational excitation within the plasma. The power budgets required for the electron beam ionization and for maintaining a vibrational nonequilibrium by optical pumping as well as the total power budget required to sustain the cold atmospheric pressure air plasmas will be presented.},

The laser has a total power output of 10 W, with about 0.25 W on a 1/spl rarr/0 band and is repetitively pulsed, which allows studying time-dependent excitation.

 abstract = {Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are synthesized in a thermally non-equilibrium flow reactor, in which extreme molecular vibrational mode dis-equilibrium of the primary feedstock, carbon monoxide (CO) gas, is maintained by using a powerful and efficient CO gas laser. The CO molecules absorb the laser radiation on the lowest 10 vibrational transitions and transfer energy to high vibrational states by vibration-vibration energy exchange collisions. This leads to a highly non-equilibrium energy distribution in the CO, which provides enough energy for the carbon-producing CO disproportionation reaction to occur. The vibrationally excited CO reacts in the presence of metal catalysts to form, primarily, carbon dioxide and structured carbon molecules, notably SWNTs, in this continuous (non-batch) process. Iron pentacarbonyl is employed as the catalyst precursor, which dissociates in the plasma and subsequently forms small iron clusters. The influence of iron pentacarbonyl concentration on the quality of the nanotube material is investigated. Ropes of single-walled carbon nanotubes with a high degree of alignment have been observed in deposits created in the CO plasma without any post-production processing. A nanotube content of better than 50% is observed in the deposited material for certain synthesis conditions. At low pressure, substantial quantities of about 20 mg/hour of nanotube containing material are produced. The non-equilibrium synthesis process has been successfully scaled to high plasma pressures up to an atmosphere. We will present results on the production rate and purity of the nanotube containing material under these conditions. IR, visible and UV spectroscopy in the flow reactor has been used to control process parameters.},

 abstract = {Electric field in nanosecond pulse discharges in ambient air is measured by picosecond four-wave mixing, with absolute calibration by a known electrostatic field. The measurements are done in two geometries, (a) the discharge between two parallel cylinder electrodes placed inside quartz tubes, and (b) the discharge between a razor edge electrode and distilled water surface. In the first case, breakdown field exceeds DC breakdown threshold by approximately a factor of four, 140 ± 10 kV cm−1. In the second case, electric field is measured for both positive and negative pulse polarities, with pulse durations of ~10 ns and ~100 ns, respectively. In the short duration, positive polarity pulse, breakdown occurs at 85 kV cm−1, after which the electric field decreases over several ns due to charge separation in the plasma, with no field reversal detected when the applied voltage is reduced. In a long duration, negative polarity pulse, breakdown occurs at a lower electric field, 30 kV cm−1, after which the field decays over several tens of ns and reverses direction when the applied voltage is reduced at the end of the pulse. For both pulse polarities, electric field after the pulse decays on a microsecond time scale, due to residual surface charge neutralization by transport of opposite polarity charges from the plasma. Measurements 1 mm away from the discharge center plane, ~100 μm from the water surface, show that during the voltage rise, horizontal field component (Ex ) lags in time behind the vertical component (Ey ). After breakdown, Ey is reduced to near zero and reverses direction. Further away from the water surface (≈0.9 mm), Ex is much higher compared to Ey during the entire voltage pulse. The results provide insight into air plasma kinetics and charge transport processes near plasma-liquid interface, over a wide range of time scales.},

 abstract = {Time-resolved electric field in ns pulse discharge plasmas generated in room air and in an atmospheric pressure hydrogen diffusion flame has been measured by ps four-wave mixing, for plane-to-plane electrode geometry. Electric field is put on the absolute scale using the Laplacian field measured before breakdown. The results show that peak electric field during breakdown in the flame, approximately 40 kV/cm, is significantly lower compared to that in room air, 75 kV/cm, due to higher temperature of combustion products. In both cases, peak electric field is higher compared to DC breakdown field. Both in air and in the flame, the electric field follows the applied voltage before breakdown and decreases rapidly after breakdown, due to charge separation and plasma self-shielding. The electric field in air is compared with the predictions of an analytic model of ns pulse breakdown, showing good agreement between the predicted and the measured breakdown field. The model also predicts earlier breakdown as well as breakdown voltage reduction as the temperature is increased, in qualitative agreement with the experimental data. The use of the present ps four-wave mixing diagnostics for measurements of electric fields below ∼20 kV/cm in atmospheric pressure flames is challenging, due to low signal-to-noise. The sensitivity of the present diagnostics is controlled by the high temperature and low N2 fraction in the combustion product mixture, as well as by the limited bandwidth of the Stokes beam generated by the stimulated Raman cell, which provides access only to several rotational levels of nitrogen molecules. The present diagnostics will have much better sensitivity in high-pressure flames, since the four-wave mixing signal scales as the squared number density of nitrogen.},

 abstract = {Plasma-assisted oxidation of atmospheric pressure hydrogen- and hydrocarbon-oxygen mixtures diluted in argon is analyzed by kinetic modeling, over a wide range of temperatures. In the experiments, preheated reactant mixtures are excited by a repetitively pulsed, double dielectric barrier ns discharge in plane-to-plane geometry, at near-isothermal conditions. Plasma images and temperature distributions in the discharge indicate that the reactant flow is nearly uniform, justifying the use of quasi-0D approximation in kinetic modeling. The kinetic model is based on a plasma chemistry mechanism combined with a conventional combustion reaction mechanism. The model does not contain adjustable parameters such as reduced electric field in the plasma, used in a number of previous 0D modeling studies. Comparison of the modeling predictions with the experimental data for hydrogen and methane oxidation exhibits good agreement between measured and predicted fuel concentrations over a wide range of temperatures, showing that the yield of primary radicals generated in the plasma is predicted accurately. Concentrations of intermediate hydrocarbon species predicted by the model are also in good agreement with the experiments, with the exception of acetylene below the hot ignition point. For ethylene and propane oxidation, the model overpredicts fuel consumption at low temperatures, also overpredicting concentration of CO, the dominant oxidation product, and underpredicting acetaldehyde concentration. This indicates that low-temperature pathways of formaldehyde formation, a major precursor for CO, as well as low-temperature reactions of several radicals which are precursors for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, are not represented accurately in both conventional reaction mechanisms used. Although concentrations of intermediate hydrocarbon species in ethylene and propane are predicted relatively well, kinetics of formation and decay of acetylene remains not understood. This may be due to inaccurate branching ratio for dissociative quenching of metastable argon by heavy hydrocarbon species, as well as deficiencies of the conventional reaction mechanisms.},

 abstract = {Performance parameters of an electric discharge excited, supersonic flow CO laser operated with significant amounts of air species in the laser mixture is studied experimentally and by kinetic modeling. The results demonstrate that adding nitrogen to the CO–He mixture increases the laser power significantly, by up to a factor of 3. Adding oxygen reduces CO vibrational excitation and results in a steep laser power reduction. Adding air to the laser mixture also produces higher output power, such that the positive effect of nitrogen outweighs the negative effect of oxygen. This result indicates that a chemical CO laser, not dependent on the electric discharge for excitation, may be capable of operating in a mixture of carbon vapor and air. Performance of a supersonic flow chemical laser excited by a reaction of carbon vapor and molecular oxygen is analyzed by kinetic modeling. Peak laser power is predicted at the C vapor mole fraction of 0.2%, when 15% of energy stored in CO vibrational energy mode (4.5% of the reaction enthalpy) is converted to laser power. At higher C vapor mole fractions, flow temperature rise caused by exothermic reactions and by CO vibrational relaxation results in rapid reduction of the predicted laser power.},

 abstract = {Electric field vector components in a nanosecond pulse, surface dialectric barrier discharge plasma actuator are measured by picosecond second harmonic generation, for positive, negative, and alternating polarity pulse trains. Plasma images show that in the same polarity train, the positive polarity discharge develops as two consecutive surface ionization waves, while the negative polarity discharge propagates as a single diffuse ionization wave. In the alternating polarity train, both positive and negative polarity discharge plasmas become strongly filamentary. In all pulse trains, the measurement results demonstrate a significant electric field offset before the discharge pulse, due to the surface charge accumulation during previous discharges pulses. This demonstrates that charge accumulation is a significant factor affecting the electric field in the discharge, even at very low pulse repetition rates. Peak electric field measured in the alternating polarity pulse train is lower compared to that in same polarity trains. However, the coupled pulse energy in the alternating polarity train is much higher, by a factor of 3–4, most likely due to the neutralization of the surface charge accumulated on the dielectric during the previous, opposite polarity pulses. This suggests that plasma surface actuators powered by alternating polarity pulse trains may generate higher amplitude thermal perturbations, producing a stronger effect on the flow field. The present results show that the time scale for the electric field reduction in the plasma after breakdown is fairly long, several tens of ns, including the conditions when the discharge develops as a diffuse ionization wave. This suggests that a considerable fraction of the energy is coupled to the plasma at a relatively low reduced electric field, several tens of Townsend. At these conditions, the discharge energy fraction thermalized as rapid heating would remain fairly low, thus limiting the effect on the flow caused by the high-amplitude localized thermal perturbations.},

 abstract = { Time-resolved electric field is measured in ns pulse and AC sine wave dielectric barrier discharges sustained in an atmospheric pressure hydrogen diffusion flame, using picosecond second harmonic generation. Individual electric field vector components are isolated by measuring the second harmonic signals with different polarizations. Electric field measurements in a ns pulse discharge are self-calibrating, since the field follows the applied voltage until breakdown. Electric field is measured in a ns pulse discharge sustained both in the hydrogen flow below the flame and in the reaction zone of the flame. Peak electric field in the reaction zone is lower compared to that in the near-room temperature hydrogen flow, due to a significantly lower number density. In hydrogen, most of the energy is coupled to the plasma at the reduced electric field of E/N ≈ 50–100 Td. In both cases, the electric field decreases to near zero after breakdown, due to plasma self-shielding. The time scale for the electric field reduction in the plasma is relatively long, several tens of ns, indicating that it may be controlled by a relatively slow propagation of the ionization wave over the dielectric surfaces. In the AC discharge, the electric field is put on the absolute scale by measuring a Laplacian electric field between two parallel cylinder electrodes. The measurement results demonstrate that a strong electric field in the plasma-enhanced flame is produced during the entire AC voltage period, without correlation with the random micro-discharges detected in the plasma images. The measurement results indicate consistently higher peak electric field during the negative AC half-period, as well as a significant electric field offset. Both the asymmetry and the offset of the electric field are likely responsible for the ion wind resulting in the flame distortion. The results suggest that at the present conditions the ion wind is dominated by the transport of negative ions generated in the ambient air plasma near the flame. The results demonstrate a significant potential of ps second harmonic generation diagnostics for non-intrusive measurements of the electric field in atmospheric pressure flames enhanced by electric discharge plasmas.},

 abstract = {The electric field in an ionization wave discharge in nitrogen at 20–100 mbar, initiated by positive polarity, high-voltage, ns duration pulses, is measured by ps second harmonic generation. The axial electric field component is determined both during the propagation of the ionization wave along the discharge tube, and after the wave reaches the grounded electrode, spanning the entire discharge gap. The temporal resolution of the present measurements is 200 ps, with the spatial resolution in the axial direction of approximately 0.5 mm. The second harmonic signal exhibits a quadratic dependence on the Laplacian electric field but indicates that in this pressure range most of the signal is generated within the wall of the tube. Absolute calibration of the signal is obtained from the current shunt data, after the ionization wave has reached the grounded electrode. Comparison of the data taken at different pressures shows that the peak value of the axial electric field in the wave front, 8–11 kV cm−1, has a fairly weak dependence on pressure, with the peak reduced electric field reaching ≈2000 Td at 20 mbar. Reducing the pressure from 100 to 20 mbar, while keeping the discharge pulse voltage waveform the same, steepens the ionization wave front considerably, from 3.0 to 1.0 ns full width at half maximum. The results demonstrate that ps second harmonic generation may be employed for electric field measurements in low-pressure discharges, discharges sustained in small diameter capillary tubes, and discharges sustained in gas mixtures with low nonlinear susceptibility, at the conditions when the detection of the signal generated directly in the plasma is challenging. High temporal resolution of the present measurements indicates a possibility of detection of non-local electron kinetics effects induced by a rapidly varying, high peak value electric field in low and moderate pressure ionization wave discharges.},

@article{pub.1114349820,
 abstract = { Repetitive ns pulse, dielectric barrier discharge voltage waveforms, combined with a tail several ms long, are used to induce oscillations of a counterflow atmospheric pressure diffusion flame. A baseline ns pulse discharge operated at 10 Hz results in a relatively modest oscillatory response of the flame, which becomes more pronounced in burst mode operation, at the same burst repetition rate of 10 Hz. This effect is most likely caused by the residual electric field after the discharge pulse, producing the electrohydrodynamic (EHD) force (“ion wind”) on the charges generated during the discharge, although plasma chemistry and Joule heating by the discharge may also contribute. Manipulating the external circuit to add a variable duration tail to the discharge pulse, without changing the pulse shape during breakdown or the pulse repetition rate, considerably enhances the impulse of the EHD force and increases the amplitude of the flame oscillations. To quantify this effect, the electric field distribution between the electrodes during and after the discharge pulse is measured by ps Electric Field Induced Second Harmonic (E-FISH) diagnostic. The results show that the electric field is maintained during the voltage tail, although it is lower compared to the Laplacian field due to the charge accumulation on the dielectric sleeves covering the electrodes. The time scale of the flame oscillations at the present conditions, of the order of ∼10 ms, is limited by the relatively slow momentum transfer from the ions to the neutral species. The present results demonstrate feasibility of enhancing the flame control authority, by combining a high peak ionization fraction generated by a ns pulse discharge with the EHD force applied on a long time scale, using a single plasma generator.},

 abstract = {The time-resolved electric field in a nanosecond pulse discharge plasma in atmospheric pressure air is measured using the Electric Field Induced Second Harmonic (E-FISH) diagnostic. The electric field is placed on an absolute scale by calibration against a Laplacian field. At relatively low peak voltages, when the plasma is generated only near the pin high-voltage electrode, the electric field is measured ahead of the ionization wave during the entire voltage pulse, exhibiting a strong field enhancement compared to the Laplacian field, by about an order of magnitude. As the peak voltage is increased and the ionization wave traverses the laser beam, the electric field is measured both ahead of the wave and behind the ionization front, where the field drops rapidly due to the charge separation and plasma self-shielding. When the wave reaches the grounded electrode, the discharge transitions into a conduction phase in which the potential is redistributed within the gap. The electric field in the vicinity of the pin then increases again, following the applied voltage waveform for the rest of the pulse. The effective time resolution of the present measurements is 150 ps. Based on the single shot data, we find that the peak electric field in the wave front is moderately influenced by the applied voltage and varies between 160 and 210 kV cm−1. This study demonstrates the viability of the E-FISH diagnostic for this class of atmospheric pressure discharges and paves the way for future in-depth studies of this particular problem.},

CRDS measurements of N2(A3Σu +,v = 0–2) populations are made in the discharge afterglow at pressures of 22 and 39 Torr. The data reduction procedure takes into account the linewidth of the pulsed laser source, which is comparable with the absorption linewidth and results in a non-single exponential ring down decay. Peak N2(A3Σu +,v = 0–2) populations after a 10-pulse ns discharge burst are in the range of 1012–1013 cm−3. In the afterglow, these populations exhibit a relatively slow decay with the characteristic time of approximately 500 μs, most likely due to the quenching by N atoms. TDLAS data have been taken at a higher pressure of 132 Torr. Absolute time-resolved N2(A3Σu +,v = 0,1) number densities are measured during ns pulse discharge bursts up to 5 pulses long and in the afterglow, peaking at 6·1012 cm−3 and 3·1013 cm−3, respectively. The results indicate that N2(A3Σu +) is generated after every discharge pulse on a 20–50 μs time scale, much longer compared to the discharge pulse duration of ~100 ns, and subsequently decays between the pulses. The decay rate increases during the discharge burst. In the afterglow, N2(A3Σu +,v = 0,1) population decay significantly more rapidly compared to the low-pressure CRDS conditions, with the characteristic time of approximately 160 μs after a 5-pulse discharge burst.},

The measurements have been done using a laser sheet and a focused laser beam. Absolute calibration is obtained by measuring a known Laplacian electric field distribution for the same geometry and at the same flow conditions. The results show non-monotonous electric field distribution across the jet, with two maxima produced by the surface ionization waves propagating over water. Considerable electric field enhancement is detected near the surface. Residual charge accumulation on the water surface is detected only in the negative polarity pulse discharge. The results provide insight into the charge species kinetics and transport in atmospheric pressure plasma jets, and produce data for detailed validation of high-fidelity kinetic models. EFISH generation using a ns pulse duration laser is employed for time-resolved measurements of the axial and transverse electric field in a pin-to-pin ns pulse discharge in ambient air, at atmospheric pressure and at 2 bar. The results demonstrate that the time-varying electric field can be measured accurately over the duration of the laser pulse, 15-20 ns long, with the temporal resolution limited by the response time of the detector. Each data set provides the time-accurate electric field over a period of up to 10 ns. Time-resolved electric fields over longer time periods are obtained by overlapping the individual data sets. Absolute calibration is obtained by measuring the Laplacian field distribution in the discharge gap before breakdown, taking into account the residual charge accumulation on the surface of the dielectric encapsulating the grounded electrode. The results demonstrate the feasibility of ns EFISH measurements in high-pressure transient plasmas, using widely available ns pulse duration Nd:YAG lasers.},

 abstract = {This work forms part of a larger effort to develop a suite of diagnostics for making measurements in non-equilibrium, nanosecond pulse discharges, so as to facilitate an improved understanding of the plasma kinetics. Electric field induced second harmonic (E-FISH) generation, is used to probe the electric field in a fast ionization wave, nanosecond pulse discharge in pure N2 at a pressure of 20 mbar. The field evolution during the fast ionization wave development is clearly captured in the form of three distinct phases. An initial field overshoot ahead of the front to about 10.5 kV/cm (or about 2 kTd), followed by a field drop as the wave traverses the measurement location, and finally a subsequent rise as a quasi-steady state regime is established. TALIF measurements of N-atom density are also performed with a view to understanding the impact of the reduced electric field on the consequent atomic species production. These measurements are limited to the post-discharge phase, mainly due to the poor signal to raise ratio associated with the lower atomic densities and strong fluorescence-overlapping plasma emission. A relatively low peak N-atom density of about 5.5 x 1012 cm-3 is obtained, in line with the low specific deposited energy of this discharge (0.01 eV/molecule). Finally, attempts to model this plasma show that the results of simulations are strongly influenced by the radial non-uniformity of the discharge.},

The repeatability of the shock velocity is below 1.3%. The effects of the diaphragm thickness, driver gas composition and initial pressure in the driven on the shock velocity are investigated.

 abstract = {Non-intrusive laser diagnostics of metastable N2 molecules in the lowest excited electronic state, A3Σu+, are used for measurements of N2(A3Σu+,v) vibrational level populations in ns pulse discharge plasmas in molecular gas mixtures and in a nonequilibrium supersonic flow. In high pressure plasmas, at pressures of 100-400 Torr, time-resolved absolute N2(A3Σu+,v=0.1) populations are measured by single-pass, continuous wave Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS). In a supersonic flow, at a pressure of several Torr, absolute N2(A3Σu+,v=0,1) populations are determined by Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy (CRDS). TDLAS measurements are made in nitrogen, H2-N2, O2-N2, and NO-N2 mixtures excited by a double dielectric barrier, repetitively pulsed, ns discharge in a plane-to-plane geometry, operated at a pulse repetition rate of 100 kHz. The results are compared with kinetic modeling predictions, identifying the dominant mechanisms of N2(A3Σu+) generation and decay during the discharge pulses and in the afterglow. Temporal evolution of N2(A3Σu+,v) populations during the discharge bursts in nitrogen provides an indirect measurement of time-resolved N atom number density, since collisional quenching by N atoms is the dominant process controlling N2(A3Σu+) decay. CRDS measurements are made in nitrogen, in the test section of a nonequilibrium flow supersonic wind tunnel with the steady-state run time of approximately 10 seconds. The flow is excited by a 4 kHz repetitive ns pulse discharge in the wind tunnel plenum, at plenum pressures of P0=200-300 Torr, and expands through a two-dimensional contoured nozzle to the Mach number of M=3.7-4.2. The cavity ring down time is not affected by the supersonic flow. During each run, 50 single-shot ring down traces are acquired, demonstrating good shot-to-shot reproducibility. N2(A3Σu+,v=0,1) populations and the flow temperature are inferred from the single-shot CRDS data. The two diagnostic techniques are complementary and can be used for characterization of both low-temperature plasmas and nonequilibrium reacting flows over a wide range of pressures, as well as at short run time high-enthalpy flow facilities.},

 abstract = {Electric field induced second harmonic (EFISH) generation using a ns pulse duration laser has been employed for time-resolved measurements of the axial and transverse electric field in a pin-to-pin ns pulse discharge in ambient air, at atmospheric pressure and at 2 bar. The results demonstrate that the time-varying electric field can be measured accurately over the duration of the laser pulse 1520 ns long, with the temporal resolution (potentially sub-ns) limited by the response time of the detector. Each data set provides time-accurate electric field over a period of up to 10 ns. Time-resolved electric fields over longer time periods are measured by adjusting the laser Q-switch delay, and using the composite data obtained by overlapping the individual data sets. Absolute calibration of the electric field is obtained from the comparison of the experimental data with the Laplacian field distribution in the discharge gap before breakdown, taking into account the residual charge accumulation on the surface of the dielectric encapsulating the grounded pin electrode. The results demonstrate the feasibility of ns EFISH measurements in high-pressure transient plasmas, using widely available ns pulse duration Nd:YAG lasers.},

 abstract = {Temporal and spatial distributions of the electric field in an atmospheric pressure, ns pulse, positive and negative polarity helium plasma jets are measured by ps electric field induced second harmonic generation. The measurements have been done in a quasi-two-dimensional plasma jet impinging on liquid water, using a laser sheet and a focused laser beam positioned at different heights above the water surface. Absolute calibration of the electric field is obtained by measuring a known Laplacian electric field distribution for the same geometry and at the same flow conditions. The vertical component of the electric field is determined by isolating the second harmonic signal with the vertical polarization. The measured electric field is averaged over the span of the plasma jet, in the direction of the laser sheet or the focused laser beam. The spatial resolution of the laser sheet measurements is approximately 15 m across the sheet, with the temporal resolution of 10 ns. The spatial resolution of the focused laser beam measurements is approximately 180 m across the beam, with the temporal resolution of 2.5 ns. The results show non-monotonous electric field distribution across the jet, with two maxima produced by the surface ionization waves propagating over water. Considerable electric field enhancement is detected near the surface. Residual charge accumulation on the water surface is detected only in the negative polarity pulse discharge. The results provide new insight into the charge species kinetics and transport in atmospheric pressure plasma jets, and produce data for detailed validation of high-fidelity kinetic models.},

 abstract = {This work describes the characterization of an optical pulse-slicer for performing electric field measurements using the Electric Field Induced Second Harmonic generation (or E-FISH) method. This laser-based diagnostic generally favors ultrashort (sub-nanosecond) pulses, given their intrinsically higher intensities and superior measurement time resolution. However, such laser systems can often prove inaccessible due to their high costs. Our response to this problem is to develop a Pockels-cell-based pulse slicing scheme, compatible with the more affordable and ubiquitous class of nanosecond laser sources. Using such a slicer, we demonstrate the ability to slice a 35 mJ, 20 ns (FWHM), 1064 nm pulse from a conventional Nd:YAG laser down to about 3 ns (FWHM) with an energy of 2 mJ . These shorter pulses are in turn used to make electric field measurements in a pulsed electrostatic field (at 5 bar) using E-FISH . In agreement with previous studies, measurements performed with these sliced pulses not only have the expected benefit of improving the time resolution of the field measurement, but also reduce the possibility of laser-plasma interactions due to the lower laser pulse energy required. The current pulse slicer incorporates an off-optimum design Pockels cell, which limits the minimum pulse width and maximum energy that may be realized. It is anticipated that higher energies and a reduction in the pulse width to around 100 ps may be achieved with further optimization, and could present a cost-effective approach to extending the applicability of the E-FISH method.},

 abstract = {Electric-field-induced second-harmonic generation, or E-FISH, has received renewed interest as a nonintrusive tool for probing electric fields in gas discharges and plasmas using ultrashort laser pulses. An important contribution of this work lies in establishing that the E-FISH method works effectively in the nanosecond regime, yielding field sensitivities of about a kV/cm at atmospheric pressure from a 16 ns pulse. This is expected to broaden its applicability within the plasma community, given the wider access to conventional nanosecond laser sources. A Pockels-cell-based pulse-slicing scheme, which may be readily integrated with such nanosecond laser systems, is shown to be a complementary and cost-effective option for improving the time resolution of the electric field measurement. Using this scheme, a time resolution of ∼3  ns is achieved, without any detriment to the signal sensitivity. This could prove invaluable for nonequilibrium plasma applications, where time resolution of a few nanoseconds or less is often critical. Finally, we take advantage of the field vector sensitivity of the E-FISH signal to demonstrate simultaneous measurements of both the horizontal and vertical components of the electric field.},

 abstract = {In this work, the propagation of the surface ionization wave (SIW) in the nanosecond pulsed surface dielectric barrier discharge with different dielectric materials and pulse repetition rates is investigated. The current waveforms at different locations along the route of the SIW propagation are obtained, based on a specially designed ground strip array geometry. The temporal evolution and spatial distribution of the electric field during the SIW propagation are measured by using the electric field induced second harmonic generation method. The distribution of the residual surface potential after the discharge is mapped with a Kelvin electrostatic probe, which verifies both the existence of the residual electric field and its opposite direction to that during the SIW propagation. It is found that with the dielectric material on which the surface charges decay faster, there are the well-pronounced primary and secondary SIWs with a higher velocity on the voltage rising edge and both the peak current and the peak electric field are also higher, with a less spatial attenuation along the SIW propagation route. It is demonstrated that the residual surface charges with the same polarity as the high-voltage pulse suppress the development of the SIW.},

 abstract = {Ionization wave development during ns pulse breakdown in nitrogen between two parallel plate, dielectric-covered electrodes is studied by ps electric field induced second harmonic (EFISH) generation and kinetic modeling. The results indicate formation of two well-defined ionization waves in the discharge gap, which requires a relatively high initial electron density. The first, anode-directed, wave is produced by ‘sweeping’ the initial electrons by the applied voltage pulse. The second wave originates between the cathode and the first wave front, due to the field enhancement in this region, generating two wave fronts propagating in opposite directions and observed in plasma emission images. Only the anode-directed front of the second wave is detected by the EFISH measurements, most likely due to the proximity of the cathode-directed front to the wall. Both the measurements and the modeling predictions exhibit a transient electric field overshoot in the center of the gap, caused by the anode-directed front of the second wave. The boundary between the plasma domains formed ahead of the first wave and behind the second wave, observed in the plasma emission images, is detected by the EFISH measurements and predicted by the modeling calculations. The electron density and coupled energy distributions predicted by the model at the end of the discharge pulse are nearly uniform, except near the cathode-adjacent wall, where the applicability of the present model is uncertain and which is not accessible to the EFISH measurements.},

 abstract = {Hybrid plasmas, sustained by a repetitive ns pulse discharge and a sub-breakdown RF waveform in N2 and its mixtures with H2, CO, and CO2, are studied using laser diagnostics and kinetic modeling. Plasma emission images show that adding the RF waveform to the ns pulse train does not result in a discharge instability development, since the RF field does not produce additional ionization. Unlike a ns pulse/DC discharge, the ns pulse/RF plasma is sustained using a single pair of electrodes external to the discharge cell. Measurements of electronically excited molecules, N2(A3Σu+), and vibrationally excited molecules in the ground electronic state, N2(X1Σg+, v), demonstrate that these species are generated selectively. N2(A3Σu+) molecules are produced predominantly by the ns pulse discharge waveform, while vibrational excitation of the ground electronic state N2 is mainly due to the RF waveform. Strong vibrational nonequilibrium is maintained at a low translational–rotational temperature. The ns pulse/RF discharge data demonstrate that the quenching of N2(A3Σu+) is not affected by N2 vibrational excitation. Kinetic modeling shows that the rate of N2(A3Σu+) quenching in a ns pulse discharge in nitrogen is underpredicted, and the modeling predictions agree with the data only if the rate of N atom generation by electron impact dissociation of N2 is increased by approximately an order of magnitude. This suggests a significant effect of excited electronic states on the net dissociation rate. Infrared emission spectra of ns pulse/RF hybrid plasmas in CO–N2 and CO2–N2 mixtures show that the present approach also generates strong vibrational excitation of CO and CO2, with the CO yield in the CO2–N2 mixture approximately a factor of two higher compared to that in a ns pulse discharge alone. This indicates a significant contribution of the vibrationally enhanced CO2 dissociation in the hybrid plasma. The present results demonstrate that sustaining the hybrid plasma in reacting molecular gas mixtures may isolate the plasma chemical reaction pathways dominated by vibrationally excited molecules from those of electronically excited molecules and atomic species.},

The diffuse plasma is generated by a repetitively pulsed, double dielectric barrier, ns discharge across a 10 mm gap in a plane-to-plane geometry, at pressures of up to 400 Torr. The results of TDLAS measurements in nitrogen and in H2–N2, O2–N2, and NO–N2 plasmas are compared with kinetic modeling predictions, identifying the mechanisms of N2(A3Σu +) generation and decay during the discharge pulses and in the afterglow. Comparison with the modeling predictions indicates that electron impact dissociation of N2 from the ground electronic state significantly underpredicts the yield of N atoms. The present data suggest that N2 dissociation in the plasma also occurs during the energy pooling process in collisions of two N2(A3Σu +) molecules. The results also show that high-pressure, high repetition rate, volume-scalable ns pulse discharges can be used for efficient generation of atomic species for plasma chemical and plasma catalysis syntheses. In an NO–N2 mixture, it is shown that the N2(A3Σu +) decay is controlled by the rapid energy transfer to NO, resulting in its electronic excitation and UV emission (NO γ bands). The diagnostics used in the present work can be used for the accurate characterization of both high-pressure, low-temperature gas discharge plasmas and high-temperature nonequilibrium flows generated in pulsed facilities such as shock tubes and expansion tunnels.},

Time-resolved vibrational level populations of molecular oxygen in the ground electronic state, O2(X,v=8-20), are measured by ps Laser Induced Fluorescence on the O2 Schumann Runge bands, with absolute calibration by NO LIF in a NO-N2 mixture with a known composition, at quenching-free conditions. O atom number density in the same mixture is measured by ps Two-Photon absorption LIF (TALIF). The discharge generates a diffuse volumetric plasma, without well-pronounced filaments. The temperature in the plasma is measured by Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS) of excited Ar atoms. The results indicate a rapid initial decay of the O2(X,v=8-20) molecules generated by electron impact in the discharge, on ~ 100 μs time scale, due to the V-V exchange and V-T relaxation. This decay is followed by a much slower decay, on the time scale much longer compared to the characteristic time for V-V relaxation, up to several ms. This indicates an additional process of O2(v) generation by chemical reactions initiated by the O atom recombination. This effect is observed both in the non-preheated and preheated O2-Ar mixtures. However, comparison of the time-resolved O2(v=8-13,17-20) vibrational level populations after the burst excitation of non-preheated and preheated exhibits significant differences. In the preheated mixtures, peak O2(v) populations during the slow decay following the excitation are significantly lower, suggesting a significant effect of O atom recombination via the reaction pathways involving ozone. Additional data need to be taken in preheated mixtures with the low O2 mole fraction, ~1%, and at higher pressures, at the conditions when the discharge excitation would result in dissociation of most of O2 molecules in the mixture.},

 abstract = {Absolute, time-resolved HO2 number density is measured by Cavity Ringdown Spectroscopy (CRDS) in dilute fuel-O2-Ar mixtures excited by a repetitive ns pulse discharge in a heated plasma flow reactor. Number density of HO2 radical generated during the plasma-assisted oxidation of H2, CH4, and C2H4 is measured at relatively low temperatures in the reactor, ranging from 300 to 600 K. The measurements are made at the discharge pulse repetition rate of 10 kHz, for different discharge burst durations, 5-100 pulses (0.5-10 ms), 100 µs after the last pulse. Additional measurements are made in the afterglow after the discharge burst, for different delays between the end of the burst and the laser pulse, ranging from 100 µs to 89 ms. The results show that for most experimental conditions, HO2 is generated only during the discharge burst, as expected. However, in the H2-O2-Ar mixture at elevated temperatures, 400-600 K, HO2 persists in the afterglow during the entire flow residence time in the reactor, up to 10 ms. This indicates increased reactivity and a more significant effect of the chain propagation and chain branching processes, which dominate the radical recombination reactions even at these relatively low temperatures. Comparison of the experimental results with the kinetic modeling predictions provides quantitative insight into the processes controlling generation and decay of HO2 radical in fuel-air mixtures excited by the plasma, mapping the conditions at which the generation of the primary radical pool by the plasma results in significant fuel oxidation and subsequent ignition.},

 abstract = {NO planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) is used to obtain images of laser-induced breakdown plasma plumes in NO-seeded nitrogen and dry air at near atmospheric pressure. Single-shot PLIF-images show that the plume development 5–50 μs after the breakdown pulse is fairly reproducible shot-to-shot, although the plume becomes increasingly stochastic on longer timescales, 100–500 μs. The stochastic behavior of the plume is quantified using probability distributions of the loci of the plume boundary. Analysis of the single-shot images indicates that the mixing of the plume with ambient gas on sub-ms time scale is insignificant. The induced flow velocity in the plume is fairly low, up to 30 m s−1, suggesting that laser breakdowns are ineffective for mixing enhancement in high speed flows. The ensemble-averaged PLIF images indicate the evolution of the plume from an initially elongated shape to near-spherical to toroidal shape, with a subsequent radial expansion and formation of an axial jet in the center. Temperature distributions in the plume in air are obtained from the NO PLIF images, using two rotational transitions in the NO(X, v′ = 0 → A, v″ = 0) band, J″ = 6.5 and 12.5 of the QR12 + Q2 branch. The results indicate that the temperature in the plume remains high, above 1000 K, for approximately 100 μs, after which it decays gradually, to below 500 K at 500 μs. The residual NO fraction in the plume is ∼0.1%, indicating that repetitive laser-assisted ignition may result in significant NO-generation. These measured temperature and velocity distributions can be used for detailed validation of kinetic models of laser-induced breakdown and assessment of their predictive capability.},

The pump laser beam (1064 nm, nominal pulse duration 150 ps, pulse energy 20-40 mJ) is separated into two coaxial or crossing beams, overlapping only near the focal point. The Spatially Enhanced EFISH (SEEFISH) signal is generated over a shorter beam overlap region compared to the collinear phase matching. Blocking of either of the two beams results in a complete suppression of the signal. The signal is spatially isolated from the “conventional” EFISH signal and measured by a photomultiplier detector. Measurements of a known Laplacian field generated between two parallel cylinder electrodes in ambient air shows that SEEFISH improves the spatial resolution of the measurements by about a factor of 2. The spatial resolution is improved further by reducing the focal distance of the lens. The magnitude of the SEEFISH signal is significantly lower compared to that of the single-beam EFISH and decreases dramatically with the beam crossing angle, due to the phase mismatch. The new diagnostic has a significant potential for measurements of electric field distributions in high-pressure plasmas, with an additional benefit of removing the stray second harmonic signal from the optical access windows.},

The first series of measurements is made in discharge pulse bursts at a relatively low pulse repetition rate (3 kHz), when N2(A3Σu+) generation and decay after individual discharge pulses is fully resolved. The second set of data is taken during a sequence of two pulse bursts generated at a higher pulse repetition rate (100 kHz), for different delay times between the first and second bursts. This approach is used to determine the effect of accumulation and decay of reacting species generated in the plasma, including N, H, and O atoms, CO molecules, and C2 hydrocarbon product species, on the rate of N2(A3Σu+) production and quenching. The effect of these species can be isolated since the rates of N2(A3Σu+) quenching by the reactant species (H2, CH4, and CO2) are slow. Comparison of the measurement results with the kinetic modeling predictions is used to provide insight into the plasma chemical reaction kinetics. The results complement the measurements of N, H, O, and CO in high-pressure reacting plasmas, and quantify the plasma chemical processes driven by the electron impact dissociation and electronic excitation.},

Comparison of the measurement results with the kinetic modeling predictions, specifically the significant reduction of the N2(A3Σu+) populations and the rate of N atom generation during the burst, suggests that these two trends are related. The slow N atom decay in the afterglow, on the time scale longer than the discharge burst, demonstrates that the latter trend is not affected by N atom recombination, diffusion to the walls, or convection with the flow. This leads to the conclusion that the energy pooling in collisions of N2(A3Σu+) molecules is a major channel of nitrogen dissociation in electric discharges where a significant fraction of the input energy goes to electronic excitation of N2. Additional measurements in a 1% H2-N2 mixture demonstrate a further significant reduction of N2(A3Σu+,v=0,1) populations, due to the rapid quenching by H atoms accumulating in the plasma. Comparison with the modeling predictions suggests that the N2(A3Σu+) molecules may be initially formed in the highly vibrationally excited states. The reduction of the N2(A3Σu+) number density also diminishes the contribution of the energy pooling process into N2 dissociation, thus reducing the N atom number density. The rate of N atom generation during the burst also decreases, due to its strong coupling to N2(A3Σu+,v) populations. On the other hand, the rate of H atom generation, produced predominantly by the dissociative quenching of the excited electronic states of nitrogen by H2, remains about the same during the burst, resulting in a nearly linear rise of the H atom number density. Comparison of the kinetic model predictions with the experimental results suggests that the yield of H atoms during the quenching of excited electronic state of N2 by molecular H2 is significantly less than 100%. The present results quantify the yield of N and H atoms in high-pressure H2-N2 plasmas, which have a significant potential for ammonia generation using plasma-assisted catalysis.},

The results indicate a much stronger vibrational excitation in the RF plasma jet, due to the lower reduced electric field and higher discharge power. In a ns pulse discharge in nitrogen/He, nitrogen vibrational temperature is significantly lower compared to that in N₂/Ar, due to the more rapid V-T relaxation of nitrogen by helium atoms.

The experimental data in the RF plasma jet in N₂/Ar jet are compared with the kinetic modeling predictions.

Transient excitation of nitrogen and carbon dioxide asymmetric stretch vibrational energy modes is detected during the discharge burst. The time-resolved rate of carbon monoxide generation does not correlate with nitrogen or carbon dioxide asymmetric stretch vibrational temperatures, suggesting that carbon dioxide dissociation via the vibrational excitation is insignificant at the present conditions. The rate of carbon monoxide generation decreases during the discharge burst. The estimated specific energy cost of the carbon monoxide product is close to that of N atoms in pure nitrogen, measured at similar operated conditions. The effective cost, based on the input energy fraction going to carbon dioxide, is approximately 6.5 eV, close to the threshold of carbon dioxide electron impact dissociation cross section. This suggests that carbon dioxide dissociation by electron impact may be the dominant channel of carbon monoxide generation at the present conditions.},

 abstract = {The response of counterflow diffusion flames to sub-breakdown DC and AC electric fields, as well as their superposition with ns pulse discharge waveforms, is studied in the plane-to-plane electrode geometry. Sub-breakdown DC and low-frequency AC electric fields cause the flame displacement toward the grounded electrode, in the direction of the applied field, indicating that the body force on the positive ions exceeds that on the electrons and negative ions. As the AC frequency increases, the flame response becomes less pronounced, due to the reduction of the electrohydrodynamic (EHD) body force impulse over the AC half-period. The electric field in the electrode gap is determined by ps Electric Field Induced Second Harmonic (E-FISH) generation, with absolute calibration using sub-breakdown ns pulses overlapped with the measured electric field waveform. The results show that the electric field distribution across the flame in the current saturation regime follows the Laplacian field. This indicates that the space charge density in the gap is too low to distort the applied DC or AC field, consistent with the kinetic modeling predictions. Combining a nanosecond pulse discharge with a sub-breakdown DC field generates a diffuse plasma across the entire gap. Time-resolved and spatially resolved measurements of the electric field in the discharge indicate the ionization wave propagation between the electrodes. The present results do not exhibit a detectable flame displacement enhancement by ns discharge pulses combined with a sub-breakdown field, observed previously. Kinetic modeling calculations show that the absence of this effect in the plane-to-plane geometry is due to the rapid plasma self-shielding. This indicates that alternative electrode geometries limiting the self-shielding would be more effective for the plasma / electric field enhanced flameholding and flame stabilization applications.},

 abstract = {Time-resolved, absolute HO2 number density in diluted H2 O2-Ar, CH4 O2-Ar, and C2H4 O2-Ar mixtures excited by a repetitive ns pulse discharge in a heated plasma flow reactor is measured by Cavity Ringdown Spectroscopy (CRDS). The experimental results are obtained at T = 300–600 K and P = 130 Torr, both during the discharge pulse burst and in the afterglow. The HO2 number density is inferred from the CRDS data using a spectral model exhibiting good agreement with previous measurements of absolute HO2 absorption cross sections. In the room-temperature H2 O2 mixture, as well as in CH4 O2 and C2H4 O2 mixtures over the entire temperature range studied, HO2 is generated only during the discharge burst and decays in the afterglow. However, in the H2 O2 mixture at elevated temperatures, T = 400–600 K, HO2 persists in the afterglow up to 10 ms after the discharge burst, comparable with the flow residence time in the reactor. Comparison with kinetic modeling shows that the sustained reactivity after the source of radicals is turned off is due to a chain propagation/ hydrogen oxidation process, which dominates the radical recombination reactions. The kinetic modeling predictions are in good agreement with the relative HO2 number density measured in all three mixtures, although the model underpredicts the absolute number densities in H2 O2 at T = 400–600 K by up to a factor of two. Detection of the sustained low-temperature reactivity in H2 O2, initiated by the radical generation in the plasma, suggests that the plasma excitation may also affect kinetics of oxidation and reforming of fuels exhibiting low-temperature chemistry below hot ignition point.},

 abstract = {The 2022 Roadmap is the next update in the series of Plasma Roadmaps published by Journal of Physics D with the intent to identify important outstanding challenges in the field of low-temperature plasma (LTP) physics and technology. The format of the Roadmap is the same as the previous Roadmaps representing the visions of 41 leading experts representing 21 countries and five continents in the various sub-fields of LTP science and technology. In recognition of the evolution in the field, several new topics have been introduced or given more prominence. These new topics and emphasis highlight increased interests in plasma-enabled additive manufacturing, soft materials, electrification of chemical conversions, plasma propulsion, extreme plasma regimes, plasmas in hypersonics, data-driven plasma science and technology and the contribution of LTP to combat COVID-19. In the last few decades, LTP science and technology has made a tremendously positive impact on our society. It is our hope that this roadmap will help continue this excellent track record over the next 5–10 years.},

Dielectric surfaces support propagation of surface ionization waves (SIWs) which charge the surface with there being electric field enhancement due to curvature of the surface.

In this paper, we discuss results from computational and experimental investigations of SIW propagation over a series of 250 µm × 250 µm dry and water-filled channels.

 abstract = {The spatial resolution of the ps electric field induced second harmonic (EFISH) generation has been enhanced by using non-collinear pump laser beam arrangements. The pump laser beam (1064 nm, nominal pulse duration 150 ps, pulse energy 20–40 mJ) is separated into two coaxial or crossing beams, overlapping only near the focal point. The spatially enhanced EFISH (SEEFISH) signal is generated over a shorter beam overlap region compared to the collinear beam arrangement. Blocking of either of the two beams results in a complete suppression of the signal. The signal is spatially isolated from the ‘conventional’ EFISH signal and measured by a photomultiplier detector. Measurements of a known Laplacian field generated between two parallel cylinder electrodes in ambient air shows that SEEFISH improves the spatial resolution of the measurements by up to a factor of 2, such that the measurement results agree with the Laplacian field distribution. The spatial resolution is improved further by reducing the focal distance of the lens. The magnitude of the SEEFISH signal is significantly lower compared to that of the single-beam EFISH and decreases rapidly as the beam crossing angle is increased, due to the phase mismatch. This approach has a significant potential for measurements of electric field distributions in high-pressure plasmas, with an additional benefit of removing the stray second harmonic signal from the optical access windows.},

 abstract = {The methyl radical plays a central role in plasma-assisted hydrocarbon chemistry but is challenging to detect due to its high reactivity and strongly pre-dissociative electronically excited states. We report the development of a photo-fragmentation laser-induced fluorescence (PF-LIF) diagnostic for quantitative 2D imaging of methyl profiles in a plasma. This technique provides temporally and spatially resolved measurements of local methyl distributions, including in near-surface regions that are important for plasma-surface interactions such as plasma-assisted catalysis. The technique relies on photo-dissociation of methyl by the fifth harmonic of a Nd:YAG laser at 212.8 nm to produce CH fragments. These photofragments are then detected with LIF imaging by exciting a transition in the B-X(0, 0) band of CH with a second laser at 390 nm. Fluorescence from the overlapping A-X(0, 0), A-X(1, 1), and B-X(0, 1) bands of CH is detected near 430 nm with the A-state populated by collisional B-A electronic energy transfer. This non-resonant detection scheme enables interrogation close to a surface. The PF-LIF diagnostic is calibrated by producing a known amount of methyl through photo-dissociation of acetone vapor in a calibration gas mixture. We demonstrate PF-LIF imaging of methyl production in methane-containing nanosecond pulsed plasmas impinging on dielectric surfaces. Absolute calibration of the diagnostic is demonstrated in a diffuse, plane-to-plane discharge. Measured profiles show a relatively uniform distribution of up to 30 ppm of methyl. Relative methyl measurements in a filamentary plane-to-plane discharge and a plasma jet reveal highly localized intense production of methyl. The utility of the PF-LIF technique is further demonstrated by combining methyl measurements with formaldehyde LIF imaging to capture spatiotemporal correlations between methyl and formaldehyde, which is an important intermediate species in plasma-assisted oxidative coupling of methane.},

 abstract = {Time-resolved CO2 and N2 vibrational populations and translational-rotational temperature are measured in a CO2–N2 plasma sustained by a ns pulse discharge burst in plane-to-plane geometry. Time-resolved, absolute number density of CO generated in the plasma is also inferred from the experimental data. CO2 and CO vibrational populations are measured by mid-IR, tunable quantum cascade laser absorption spectroscopy, and N2 vibrational populations are measured by the ns broadband vibrational CARS. Transient excitation of N2 and CO2 asymmetric stretch vibrational energy modes is detected during the discharge burst. The time-resolved rate of CO generation does not correlate with N2 or CO2(ν 3) vibrational temperatures, indicating that CO2 dissociation via the vibrational excitation is insignificant at the present conditions. The rate of CO generation decreases gradually during the discharge burst. The estimated specific energy cost of the CO product is close to that of N atoms in pure nitrogen, measured previously at similar operating conditions. Comparison of the experimental data with the kinetic modeling analysis indicates that CO2 dissociation in collisions with electronically excited N2 molecules is the dominant channel of CO generation at the present conditions, although the inferred CO yield in these processes is significantly lower than 1. The effect of vibrational energy transfer between N2 and CO2 on the plasma chemical processes is insignificant. The kinetic model underpredicts a rapid reduction of the N2 and CO2(ν 3) vibrational temperatures during the later half of the discharge burst and in the afterglow. V–T relaxation of N2 by N and O atoms generated in the ns pulse discharge plasma does not affect the vibrational relaxation rate in a significant way. However, rapid V–T relaxation of CO2 by O atoms has a significant effect on the relaxation rate. The difference between the experimental data and the modeling predictions may be due to the unknown scaling of the CO2–O V–T rates with the vibrational quantum number.},

To assess the impact of vibrationally excited species in plasma-catalysis, quantitative measurements near interfaces are required, which remains challenging. In this letter, we report spatially resolved measurements of vibrationally excited N2 in the effluent of an atmospheric pressure plasma jet by molecular beam mass spectrometry (MBMS). The mass spectrometry signals as a function of electron energy of the ionizer were fitted with the effective electron-impact ionization cross section of N2(v) considering the vibrational distribution function as determined by a detailed vibrational level resolved plasma kinetic calculation. The reported method presented in this letter shows the capability of MBMS to measure vibrationally excited species of N2 near interfaces when the vibrational distribution function is known or assumed and shows excellent agreement with state-to-state kinetic models of N2(v).},

The first series of measurements is made in the discharge pulse bursts at a relatively low pulse repetition rate (3 kHz), when the N2(A3Σu +) generation and decay after individual discharge pulses is fully resolved. The second set of data is taken during a sequence of two pulse bursts generated at a higher pulse repetition rate (100 kHz), for different delay times between the first and second bursts. This approach is used to determine the effect of accumulation and decay of reacting species generated in the plasma, including N, H, and O atoms, CO molecules, and C2 hydrocarbon product species, on the rate of N2(A3Σu +) production and quenching. The effect of these species can be isolated since the rates of N2(A3Σu +) quenching by the initial reactant species (H2, CH4, and CO2) are slow. Comparison of the measurement results with the kinetic modeling predictions is used to obtain insight into the plasma chemical reaction kinetics. The results complement the measurements of N, H, O, and CO in high-pressure reacting plasmas, and help quantify the plasma chemical processes driven by the electron impact dissociation, electronic excitation, and reactive quenching of the excited electronic states. The present results may be used for the development and validation of higher fidelity kinetic models of reacting plasmas, incorporating state-specific electronic and vibrational energy transfer and chemical reactions.},

 abstract = {Plasma stability in reactive mixtures is critical for various applications from plasma-assisted combustion to gas conversion. To generate stable and uniform plasmas and control the transition towards filamentation, the underlying physics and chemistry need a further look. This work investigates the plasma thermal-chemical instability triggered by dimethyl-ether (DME) low-temperature oxidation in a repetitive nanosecond pulsed dielectric barrier discharge. First, a plasma-combustion kinetic mechanism of DME/air is developed and validated using temperature and ignition delay time measurements in quasi-uniform plasmas. Then the multi-stage dynamics of thermal-chemical instability is experimentally explored: the DME/air discharge was initially uniform, then contracted to filaments, and finally became uniform again before ignition. By performing chemistry modeling and analyzing the local thermal balance, it is found that such nonlinear development of the thermal-chemical instability is controlled by the competition between plasma-enhanced low-temperature heat release and the increasing thermal diffusion at higher temperature. Further thermal-chemical mode analysis identifies the chemical origin of this instability as DME low-temperature chemistry. This work connects experiment measurements with theoretical analysis of plasma thermal-chemical instability and sheds light on future chemical control of the plasma uniformity.},

 abstract = {Hydroperoxyl (HO2) radicals are an important precursor in the formation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a key species in plasma-liquid interactions, such that their formation and consumption pathways need to be understood. In this work, the generation and decay of HO2 have been studied in a controlled environment, in ns pulse discharge O2–He plasmas in contact with a liquid water surface. For this, time-resolved, absolute number densities of HO2 in O2–He mixtures excited by a repetitive ns pulse discharge are measured in situ by cavity ring down spectroscopy (CRDS). The discharge cell with external electrodes to generate the plasma and a water reservoir are integrated into the CRDS cavity. The high-reflectivity cavity mirrors are purged with helium to protect them from water vapor condensation. The experimental results are obtained at near room temperature, both during the discharge pulse burst and in the afterglow. The HO2 number density is inferred from the CRDS data using a spectral model exhibiting good agreement with previous measurements of absolute HO2 absorption cross sections. HO2 is generated during the discharge burst and decays in the afterglow between the bursts. The HO2 number density is also measured vs. the O2 fraction in the mixture. Comparison with the kinetic modeling predictions demonstrates good agreement with the data and identifies the dominant HO2 generation and decay processes. HO2 in the plasma is formed predominantly by the recombination of H atoms, generated by the electron impact dissociation of water vapor, with O2 molecules. Reactions with O atoms and hydroxyl (OH) radicals are among the main HO2 decay processes in the afterglow. HO2 is also detected when O2 is not present in the mixture. In this case, it is generated primarily by the recombination of OH radicals, via the formation of H2O2. The results demonstrate that CRDS can also be used for HO2 and other plasma chemical reaction product measurements in atmospheric pressure plasma jets impinging on a liquid water surface in ambient air.},

 abstract = {Electric field in a capacitively coupled, non-self-sustained RF discharge nitrogen plasma with external ionization generated by high-voltage ns pulses has been measured by ps Electric field induced second harmonic generation (EFISH). The measurements are made both in the bulk of the plasma and in the sheaths, using the absolute calibration by the Laplacian field between two plane electrodes. The results are compared with the kinetic modeling calculations. The RF electric field in the sheaths is significantly higher compared to that in the plasma, due to the displacement of the electrons by the drift oscillations and the resultant plasma self-shielding. However, the kinetic modeling predictions indicate that the electron impact ionization in the sheaths is largely ineffective, due to the low electron density. The reduction of the electric field in the plasma by the self-shielding in the sheaths is moderate, such that the energy is coupled to the plasma by the below-breakdown RF field. The peak RF field in the plasma is in the range of 15–25 Td, indicating the efficient vibrational excitation of N2 by electron impact. The modeling predictions suggest that the targeted vibrational excitation of molecular species in a non-self-sustained RF discharge with external ionization is scalable to high pressures, electron densities, and discharge powers. The present approach can be extended to the vibrational excitation of other molecular species where the vibrational relaxation is relatively slow, such as CO, CO2, and H2.},

 abstract = {We investigate the electric field development in weak microseconds-lasting atmospheric pressure Townsend discharge operated in a barrier discharge arrangement in pure nitrogen. The electric field is determined using four different methods: laser-aided electric field induced second harmonics (EFISH), optical emission-based first negative/second positive systems (FNS/SPSs of molecular nitrogen) intensity ratio, electrical equivalent circuit approach and via determination of the Townsend first coefficient α(E/N) from the spatial optical emission profile. The resulting values of the electric field obtained by these respective methods, regardless of the differences in absolute values, lie within a reasonable range. The limitations and advantages of all methods are discussed in detail for the investigated discharge. The EFISH measurements are supported by re-computation of the effective interaction-path of the laser using an electrostatic model. The FNS/SPS method provides systematically higher values compared to other methods. We discuss in detail the potential origin of this discrepancy, as this method is at the limit of its applicability due to the low E/N values and we also consider the impossibility of full verification of the underlying assumptions. The focused discussion addresses best-practice issues and identifies possible future steps to improve each of the four methods under given conditions.},

 abstract = {Plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis in a ns pulse discharge and a ‘hybrid’ ns pulse/RF discharge in plane-to-plane geometry is studied by Fourier Transform infrared absorption spectroscopy. The data are taken in a preheated H2–N2 mixture, with and without Ni/γ-Al2O3 or Co/γ-Al2O3 catalyst placed in the discharge section. The measurement results are taken using two different approaches. The first is a ‘single-stage’ process, where a ns pulse discharge in the H2–N2 mixture is sustained continuously. In this case, the ammonia yield increases slowly, over a period of tens of minutes. The second is a ‘two-stage’ process, where the catalyst is first activated by the ns pulse discharge sustained in pure nitrogen, and then the activated catalyst is exposed to the H2–N2 flow, with or without the discharge. In this case, a strong overshoot of the NH3 number density at the reactor exit is detected, by over a factor of two compared to the single-stage process. After the initial overshoot, the ammonia yield gradually decreases to the ‘single stage’ value (with the discharge on), or to near zero (with the discharge off). The results demonstrate that the ammonia yield in the plasma-catalytic reactor is controlled by the N atom accumulation on the catalyst surface, which reacts with H atoms thermally dissociated on the catalyst or generated in the plasma. The results also show that the plasma-catalytic ammonia yield is significantly higher compared to that in the ns pulse discharge without the catalyst. The accumulation of H atoms on the catalyst, with their subsequent reactions with N atoms generated in the plasma, is of relatively minor importance at the present conditions. An additional series of measurements was made with a sub-breakdown RF waveform overlapped with the ns pulse discharge train, to enhance the vibrational excitation of nitrogen. The ammonia yield measured with the RF waveform added is approximately 20% higher compared to that at the baseline ns pulse discharge conditions, both with and without the catalyst. This effect is weaker compared to that of the catalyst activation by N atoms. Additional data are necessary to isolate the possible effect of the vibrationally excited N2 molecules on the ammonia synthesis in the plasma catalytic reactions.},

 abstract = {We used the ns electric field induced second harmonic (EFISH) generation diagnostic to measure the electric field evolution in a 200 ns pulse, dielectric barrier, plane-to-plane discharge in humid air, on the time scale shorter than the laser pulse duration. Plasma imaging by an ICCD camera detected a uniform evolution of the discharge emission during the breakdown. Spectroscopic measurements tracked the N2 second positive and first negative systems to infer the reduced electric field (E/N) evolution. EFISH measurements showed the electric field persistent during the entire HV pulse, with the residual field between pulses and the field inversion at the start and end of the HV pulse. The experimental data are consistent with the simulations, with the electron attachment and negative ion kinetics incorporated. The modeling predictions indicate that the rapid electron density decay due to attachment and recombination is the dominant factor sustaining the electric field in the plasma after breakdown. Spectroscopic E/N determination showed the time evolution at variance with the EFISH measurements, which may be due to the electron attachment and non-locality of the EEDF. Possible explanations are discussed.},

 abstract = {Production of vibrationally excited N2 (N2(v)) in atmospheric pressure nonthermal plasma and loss of N2(v) by gas-phase reactions and reactions on catalytic surfaces are analyzed to examine the role of N2(v) in NH3 formation by plasma catalysis. Vibrational state-to-state kinetic models complemented with molecular beam mass spectrometry (MBMS) measurements demonstrate that N2(v> 0) is produced with densities 100× greater than the density of N radicals by a radiofrequency atmospheric pressure plasma jet. The experimentally measured loss of N2(v) corresponds with a state-to-state kinetic model that describes loss of N2(v) by surface-mediated vibrational relaxation without consideration of reactions that convert N2(v) to NH3 over the catalyst surface. Rate constants for vibrational relaxation of N2(v) on catalyst surfaces exceed upper bounds on proposed rate constants for NH3 formation reactions from N2(v) over Fe when v < 9, Ni when v < 18, and Ag when v < 39, which indicates that only higher vibrational levels can possibly contribute to catalytic NH3 formation faster than they undergo vibrational relaxation on the surface. Densities of N2(v> 8), vibrational levels that can possibly react over Fe to form NH3 faster than they undergo vibrational relaxation, are less than or similar to N densities at the inlet of the catalyst bed and measured NH3 formation for the investigated conditions in this work, while densities of N2(v> 17) and N2(v> 38) are orders of magnitude below the N density at the inlet of the catalyst bed and the measured NH3 formation. The loss of N2(v) by vibrational relaxation on the surface limits the ability of N2(v) to contribute to catalytic NH3 formation and explains why N2(v) does not produce NH3 in quantities that are comparable to NH3 formation from N even though N2(v > 0) is more abundantly produced by the plasma.},

@article{pub.1167168750,
 abstract = {Atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJs) are increasingly being used to functionalize polymers and dielectric materials for biomedical and biotechnology applications. Once such application is microfluidic labs-on-a-chip consisting of dielectric slabs with microchannel grooves hundreds of microns in width and depth. The periodic channels, an example of a complex surface, present challenges in terms of directly and uniformly exposing the surface to the plasma. In this paper, we discuss results from computational and experimental investigations of negative APPJs sustained in Ar/N2 mixtures flowing into ambient air and incident onto a series of microchannels. Results from two-dimensional plasma hydrodynamics modeling are compared to experimental measurements of electric field and fast-camera imaging. The propagation of the plasma across dry microchannels largely consists of a sequence of surface ionization waves (SIWs) on the top ridges of the channels and bulk ionization waves (IWs) crossing over the channels. The IWs are directed into electric field enhanced vertices of the next ridge. The charging of these ridges produce reverse IWs responsible for the majority of the ionization. The propagation of the plasma across water filled microchannels evolve into hopping SIWs between the leading edges of the water channels, regions of electric enhancement due to polarization of the water. Positive, reverse IWs follow the pre-ionized path of the initial negative waves.},

 abstract = {The electric field distribution in the ionization waves (IWs) propagating over a microchannel array dielectric surface, with the channels either empty or filled with distilled water, is measured by ps electric field induced second harmonic generation. The surface IW is initiated by the atmospheric pressure N2–Ar plasma jet impinging on the surface vertically and powered by ns pulse discharge bursts. The results show that the electric field inside the microchannels, specifically its horizontal component, is enhanced by up to a factor of 2. The field enhancement region is localized within the channels. The vertical electric field inside the channels lags in time compared to the field measured at the ridges, indicating the transient reversal of the IW propagation direction across the channels (toward the jet). This is consistent with the phase-locked plasma emission images and confirmed by the kinetic modeling predictions, which show that the IW ‘jumps’ over the empty channels and propagates into the channels only after the jump between the adjacent ridges. When the channels are filled with water, the wave speed increases by up to 50%, due to the higher effective dielectric constant of the surface. No evidence of a significant electric field enhancement near the dielectric surface (ceramic or water) has been detected, within the spatial resolution of the present diagnostic, ∼100 μm.},

@article{pub.1169569628,
 abstract = {The absolute, spatially-resolved, and time-resolved number density of the hydroperoxyl radical is measured in a quasi-two-dimensional, atmospheric pressure ‘curtain’ plasma jet powered by a train of ns discharge pulses. The spatial distribution of HO2 is measured across the shorter dimension of the jet. The measurements are made in two different configurations, (a) H2O–O2–He jet impinging on a copper foil target, and (b) O2–He jet incident on the liquid water surface. In the first configuration, the water vapor is added to the O2–He flow in a bubbler filled with distilled, deionized water. The measurements are made using the previously developed pulsed cavity ring down spectroscopy diagnostic near 1.5 μm. The ring-down cavity is formed between two high-reflectivity mirrors placed at the ends of the stainless steel ‘arms’ purged with dry air, with the plasma jet placed in the gap between the arms. The objectives of this work are to use the HO2 number density to assess the accuracy of the modeling predictions using a previously developed ‘global’ reaction mechanism, and to estimate the efficiency of hydrogen peroxide generation in the ns pulse discharge plasma. HO2 was detected only in the first configuration, most likely due to the rapid decay of the metastable He atoms and O atoms generated in the plasma, which prevents the generation of H atoms (dominant HO2 precursors) in the evaporation/mixing layer. Both the water vapor in the jet and HO2 generated in the plasma have been measured. The results exhibit a rapid accumulation of HO2 during the ns pulse discharge burst, followed by the decay in the afterglow on a ms time scale. The kinetic model overpredicts the quasi-steady-state HO2 number density, as well as the HO2 decay rate after the discharge is turned off. The relatively slow HO2 decay in the afterglow suggests that it may be affected by diffusion, along with the surface adsorption and desorption of radicals. The present approach demonstrates the utility of a 2D curtain plasma jet for the line-of-sight absorption spectroscopy measurements of radicals and excited species present in small concentrations in ambient plasma environments.},

 abstract = {A previously developed semiclassical theory of nonadiabatic energy transfer is used to analyze electronic excitation and quenching in three-dimensional atomic collisions. The predicted transition probabilities, cross sections, and rate coefficients are compared with the quantum scattering calculations for O + O and N + N, for the same interaction potentials and nonadiabatic coupling, and with the experimental data where available. The theory predictions are in very good agreement with quantum scattering, at the conditions when the energy transfer is dominated by a single pair of adiabatic potentials. Closed-form analytic expressions for the cross sections and rate coefficients are obtained, for both the strongly and weakly coupled cases. The results quantify and illustrate the effect of the interaction potentials and their coupling on the energy transfer. The analytic cross sections and rate coefficients are in good agreement with the numerical predictions. The same approach has been used to predict the rate coefficients of electronic excitation and quenching in collisions of N + O atoms. The fidelity of these predictions may be improved considerably if accurate potentials for the excited electronic states of N + O and their coupling are available. The applicability of the semiclassical theory for the prediction of the rates of heavy particle impact excitation in atom-molecule collisions is discussed.},
