 abstract = {The Boltzmann-Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model is investigated for its validity regarding the collision term approximation through relaxation evaluation. The evaluation is based on theoretical analysis and numerical comparison between the BGK and direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) results for three specifically designed relaxation problems. In these problems, one or half component of the velocity distribution is characterized by another Maxwellian distribution with a different temperature. It is analyzed that the relaxation time in the BGK model is unequal to the molecular mean collision time. Relaxation of component distribution fails to involve enough contribution from other component distributions, which makes the BGK model unable to capture details of velocity distribution, especially when discontinuity exists in distribution. The BGK model, however, predicts satisfactory results including fluxes during relaxation when the temperature difference is small. Particularly, the model-induced error in the BGK model increases with the temperature difference, thus the model is more reliable for low-speed rarefied flows than for hypersonic flows.},

 abstract = {A hybrid approach that combines a continuum approach solving the Navier–Stokes equations and a particle method called the information preservation (IP) method is implemented to simulate subsonic, rarefied gas flows accurately and efficiently. The coupling between the continuum and particle approaches relies on a continuum/particle interface, which is investigated in detail. The IP method preserves information at the macroscopic level that allows the continuum approach to directly use the information from the particle region. In order to correctly generate particles from the continuum region, two strategies are proposed. One strategy adopts a Marshak-type condition, which requires many particles in a cell to control the flux fluctuation due to the microscopic motion of particles. In the second strategy, reservoir cells and buffer cells are used, and this is the approach adopted in our general hybrid scheme. The location of the interface is determined using a continuum breakdown parameter. Studies show that the continuum breakdown parameter suggested by Garcia et al. can be used to determine the location of the interface, but the implementation of the interface also affects the location of the interface. Simulation of a flow over a flat plate shows the performance of the hybrid approach and reveals the effects of the cutoff value to a continuum breakdown parameter. This approach is also applied to study the aerodynamics of a micro-scale airfoil, which is very difficult for a single method. The hybrid approach generally spends less computational time than the IP method for rarefied gas flows, and the numerical performance of the hybrid approach depends on the number ratio of continuum cells to particle cells.},

@article{pub.1005710718,
 abstract = {In this work we discuss a novel numerical scheme and present numerical results for the problem of `high' (of order unity) Knudsen number, Kn=λ/L, low velocity gas flow past a micro-plate. The scheme used here is similar to one employed in the past to examine heat flow, but in order to deal with momentum transport in the vicinity of a plate, new techniques had to be developed. These include a new scheme for finding `transition probabilities', which eliminates some forms of numerical diffusion, and a method for handling reflections off surfaces which preserves the essential properties of the flow. The purpose of the paper is to present these methods and examine their performance. The method is found to function well, but the results indicate that the collision operator which is employed here must be improved in order to obtain accurate results for the drag. Low speed neutral particle transport, in long mean free path (LMFP) environments, presents challenges for well-established techniques, such as the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. In particular, at low flow velocities, statistical methods suffer from noise that may render them impractical in LMFP environments. Solution of the Boltzmann equation is the alternative to these statistical methods. As computing power increases, Boltzmann-based approaches become more accessible. We discuss here a novel non-statistical (no random numbers are used) kinetic model for particle transport and explore its accuracy and sensitivity to resolution and other details of its implementation. The model is an enhanced version of the transition probability matrix (TPM) method. The results generated by the TPM are compared with the information preservation (IP) method, the Navier–Stokes (NS) slip model and when applicable to DSMC. We provide a qualitative comparison of the models and then we compare the results of the different models for various Kn for flow past a plate. For Kn in the slip flow regime, the TPM, IP and NS models exhibit similar flow features. As the Kn passes through the transitional regime, the TPM and IP results are quantitatively similar, while the NS model fails to adequately describe the flows. For Kn in the free molecular regime, we compare the TPM to an analytic approximation to flow past a flat plate; the TPM and analytic solution exhibit similar characteristics. The drag coefficient is in agreement in the two cases, although it is sensitive to the angular distribution employed in the collision operator, when particles are relaunched after collisions.},

 abstract = {In this paper, the problem of near continuum gas flows over a sphere is investigated numerically. Three types of boundary conditions for the sphere surface are adopted: (1) non-slip and constant temperature surface; (2) velocity slip with considerations of velocity gradient, and temperature jump at the surface; and (3) velocity slip with considerations of both velocity and temperature gradients, as well as temperature jump at the surface. Navier–Stokes equations in a cylindrical coordinate system for compressible flows are adopted with the Roe numerical scheme. The numerical simulation results include coefficient distributions for surface pressure, friction, heat flux, velocity slip, temperature jump and total drag. The results are obtained with different free stream Knudsen and Mach numbers. Several conclusions include: (i) the third surface boundary condition does not create significant differences from the second type, (ii) however, an adoption of non-slip or a slip surface boundary condition can create significant differences in Cf,Cq and CD.},

This can find applications in studying similar transient plume flows from space propulsion devices. Different from many past studies, here we consider the general situation that the average exit gas speed can be larger than zero, and detailed geometry of the nozzle exit radius is included. A fundamental space–velocity–time relation is adopted in this study and it plays a crucial role to obtain the complete flowfield properties of density, velocity, pressure and temperature. This study reveals that there are some internal complementary relations on density and momentum among these three processes. The results involve complex integrations involving factors of time, geometry, and specific speed ratio. Several numerical simulations with the direct simulation Monte Carlo method validate these analytical exact results.},

 abstract = {This study proposes a quasi-one-dimensional model to predict the chemical non-equilibrium flow along the stagnation streamline of hypersonic flow past a blunt body. The model solves reduced equations along the stagnation streamline and predicts nearly identical results as the numerical solution of the full-field Navier-Stokes equations. The high efficiency of this model makes it useful to investigate the overall quantitative behavior of related physical-chemical phenomena. In this paper two important properties of hypersonic flow, shock stand-off distance and oxygen dissociation, are studied using the quasi-one-dimensional model with the ideal dissociating gas model. It is found that the shock stand-off distance is affected by both chemical and thermal non-equilibrium. The shock stand-off distance will increase when the flow conditions are changed from equilibrium to non-equilibrium, because the average density of the shock-compressed gas will decrease as a result of the increase in translational energy. For oxygen dissociation, the maximum value of its dissociation degree along the stagnation line varies with the flight altitude. It is increased at first and decreased thereafter with the altitude, which is due to the combination effect of the equilibrium shift and chemical non-equilibrium relaxation. The overall variation of the maximum dissociation is then plotted in the speed and altitude coordinates as a reference for engineering application.},

 abstract = {Microscale gas flows are the subject of increasingly active research due to the rapid advances in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). The rarefied phenomena in MEMS gas flows make molecular-based simulations desirable. However, it is necessary to reduce the statistical scatter in particle methods for microscale gas flows. In this paper, the development of an information preservation (IP) method is described. The IP method reduces the statistical scatter by preserving macroscopic information of the flow in the particles and the computational cells simulated in the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. The preserved macroscopic information of particles is updated during collisions and is then modified to include the pressure field effects excluded in the collisions. An additional energy transfer model is proposed to describe the energy flux across an interface, and a collision model is used to redistribute the information after both particle–particle and particle–surface collisions. To validate the IP method, four different flows are simulated and the solutions are compared against DSMC results. The results from the IP method generally agree very well with the DSMC results for steady flows and low frequency unsteady flows ranging from the near-continuum regime to the free-molecular regime.},

 abstract = {Fluid dynamic equations are valid in their respective modeling scales, such as the particle mean free path scale of the Boltzmann equation and the hydrodynamic scale of the Navier–Stokes (NS) equations. With a variation of the modeling scales, theoretically there should have a continuous spectrum of fluid dynamic equations. Even though the Boltzmann equation is claimed to be valid in all scales, many Boltzmann solvers, including direct simulation Monte Carlo method, require the cell resolution to the order of particle mean free path scale. Therefore, they are still single scale methods. In order to study multiscale flow evolution efficiently, the dynamics in the computational fluid has to be changed with the scales. A direct modeling of flow physics with a changeable scale may become an appropriate approach. The unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) is a direct modeling method in the mesh size scale, and its underlying flow physics depends on the resolution of the cell size relative to the particle mean free path. The cell size of UGKS is not limited by the particle mean free path. With the variation of the ratio between the numerical cell size and local particle mean free path, the UGKS recovers the flow dynamics from the particle transport and collision in the kinetic scale to the wave propagation in the hydrodynamic scale. The previous UGKS is mostly constructed from the evolution solution of kinetic model equations. Even though the UGKS is very accurate and effective in the low transition and continuum flow regimes with the time step being much larger than the particle mean free time, it still has space to develop more accurate flow solver in the region, where the time step is comparable with the local particle mean free time. In such a scale, there is dynamic difference from the full Boltzmann collision term and the model equations. This work is about the further development of the UGKS with the implementation of the full Boltzmann collision term in the region where it is needed. The central ingredient of the UGKS is the coupled treatment of particle transport and collision in the flux evaluation across a cell interface, where a continuous flow dynamics from kinetic to hydrodynamic scales is modeled. The newly developed UGKS has the asymptotic preserving (AP) property of recovering the NS solutions in the continuum flow regime, and the full Boltzmann solution in the rarefied regime. In the mostly unexplored transition regime, the UGKS itself provides a valuable tool for the non-equilibrium flow study. The mathematical properties of the scheme, such as stability, accuracy, and the asymptotic preserving, will be analyzed in this paper as well.},

First, by comparing the magnitudes of different forces in the compressible gas flow, we obtain proper estimations for the Reynolds and Mach numbers at the outlets. Second, based on these estimations, we obtain asymptotic analytical solutions of velocities, pressure and temperature distributions of compressible gas flow inside the microchannels and microtubes with a relaxation of the isothermal assumption, which was previously used in many studies. Numerical simulations of compressible flows through a microchannel and a microtube are performed by solving the compressible Navier–Stokes equations, with velocity slip and temperature jump wall boundary conditions. The numerical simulation results validate the analytical results from this study.

Studies have shown that such low Reynolds number flow exhibits rarefied phenomena and a flat plate having a thickness ratio of 5% has better aerodynamic performance than conventional streamlined airfoils. This paper simulates air flows over a 5% flat plate using a hybrid continuum–particle approach for flows having a Mach number of 0.2 and a Reynolds number varying between 1 and 200. Investigation shows that low Reynolds number flows are viscous and compressible, and rarefied effects increase when the Reynolds number decreases. It is also found that there is a minimum lift slope for the plate airfoil at a Reynolds number near 10 and the drag coefficient monotonically increases with decreasing Reynolds number.},

 abstract = {Spacecraft propulsion systems, such as Hall thrusters, are designed and tested in large vacuum chambers. The pumping capacity of modern facilities makes it possible to maintain pressures as low as 10−3–10−4Pa. One fundamental concern for the vacuum chamber is the facility effects on the chamber performance. In this study, several free molecular models are developed to analyze the rarefied background flow inside a vacuum chamber equipped with two-sided vacuum pumps. These models lead to various sets of analytical results including velocity distribution functions for the background flow and formulas to compute the vacuum pump sticking coefficient. These results can be used to evaluate the performance of vacuum chambers and to aid constructing proper background flows for particle simulations of these systems. The results indicate that the background flow conditions can have a significant nonzero mean velocity and cannot be considered to be described by a Maxwellian velocity distribution. The models are applied to analyze the rarefied background flow in a specific vacuum chamber. Calculations of the sticking coefficient for flow of xenon in the vacuum chamber yield values close to 0.40 for cryogenic pumps. Several modifications of the background flow treatment for particle simulations are proposed with the aid of these analytical results.},

 abstract = {Gas flow over a micro cylinder is simulated using both a compressible Navier-Stokes solver and a hybrid continuum/particle approach. The micro cylinder flow has low Reynolds number because of the small length scale and the low speed, which also indicates that the rarefied gas effect exists in the flow. A cylinder having a diameter of 20 microns is simulated under several flow conditions where the Reynolds number ranges from 2 to 50 and the Mach number varies from 0.1 to 0.8. It is found that the low Reynolds number flow can be compressible even when the Mach number is less than 0.3, and the drag coefficient of the cylinder increases when the Reynolds number decreases. The compressible effect will increase the pressure drag coefficient although the friction coefficient remains nearly unchanged. The rarefied gas effect will reduce both the friction and pressure drag coefficients, and the vortex in the flow may be shrunk or even disappear.Copyright © 2009 by ASME},

It is learned that local rarefaction is observed near the leading edge even when the Knudsen number is around 0.001. The continuum breakdown can be identified using a nonequilibrium parameter that evaluates the difference among the temperature components. It is also learned that there is competition between viscous effects and rarefied effects on the skin friction. The total drag on the plate can be well estimated using a bridging formula that connects the results from the continuum and free molecular expressions. In addition, the value of drag depends on the surface temperature.

It is found that physical processes such as vibrational excitation and chemical reaction will reduce significantly the shock stand-off distance and flow temperature for flows having small Knudsen number. The calculated skin friction and surface heat flux will decrease when the real gas effects are considered in simulations. The trend, however, gets weakened as the Knudsen number increases.

In this work, several factors affecting the heat loss in the coaxial cylinders are studied using the DSMC method, including the wall thermal accommodation coefficient, wall temperature, gas composition, and number density of the gas mixture. After determining argon as the filling gas, the effect of different combinations of the argon and hydrogen densities on the heat flux was studied, and an empirical formula was proposed to evaluate the heat flux of the Ar-H2 mixture.},

 abstract = {Shock waves propagating in shock tubes or small channels will be constantly attenuated during propagation due to viscous effect and wall heat conduction. The physical mechanism of this attenuation process has not been clearly discussed in the literature although many investigations have studied the laws and extent of shock wave attenuation under various initial conditions. In this work, the DSMC method is employed to study the propagation and attenuation of shock waves in a 2D planar tube. Numerical results show that the thickness of the unsteady velocity boundary layer in the shock coordinate increases nearly proportional to the square root of time whereas the disturbance of wall effects propagates approximately with the sound velocity behind the shock wave. Appreciable shock curvature is clearly seen in the shock wave and boundary layer interaction corner, which is found to be oscillated. Further analysis shows that the oscillation characteristic of the shock profile is caused by the periodic propagation of low-pressure disturbance generated from the wall surface. Finally, shock wave is found to be more severely attenuated in narrower tube or having larger Mach number at the same time moments.},

In present study, one-dimensional H2-O2 detonation is numerically investigated through DSMC method. The detailed balance between forward and reverse reactions is achieved through a modified reaction model, which improves the simulation accuracy of combustion system. Results show that the overall structure of detonation is in accordance with the CFD result, but the microscopic fluctuation of auto-ignition affects detonation in both initiation and propagation stages. Analysis of the detailed structure in the induction zone shows that the auto-ignition process is strongly coupled with the vibrational relaxation process. The lower vibrational temperature decreases the chemical reaction rates, resulting in an increase of ignition delay time and induction zone length.},

 abstract = {A stagnation streamline model incorporating quantum-state-resolved chemistry is proposed to study hypersonic nonequilibrium flows along the stagnation streamline. This model is developed by reducing the full Navier–Stokes equations to the stagnation streamline with proper approximations for equation closure. The thermochemical nonequilibrium is described by either the state-to-state approach for detailed analysis or conventional two-temperature models for comparison purpose. The model is validated against various data, and nearly identical results are obtained as compared with those from full field computational fluid dynamics data. In addition, the calculated distributions agree well with the measurement data of a shock tube experiment for the dissociation and vibrational relaxation of O2, including the distributions of species mole fractions and vibrational temperature of the first excited state of O2 molecules. Furthermore, the results with the state-resolved chemistry show that the flow within a shock layer exhibits a strong thermochemical nonequilibrium behavior, which is beyond the capability of commonly used two-temperature models to correctly evaluate the dissociation rate and the associated reaction energy. The present model is also employed to calculate the nonequilibrium re-entry flow along the stagnation streamline for a five-species air mixture as an example to demonstrate the model capability. It is found that both species and internal energy are in a nonequilibrium state, especially the vibrational distributions are strongly deviated from the Boltzmann distribution right behind the bow shock and near the wall surface. The results demonstrate that the proposed stagnation streamline model is very useful to understand thermochemical nonequilibrium phenomena in hypersonic flows.},

The combination of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver and reduced-order model is utilized to calculate the aerodynamics of elastic aircraft. CFD is applied to the aerodynamic solution of rigid motion, and reduced-order model is to the elastic deformation. The governing equations of rigid-body dynamics and structure dynamics are decoupled in time-scale, and their time step sizes can be set differently. This method overcomes the problem of large difference in characteristic times between rigid-body dynamics and structure dynamics, and improves the calculation efficiency of CFD based multi-disciplinary coupling solution. For current work, the multi-time scale kinetics solution method is applied to the simulation of store separation problem considering elastic deformation of carrier aircraft. The autoregressive with exogenous input model is employed to establish the generalized aerodynamic model of carrier. By comparison, the time responses of store obtained by the multi-time scale kinetics solution method are in good agreement with those by traditional CFD based multi-disciplinary coupling simulation, which validates high precision of the new method. Furthermore, the calculation amount of the new coupled calculation method is reduced by about an order of magnitude compared with that of the traditional method. The multi-time scale kinetics solution method can provide an effective solution strategy for similar engineering problems.},

In order to generate particles from the continuum side, two strategies are proposed. The first one uses a condition similar to the Marshak condition in generating particles through the interface. The second strategy adopts buffer cells and reservoir cells, which avoids directly generating particles. The interface is determined by a continuum breakdown parameter that is evaluated in every time step. In order to track the interface, a mapping technique is used in the code. Numerical examples show that the hybrid approach couples the continuum solver and the particle method very smoothly.

The results are generated using an enhanced version of the transition probability matrix (TPM) method. The TPM is a non‐statistical kinetic method [1] for computing neutral particle transport in high Knudsen number flows. The problem of high Knudsen number, low Mach number gas flow has been studied in the past using several computational approaches, such as the Information Preservation (IP) method [2] and the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method [2]. For low Mach numbers, the DSMC approach suffers from statistical noise [3]. The IP method extends the range of the particle method by reducing the statistical noise of the approach. The need for a method which is capable of describing the particle distribution function for high Knudsen number flows at low flow velocities has led to an investigation of alternative kinetic approaches, such as the IP[4]. In this paper we present an altogether different approach to the problem of statistical noise, the transition probability matrix (TPM) method [1, 5, 6, 7]. We give a brief overview of the TPM method, and compare its strengths and weaknesses to those of the IP and DSMC methods. Finally, we present results for the micro‐plate and compare them to the results generated by both the IP and DSMC methods.},

In this study, a large cell DSMC scheme is proposed to relax the cell size restriction. The scheme is applied to simulate several test problems and promising results are obtained even when the cell size is greater than 10 mean free paths of gas molecules.

Two-dimensional base-flow simulations indicate that the onset of incipient and secondary separation is insensitive to the inclusion of thermochemistry, although the size of the separation region is substantially reduced. GSA is then performed on the base flows and identifies a three-dimensional stationary global instability beyond a critical aft angle, which is also insensitive to thermochemical nonequilibrium. The criterion of the global stability boundary established for the supersonic flow over compression corners in a calorically perfect gas in terms of a scaled deflection angle [Hao et al., “Occurrence of global instability in hypersonic compression corner flow,” J. Fluid Mech. 919, A4 (2021)] is, thus, extended to high-enthalpy conditions.},

 abstract = {In a recent communication [2021 Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 23 15475–79] we showed that the correct modelling of vibrational quenching events in O + N2(v) collisions, a fundamental process in air plasmas, requires the detailed representation of intermediate and asymptotic regions of the interaction and the inclusion of several types of processes as vibration to translation (V–T) and vibro-electronic (V–E) energy transfer. For the first time from the publication of experimental results in the 70’s, we obtained theoretical results in agreement with experiments, even at room temperature. In the present work we extend the approach to better describe non-adiabatic V–E deactivation and include the evaluation of the role of the higher excited singlet N2O surface, characterized by new high quality ab initio calculations, to that of the triplet Π and Σ ones. Within this framework, we calculate V–T, V–E and the corresponding total vibrational relaxation rate coefficients for initial vibrational N2(v) quantum numbers up to v = 10 in a wide temperature range (200–10 000 K). These data are of uttermost importance for the modelling of air plasmas, of earth’s and planetary atmospheres and for the design and construction of aircrafts and air-breathing propulsion systems for very low earth orbit (VLEO) satellites.},

The fitting function adopted the many-body expansion form with the four-body interactions fitted by the permutationally invariant polynomial in terms of bond-order functions of the six interatomic distances (MB-PIP). In this work, we refit the PES of the N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> system by two methods based on the same data set that was used by Varga et al. The first uses the permutation invariant polynomial-neural network (PIP-NN) method to fit the entire energy of the 55,000 data points. In the second approach, the PIP-NN method is used to fit only the four-body interaction component, a similar treatment in the MB-PIP method, and the resulting PES is named MB-PIP-NN. Then, the performances of these new PESs and the MB-PIP PES are comprehensively and systematically compared, such as comparisons of various scans, properties of stationary points, and dynamics simulations. Possible improvements for the PES of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are suggested. A more reliable PES of the system can be constructed in terms of data sampling range, electronic structure calculation level, and fitting method for high-temperature calculation and simulation in the future.},

These data are needed for the modelling of discharges in N2$$_2$$/H2$$_2$$ plasma or of atmospheric and interstellar medium chemistry in different temperature ranges.

In addition, we present a detailed, though preliminary, analysis on the performance of different Machine Learning models based on the Gaussian Process or Neural Network techniques to produce complete datasets of inelastic scattering rate coefficients. Eventually, by using the selected models, we give the complete dataset (i.e., covering the whole vibrational ladder) of rate coefficients for the N2(v)+H2(0)⟶N2(v-Δv)+H2(0)$$\textrm{N}_2(v)+\textrm{H}_2(0) \longrightarrow \textrm{N}_2(v-\Delta v)+\textrm{H}_2(0)$$, Δv=1,2,3$$\Delta v=1,2,3$$ processes.Graphical abstract},

 abstract = {The hypersonic flow is in a thermochemical nonequilibrium state due to the high-temperature caused by the strong shock compression. In a thermochemical nonequilibrium flow, the distribution of molecular internal energy levels strongly deviates from the equilibrium distribution (i.e., the Boltzmann distribution). It is intractable to directly obtain the microscopic nonequilibrium distribution from existed experimental measurements usually described by macroscopic field variables such as temperature or velocity. Motivated by the idea of deep multi-scale multi-physics neural network (DeepMMNet) proposed in [1], we develop in this paper a data assimilation framework called DeepStSNet to accurately reconstruct the quantum state-resolved thermochemical nonequilibrium flowfield by using sparse experimental measurements of vibrational temperature and pre-trained deep neural operator networks (DeepONets). In particular, we first construct several DeepONets to express the coupled dynamics between field variables in the thermochemical nonequilibrium flow and to approximate the state-to-state (StS) approach, which traces the variation of each vibrational level of molecule accurately. These proposed DeepONets are then trained by using the numerical simulation data, and would later be served as building blocks for the DeepStSNet. We demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of DeepONets with different test cases showing that the density and energy of vibrational groups as well as the temperature and velocity fields are predicted with high accuracy. We then extend the architectures of DeepMMNet by considering a simplified thermochemical nonequilibrium model, i.e., the 2T model, showing that the entire thermochemical nonequilibrium flowfield is well predicted by using scattered measurements of full or even partial field variables. We next consider a more accurate and complex thermochemical nonequilibrium model, i.e., the StS-CGM model, and develop a DeepStSNet for this model. In this case, we employ the coarse-grained method, which divides the vibrational levels into groups (vibrational bins), to alleviate the computational cost for the StS approach in order to achieve a fast but reliable prediction with DeepStSNet. We test the present DeepStSNet framework with sparse numerical simulation data showing that the predictions are in excellent agreement with the reference data for test cases. We further employ the DeepStSNet to assimilate a few experimental measurements of vibrational temperature obtained from the shock tube experiment, and the detailed non-Boltzmann vibrational distribution of molecule oxygen is reconstructed by using the sparse experimental data for the first time. Moreover, by considering the inevitable uncertainty in the experimental data, an average strategy in the predicting procedure is proposed to obtain the most probable predicted fields. The present DeepStSNet is general and robust, and can be applied to build a bridge from sparse measurements of macroscopic field variables to a microscopic quantum state-resolved flowfield. This kind of reconstruction is beneficial for exploiting the experimental measurements and uncovering the hidden physicochemical processes in hypersonic flows.},

 abstract = {A hybrid stochastic simulation method is developed to study H2-O2 auto-ignition at the microscale. Simulation results show that the discrete and stochastic characteristics of reaction collisions have notable impacts on the ignition process, particularly in the early stages when only a few radicals exist. The statistical properties of ignition delay time, which reflect the accumulated stochasticity during ignition, are obtained and analyzed for different initial temperatures and total molecular numbers. It is found that the average and standard deviation of ignition delay time increase as the total molecular number decreases, with this phenomenon being particularly pronounced near the crossover temperature. When the total molecular number is sufficiently small, the chain initiation reaction becomes crucial to the stochastic properties, as its average firing time exhibits an inverse proportionality to the total molecular number. As the total molecular number increases, the influence of other chain reactions intensifies, causing the power law relation between standard deviation and total molecular number to shift from -1 power to -0.5 power. Owing to different chain reaction paths for high- and low-temperature auto-ignition, the strongest relative fluctuation occurs near the crossover temperature. A theoretical equation for the standard deviation of ignition delay time is obtained based on dimensional analysis, giving excellent agreement with the simulation results in both high- and low-temperature modes.},

 abstract = {The current work presents the collision integral data for N(4 S)–N(4 S, 2 D, 2 P) and O(3 P, 1 D, 1 S)–O(3 P, 1 D, 1 S) interactions in the temperature range of 500–50 000 K. The collision integrals are calculated based on high-quality potential energy curves (PECs) obtained from fitting the high-level ab initio calculation data in a wide energy range to the neural network (NN) functions. In the construction of PECs, the diabatic PECs are adopted when avoided crossings exist because the diabatic paths are much more likely to be followed for such situations. Moreover, the nonadiabatic transition effects are estimated to be negligible for PECs crossings. The accuracy of traditional analytical formulas to fit PECs are also examined. It is found that the collision integral calculations are sensitive to the accuracy of PECs and the NN based PECs overwhelm the others. The contribution of inelastic excitation exchange processes to the diffusion collision integrals are also computed by using an accurate evaluation of the differences of PECs for gerade and ungerade pairs of excited atoms. Finally, based on the new collision integral data, we calibrate the collision model parameters suitable for the widely used particle simulation methods. The collision integrals and collision models developed in this work can be used to support high-confidence simulations of weakly ionized air plasma problems.},

To reach this goal, we improved a mixed quantum-classical (MQC) dynamics approach by lifting the constraint of a Morse treatment of the vibrational wave function and intramolecular potential and permitting the use of more realistic and flexible representations. The new formulation has also allowed us to separately analyze the role of intra- and intermolecular potentials on the calculated rates and properties. <i>Ab initio</i> intramolecular potentials are indispensable for highly excited vibrational states, though the Morse potential still gives reasonable values up to <i>v</i> = 20. An accurate description of the long-range interaction and the van der Waals well is a requisite for the correct reproduction of qualitative and quantitative rate coefficients, particularly at low temperatures, making physically meaningful analytical representations still the best choice compared to currently available <i>ab initio</i> potential energy surfaces. These settings were used to directly compute the MQC rates corresponding to a large number of initial vibrational quantum numbers, and the missing intermediate values were predicted using a machine learning technique (<i>i.e.</i>, the Gaussian process regression approach).

 abstract = {The time-dependent rotational and vibrational temperatures were measured to study the shock-heated thermal nonequilibrium behaviors of CO with Ar, He, and H2 as collision partners. Three interference-free transition lines in the fundamental vibrational band of CO were applied to the fast, in situ, and state-specific measurements. Vibrational relaxation times of CO were summarized over a temperature range of 1110-2820 K behind reflected shocks. The measured rotational temperature instantaneously reached an equilibrium state behind shock waves. The measured vibrational temperature experienced a relaxation process before reaching the equilibrium state. The measured vibrational temperature time histories were compared with predictions based on the Landau-Teller model and the state-to-state approach. The state-to-state approach treats the vibrational energy levels of CO as pseudo-species and accurately describes the detailed thermal nonequilibrium processes behind shock waves. The datasets of state-specific inelastic rate coefficients of CO-Ar, CO-He, CO-CO, and CO-H2 collisions were calculated in this study using the mixed quantum-classical method and the semiclassical forced harmonic oscillator model. The predictions based on the state-to-state approach agreed well with the measured data and nonequilibrium (non-Boltzmann) vibrational distributions were found in the post-shock regions, while the Landau-Teller model predicted slower vibrational temperature time histories than the measured data. Modifications were applied to the Millikan-White vibrational relaxation data of the CO-Ar and CO-H2 systems to improve the performance of the Landau-Teller model. In addition, the thermal nonequilibrium processes behind incident shocks, the acceleration effects of H2O on the relaxation process of CO, and the characterization of vibrational temperature were highlighted.},

Phys. 153, 054310 (2020)] and analytical long-range multipolar interactions. This merged PES offers a double advantage: it retains the precision of the ab initio PES in describing the van der Waals well and repulsive short range while providing an accurate physical description of long-range interaction; it significantly reduces the computational time required for trajectory integration since the long-range portion of the ab initio PES (involving numerous neural network fitting parameters) is now replaced by the analytical model potential. Based on the present merged PES, mixed Quantum-Classical (MQC) calculations, which capture quantum effects related to vibrational motion, align with a range of experimental data, including transport properties, vibrational energy transfer between CO and its isotoplogues, as well as rate coefficients for V-V and V-T/R processes. Notably, the original ab initio PES yields V-T/R rate coefficients at low temperatures that are significantly higher than the experimental data due to the artificial contribution of its unphysical long-range potential. In addition to conducting extensive MQC calculations to obtain raw data for V-V and V-T/R rate coefficients, we employ Gaussian process regression to predict processes lacking computed MQC data, thereby completing the considered V-V and V-T/R datasets. These extensive rate coefficient datasets, particularly for V-T/R processes, are unprecedented and reveal the significant role played by V-T/R processes at high temperatures, emphasizing the necessity of incorporating both V-V and V-T/R processes in the applications.},

A laser absorption technique was applied to the time-dependent rovibrational temperature time-history measurements. The vibrational relaxation data of reflected-shock-heated CO were summarized at 1720-3230 K. In shock-tube experiments, the rotational temperature of CO quickly reached equilibrium, whereas a relaxation process was found in the time-dependent vibrational temperature. For the mixture with 1.0% CO and 10.0% N2, the vibrational excitation caused a decrease in the macroscopic thermodynamic temperature of the test gas. In the simulations, the state-to-state (StS) approach was employed, where the vibrational energy levels of CO and N2 are treated as pseudo-species. The vibrational state-specific inelastic rate coefficients of N2-Ar collisions were calculated using the mixed quantum-classical method based on a newly developed three-dimensional potential energy surface. The StS predictions agreed well with the measurements, whereas deviations were found between the Schwartz-Slawsky-Herzfeld formula predictions and the measurements. The Millikan-White vibrational relaxation data of the N2-Ar system were found to have the most significant impact on the model predictions via sensitivity analysis. The vibrational relaxation data of the N2-Ar system were then modified according to the experimental data and StS results, providing an indirect way to optimize the vibrational relaxation data of a specific system.
