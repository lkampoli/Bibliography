 abstract = {The successful development of hypersonic vehicles requires a detailed knowledge of the flow physics around the vehicle. The physics knowledge and modeling confidence drives the development of the major vehicle flight systems including the thermal protection system and flight control system. Specifically, an understanding of the thermochemical nonequilibrium behavior is crucial for this flight regime. The hypersonic flight regime involves an extremely high level of energy so a small error in the modeling of the energy processes can result in drastic changes in the vehicle design, including prohibitive design requirements. This emphasizes the need for a deep understanding of the underlying flow phenomena and molecular energy transfer processes in order to adequately design a hypersonic vehicle computationally.},

 abstract = {The thermochemical nonequilibrium of the three lowest lying electronic states of molecular oxygen, O2(X3Σg-,a1Δg,b1Σg+), through interactions with argon is studied in the present work. The multi-body potential energy surfaces of O2+Ar are evaluated from the semi-classical RKR potential of O2 in each electronic state. The rovibrational states and energies of each electronic state are calculated by the quantum mechanical method based on the present inter-nuclear potential of O2. Then, the complete sets of the rovibrational state-to-state transition rate coefficients of O2+Ar are calculated by the quasi-classical trajectory method including the quasi-bound states. The system of master equations constructed by the present state-to-state transition rate coefficients are solved to analyze the thermochemical nonequilibrium of O2+Ar in various heat bath conditions. From these studies, it is concluded that the vibrational relaxation and coupled chemical reactions of each electronic state needs to be treated as a separate nonequilibrium process, and rotational nonequilibrium needs to be considered at translational temperatures above 10,000K.},

For the accurate simulation of N2 and H2 collisions and rotation-translation transition, a variable soft-sphere model and a recent rotational relaxation model of N2 and H2 were used. For the investigation of the interaction between thrust plume and base region, the number density distribution for each species, translational and rotational temperature distributions, heat flux, and pressure were examined by direct simulation of Monte-Carlo calculations. It was found that most of the surface properties are affected by H2 collisions and a strong non-equilibrium state is observed at the base region. It was demonstrated that an accurate model is needed to simulate H2 collisions and the rotation-translation transition. The results by the present calculation are more accurate than previous direct simulation Monte-Carlo calculations because more accurate rotational relaxation models were used in simulating the inelastic collisions.},

 abstract = {In the present study, modification and expansion of the collision parameters for the general soft-sphere model [J. Fan, Phys. Fluids 12, 4399 (2002)] were made for use in the direct simulation Monte Carlo calculation of hypersonic flows in the temperature range of 300–50 000K. The collision integrals were expressed as a two-term function in a form of the inverse power of temperature, which was cast in terms of the soft-sphere scattering parameters and the four total cross-section parameters. Next, the most recent available data for the diffusion and viscosity collision integrals were collected and fitted into a function of temperature in the same form. By equating these expressions for the diffusion and viscosity collision integrals simultaneously, the five collision parameters were deduced as functions of species combinations. The resulting collision parameters for the general soft-sphere model were tabulated for 191 collision pairs involving 22 species. It was shown that the transport properties calculated by using the present collision parameters are much closer to experiments, theoretical data, and the values obtained by the ab initio calculations from quantum-mechanically derived potential energy surfaces than existing elastic collision models. The direct simulation Monte Carlo calculation of flow around a circular cylinder confirmed that discernible differences exist between the results based on the present study and those of the existing models.},

 abstract = {State-resolved analyses of N + N2 are performed using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. In describing the elastic collisions by a state-resolved method, a state-specific total cross section is proposed. The state-resolved method is constructed from the state-specific total cross section and the rovibrational state-to-state transition cross sections for bound-bound and bound-free transitions taken from a NASA database. This approach makes it possible to analyze the rotational-to-translational, vibrational-to-translational, and rotational-to-vibrational energy transfers and the chemical reactions without relying on macroscopic properties and phenomenological models. In nonequilibrium heat bath calculations, the results of present state-resolved DSMC calculations are validated with those of the master equation calculations and the existing shock-tube experimental data for bound-bound and bound-free transitions. In various equilibrium and nonequilibrium heat bath conditions and 2D cylindrical flows, the DSMC calculations by the state-resolved method are compared with those obtained with previous phenomenological DSMC models. In these previous DSMC models, the variable soft sphere, phenomenological Larsen-Borgnakke, quantum kinetic, and total collision energy models are considered. From these studies, it is concluded that the state-resolved method can accurately describe the rotational-to-translational, vibrational-to-translational, and rotational-to-vibrational transfers and quasi-steady state of rotational and vibrational energies in nonequilibrium chemical reactions by state-to-state kinetics.},

 abstract = {Temperature determination in a shock tube is one of the most important factors to understand the relevant flow physics inside. In the present study, the reservoir temperature determination in a shock tube using the ultraviolet emission spectra of hydroxyl radical (OH) A-X band was carried out. A radiation model for the OH A-X transition was developed, and it was validated using the benchmark data. Curve fit parameters, such as a peak-to-peak ratio and the absolute peak intensity of the P-branch, are proposed to evaluate the rotational temperature and the OH number density from the measured emission spectra. In the shock tube experiments, humid air from the atmosphere was employed as a test gas, and a small amount of the ultraviolet OH emission was measured behind the reflected shock wave. The measured spectrum was converted to the rotational temperature and the number density using the present model of the OH A-X emission. Then, the evaluated rotational temperature was compared with the calculated values of the reservoir condition behind the reflected shock wave. A good agreement was detected between the measured and the calculated temperatures, which are 4020 ± 290 K and 4110 ± 220 K, respectively. It was recognized that the reservoir temperature behind the reflected shock wave is well described by the present model of the OH A-X ultraviolet emission.},

 abstract = {Ablative thermal protection system (TPS) has been used to protect a vehicle from the heat load experienced during hypersonic or re-entry flights. Typical materials for ablative TPS are carbon–carbon (C/C) composites and carbon–phenolic composites, which have generally been used at working temperatures that are not very high due to surface oxidation. From a material science perspective, modification with ultra-high-temperature ceramic (UHTC) materials or coating with UHTC materials have been undertaken in an attempt to enhance the performance of ablative TPSs for high-temperature applications. As no single facility can reproduce all the aspects of the harsh environments that a vehicle would experience in hypersonic flight, a facility appropriate for the environment of interest is selectively adopted to assess TPS materials. In this study, an evaluation system for ablative material in a high-temperature torch has been developed. As part of the development, cost-effective experiments were conducted using an oxy-kerosene torch. Performance of the C/C test sample was measured, and the flowfield was diagnosed. Numerical simulation of the oxy-kerosene flowfield and the one-dimensional material response have been performed and compared with the test data.},

 abstract = {In the present study, three different electronic state-to-state methods are proposed to analyze nonequilibrium air plasma flows behind a strong shock wave. In the first approach representing the conventional method, a two-temperature model combined with the electronic quasi-steady-state assumption is adopted. In the second and the third methods, atomic and molecular electronic master equations are coupled with a conservation equation to describe the electronic state-to-state kinetics. State-of-the-art electronic transition rates for atmospheric gas species are compiled with comparisons of existing data. A prediction of the measured nonequilibrium radiation is made for the flow conditions of recent electric-arc shock tube experiments. In a comparison with the measured spectrum, the present electronic master equation coupling methods are more accurate than the conventional approach when used to estimate the initial rising rate and peak value of the diatomic intensity and small amounts of atomic radiation when the diatomic nonequilibrium condition is dominant. Moreover, the spatial distributions of the intensity and electron number density are more accurately predicted by the present methods when the flow fields are dominated by atomic nonequilibrium.},

Required rotational state-to-state cross section is obtained by an atomistic quasi-classical trajectory method. To reduce computational cost drastically, the rotational and vibrational states are separated, and the vibrational states are assumed to be in a Boltzmann distribution. The present rotational relaxation time, determined from the state-resolved master equation analysis for the temperatures of 10,000 K, 20,000 K, and 32,000 K, is discernibly different with the existing data. The postshock nonequilibrium radiation prediction is then made to apply the present rotational relaxation time to a typical Earth reentry condition, and the calculated intensity profiles are in good agreement with the shock tube experimental data.},

 abstract = { The present work analyzes the stagnation-point radiative heating in the Fire II flight experiment by devising a collisional-radiative model with non-local absorption. In the stagnation-line flow-field calculations, a viscous shock layer method with a thermochemical nonequilibrium model is utilized. In the radiation calculations, a line-by-line method with the non-Boltzmann electronic populations is employed by adopting the quasi-steady state approach of the electronic master equation calculations. In constructing the electronic master equation, the best set of the electron and heavy-particle impact excitation rates is proposed to achieve better agreement with the measured radiative heating flight data. In the flow-radiation coupling procedure, the effect of the non-local absorption is modeled by devising an iterative process between the quasi-steady state electronic master equation and the radiative transfer equation calculations. Escape factors of the strongest atomic lines and the diatomic nitrogen vacuum ultraviolet systems with the non-local absorption effect are also proposed to more efficiently consider the non-local nature of the radiative transition. When compared with the experimental data from the Fire II trajectories, it is found that the present collisional-radiative model with the non-local absorption improves the ability to predict non-Boltzmann radiative heating.},

 abstract = {Investigation of surface recombination activity of nitrogen on certain materials is crucial in the design of hypersonic re-entry vehicles. In the present work, an experimental study using a conventional shock tube facility has been conducted to investigate the phenomena of nitrogen recombination. Stagnation heat-transfer measurements were conducted behind reflected shock waves in a dissociated shock-tube flow for a mixture of 20% nitrogen and 80% argon. A platinum thin-film gauge was used to measure the stagnation heat-transfer in a shock heated gas mixture under a well-defined test condition. The surface of the heat-transfer gauge was coated with silicon dioxide (SiO2), the principal material used in thermal protection systems (TPS) for the hypersonic vehicles. Spectroscopic analyses were performed for in-depth characterization of the initial surface condition of the test specimen. Recombination activity behavior of nitrogen was evaluated by combining the heat-transfer data with catalytic heat transfer theories. The nitrogen recombination efficiency of silicon dioxide is found to be from 0.0026 to 0.035 at surface roughness factors of 1.01 to 1.10. Compared to the oxygen recombination activity, the nitrogen recombination activity showed a more than five times higher sensitivity to the roughness factor of the SiO2-coated surface.},

 abstract = {A thermochemical nonequilibrium analysis was performed under the low enthalpy shock-tunnel flows. A quasi-one-dimensional flow calculation was employed by dividing the flow calculations into two parts, for the shock-tube and the Mach 6 nozzle. To describe the thermochemical nonequilibrium of the low enthalpy shock-tunnel flows, a three-temperature model is proposed. The three-temperature model treats the vibrational nonequilibrium of O2 and NO separately from the single nonequilibrium energy mode of the previous two-temperature model. In the three-temperature model, electron-electronic energies and vibrational energy of N2 are grouped as one energy mode, and vibrational energies of O2, O2+, and NO are grouped as another energy mode. The results for the shock-tunnel flows calculated using the three-temperature model were then compared with existing experimental data and the results obtained from one- and two-temperature models, for various operating conditions of the K1 shock-tunnel facility. The results of the thermochemical nonequilibrium analysis of the low enthalpy shock-tunnel flows suggest that the nonequilibrium characteristics of N2 and O2 need to be treated separately. The vibrational relaxation of O2 is much faster than that of N2 in low enthalpy condition, and the dissociation rate of O2 is manly influenced by the species vibrational temperature of O2. The proposed three-temperature model is able to describe the thermochemical nonequilibrium characteristics of N2 and O2 behind the incident and reflected shock waves, and the rapid vibrational freezing of N2 in nozzle expanding flows.},

 abstract = {The ablation performance of carbon–carbon composites depends on the environment in which the ablation occurs. At temperatures below 3000 K$$K$$, the ablation performance of carbon–carbon composites is determined by oxidation, and so it is not sufficient to describe the environment only in terms of surface heat flux, which is the criteria that has typically been adopted for test conditions in ground tests. In this study, the effects of surface temperature and oxygen mass flux on the ablation of carbon–carbon composites were investigated, since they are key factors in the oxidation of carbon–carbon composites. Oxy-kerosene torch experiments were conducted under two surface temperature conditions, of about 1700 K$$K$$ and 2600 K$$K$$, and with three equivalence ratio conditions. The experimental results were then numerically reconstructed through a coupled analysis of oxy-kerosene torch flow-field modelling, surface thermochemistry, and gas-surface interaction. The effects of surface temperature and oxygen mass flux on the ablation of carbon–carbon composites were analyzed in terms of the mass ablation rate, surface heat flux, and morphology. It was determined that the mass ablation rate is proportional to the increase in oxygen mass flux, even when the surface heat flux and surface temperature were similar. The proportion of heat flux reduction by ablation heat flux was proportional to the increase in oxygen mass flux, and the contribution of oxygen mass flux to the ablation heat flux was enhanced under high surface temperature conditions. Depending on surface temperature and oxygen mass flux, a flat-shape fiber was observed in the morphology analyses, unlike the typical needle-shaped fiber.},

 abstract = {The rotational relaxation time of an air mixture is modified as an approach to improve accuracy when predicting hypersonic shock standoff distance. A novel atomistic quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) method with a modified approach is devised to drastically reduce computational cost, and rigorously model the rotational relaxation time of N2 in N2–N and N2–N2 collisions. The calculated full sets of rotational state-to-state transition rates obtained by the QCT method are fed into the rotational state-resolved master equations to determine the rotational relaxation time of N2. Clear discrepancies are observed when the present rotational relaxation time is compared with existing empirical data for N2. The existing empirical model is utilized to determine the rotational relaxation time of other atmospheric gas species. Then the present set of rotational relaxation times for the air mixture is employed to predict the hypersonic shock standoff distance over a blunt body of the ground and flight experiments. Compared with the results from the two-temperature model, the rotational nonequilibrium enlarges the hypersonic shock standoff distance. This increase in shock standoff distance by the rotational nonequilibrium is attributed to the delay in chemical reactions inside the shock layers. The accuracy of the predicted measured shock standoff distance is improved by considering the present rotational relaxation time of the air mixture.},

The two-temperature model is employed to describe the thermochemical nonequilibrium flows of the OREX flight conditions. The state-of-art chemical-kinetic parameters of 19-species, including the air and carbon-related ablation gas species, are assessed and utilized to calculate the re-entry flows. In gas–surface interactions, three types of ablation models, the fully equilibrium model, Park model, and surface thermochemistry model of the Zhluktov–Abe and Prata models, are employed to describe the ablation on the surface of carbon–carbon composite CC material of the thermal protection system. For the selected trajectory points of the OREX flight conditions, quasi-one-dimensional thermochemical nonequilibrium flow calculations are carried out, and the results are analyzed in detail. From the calculated results of the re-entry flows, it was found that the production of CO, CO2, and CN is the dominant mechanism of the surface heating on the ablating surface. Heat loss by surface recession is relatively small in OREX flight conditions. The total amount of surface recession due to ablation is approximately 0.22–0.32 mm in the selected range of the OREX flight. Heat loss from surface radiation increases with the surface temperature, and the amount of heat loss is comparable to the amount of surface heating at the trajectory point of 7481.5 s in the OREX flight.},

Three flow conditions with different flow enthalpy in a gas mixture that contains 21% oxygen and 79% argon are considered. The recombination efficiency is determined based on the stagnation heat transfer measurement at the end-wall of the shock tube. A copper-coated platinum thin-film gauge is used to determine the total stagnation heat transfer. An additional silicon dioxide-coated platinum thin film gauge is applied to measure the conductive heat transfer. Catalytic heat transfer theories based on binary and tertiary gas mixtures are applied to obtain the oxygen catalytic recombination efficiency and the corresponding atomic wall fraction. The oxygen atomic wall partial pressure is computed based on the oxygen atomic wall mass fraction which varies according to the surface catalysis. By combining theoretical and stagnation heat transfer measurement, the oxygen recombination efficiency on copper material is found to be between 0.0022 and 0.0213 as the oxygen atomic wall partial pressure decreases from 25.62 kPa to 13.41 kPa. The results observed in the present work confirm that the wall partial pressure influences the oxygen recombination efficiency.},

The effect of varying the suction flow ratio on the shock train oscillatory characteristics is analyzed using steady and unsteady statistics, space–time contour, power spectra, and cross correlation analysis. For the present study, a constant area duct of height 0.032 mm, and the aspect ratio of 25, at freestream Mach number of 2.0 and back pressure ratio of 0.52 is considered. The removal of the boundary layer through an angled suction slot with three different suction flow ratios is performed. Numerical results indicate that the removal boundary layer restricts the bifurcation process of the shock train and appears to be a single curved normal shock at a higher suction flow ratio. Also, the transition of regular reflection to the Mach reflection type is noted. The suction flow from the top and bottom slot tends to initiate a lateral oscillation that forms a wavy mixing flow region. The power spectral density contour suggests that the increase in suction flow ratio will tend to increase the dominant frequency ranges from (0.034 to 0.094). The cross correlation indicates the presence of downstream pressure disturbance that moves toward the upstream direction. With suction flow, a disturbance that emerges from the suction slot moves in the opposite direction and dominates at a lower suction flow ratio and these disturbances disappear at a large suction flow ratio.},

                    Purpose
                    The Fay and Riddell (F–R) formula is an empirical equation for estimating the stagnation-point heat flux on noncatalytic and fully catalytic surfaces, based on an assumption of equilibrium. Because of its simplicity, the F–R has been used extensively for reentry flight design as well as ground test facility applications. This study aims to investigate the uncertainties of the F-R formula by considering velocity gradient, chemical species at the boundary layer edge, and the thermochemical nonequilibrium (NEQ) behind the shock layer under various hypersonic NEQ flow environments.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    The stagnation-point heat flux calculated with the F–R formula was evaluated by comparison with thermochemical NEQ calculations and existing flight experimental values.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The comparisons showed that the F–R underestimated the noncatalytic heat flux, because of the chemical composition at the surface. However, for fully catalytic heat flux, the F–R results were similar to values of surface heat flux from thermochemical NEQ calculations, because the F–R formula overestimates the diffusive heat flux. When compared with the surface heat flux results obtained from flight experimental data, the F–R overestimated the fully catalytic heat flux. The error was 50% at most.
                  
                  
                    Originality/value
                    The results provided guidelines for the F–R calculations under hypersonic flight conditions and for determining the approximate error range for noncatalytic and fully catalytic surfaces.

The prediction of ablation gas production is critical for heat flux prediction and the design of a thermal protection system. In this study, we present a system that measures the number density of CO2 formed by the gas–surface interaction between a hot carbon surface and high-temperature gas. The heated carbon wall is exposed to high-temperature air by using a shock tube and surface heating model. The surface temperature of the carbon wall is measured using two-color ratio pyrometry. The number density of CO2 is predicted by performing numerical calculations for the shock tube flow with gas–surface interaction modeling. The number density of CO2 molecules is measured using infrared emission spectroscopy. The measured CO2 number density is 9.60 × 1023 m−3 at an area-weighted average surface temperature of 1212 K. The measured number density matches the predicted value within an error of 6%. The proposed system is applicable for CO2 number density measurement under various gas–surface interaction conditions, and it can be used for the investigation of ablative gas production and numerical research on gas–surface interactions.},

 abstract = {This work constructs a rovibrational state-to-state model for the
$\text{O}_2$+$\text{O}_2$ system leveraging high-fidelity potential energy
surfaces and quasi-classical trajectory calculations. The model is used to
investigate internal energy transfer and non-equilibrium reactive processes in
dissociating environment using a master equation approach, whereby the kinetics
of each internal rovibrational state is explicitly computed. To cope with the
exponentially large number of elementary processes that characterize reactive
bimolecular collisions, the internal states of the collision partner are
assumed to follow a Boltzmann distribution at a prescribed internal
temperature. This procedure makes the problem tractable, reducing the
computational cost to a comparable scale with the $\text{O}_2$+O system. The
constructed rovibrational-specific kinetic database covers the temperature
range of 7500-20000 K. The analysis of the energy transfer and dissociation
process in isochoric and isothermal conditions reveals that significant
departures from the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution occur during the energy
transfer and dissociation phase. Comparing the population distribution of the
$\text{O}_2$ molecules against the $\text{O}_2$+O demonstrates a more
significant extent of non-equilibrium characterized by a more diffuse
distribution whereby the vibrational strands are more clearly identifiable.
This is partly due to a less efficient mixing of the rovibrational states,
which results in more diffuse rovibrational distributions in the
quasi-steady-state distribution. The master equation analysis for the combined
$\text{O}_3$+$\text{O}_4$ system reveals that the $\text{O}_2$+$\text{O}_2$
governs the early stage of energy transfer, while the $\text{O}_2$+O takes
control of the dissociation dynamics. The findings will provide strong physical
foundations for future development of oxygen chemistry.},

 abstract = {The interaction between the self-excited shock train flow and the cavity shear layer in a scramjet isolator is investigated numerically using detached-eddy simulations. The effect of changing the position of the shock train by controlling the back pressure ratio and the effect of changing the cavity front wall angle are analyzed using unsteady statistics and modal analysis. The propagation mechanism of the pressure disturbance was investigated by spatiotemporal cross-correlation coefficient analysis. In the present numerical study, a constant isolator section with a cavity front wall (θ = 90° and 60°) was considered, followed by a diffuser section simulated at Mach number 2.2 with three different back pressure ratios (pb/p∞ = 0.7, 5.0, and 6.0). The change in back pressure provides three different conditions (i.e., no shock train, shock train ends before the leading edge of the cavity, and shock train present above the cavity). To understand the unsteady dynamics of the interaction of the shear layer with the shock train, the spatiotemporal trajectory of the wall pressure and the centerline pressure distribution, the spatiotemporal cross-correlation coefficient, and the modal analysis by dynamic mode decomposition are obtained. The results show that the low-frequency shock train oscillation dominates the self-sustained cavity oscillation. The spatiotemporal cross-correlation between the wall surface and the center of the cavity bottom wall indicates the propagation of local disturbances originating from the separated boundary layer caused by the shock and the recirculation zone in the corners of the cavity. Dynamic mode decomposition analysis shows the shear layer at the leading edge of the cavity and the downstream propagation of large eddies from the cavity. It also shows the pairing of coherent structures between the shock train and the recirculation zone of the cavity.},
