The method is based on the idea of combining a multitude of atomic energy levels into two or three grouped levels. Dimensionless formulation suitable for practical calculations is presented. Application to real systems shows that two grouped levels are enough to model hydrogen-like and noble gas atoms, whereas three grouped levels are required to describe atoms with low lying excited states. Two methods for the calculation of degeneracy and energy values of the grouped levels are investigated. Representative mono-atomic LTE plasma properties calculations are reported. The results agree with accurate computations using partition functions that include several thousands energy levels.},

The model has been applied to study the response to UV or soft X-ray radiation of diamond and silicon, focused on the case of two-layer material made of diamond film grown on silicon. Typically the statistical distribution of the electron–hole cascade is macroscopically parameterized by the mean energy required to create an electron–hole pair W and the Fano factor F. The results for the pure materials are in agreement with the values present in the literature. Moreover we found an enhancement of the Fano factor and a super-Poissonian behaviour of the statistical distribution of the pairs, typical of correlated systems.},

It is shown that the plasma optical thickness plays a major role on the evolution of macroscopic quantities and internal distributions along the nozzle axis. Structured electron energy distribution functions, characterized by long plateaux and humps, are created due to superelastic collisions of cold electrons and electronically excited atomic hydrogen. The magnitudes of the plateaux are orders of magnitude higher in an optically thick plasma compared with a thin plasma, while the electron-electron collisions play a role in smoothing the peaks created by superelastic collisions between cold electrons and H(n>2).},

 abstract = {A Monte Carlo method has been developed for the calculation of binary diffusion coefficients in gas mixtures. The method is based on the stochastic solution of the linear Boltzmann equation obtained for the transport of one component in a thermal bath of the second one. Anisotropic scattering is included by calculating the classical deflection angle in binary collisions under isotropic potential. Model results are compared to accurate solutions of the Chapman–Enskog equation in the first and higher orders. We have selected two different cases, H2 in H2 and O in O2, assuming rigid spheres or using a model phenomenological potential. Diffusion coefficients, calculated in the proposed approach, are found in close agreement with Chapman–Enskog results in all the cases considered, the deviations being reduced using higher order approximations.},

A system of two coupled time-dependent Boltzmann equations, describing electron and phonon dynamics, has been numerically solved. In the electron Boltzmann equation, electron–electron and electron–phonon collision integrals are considered together with a source term for laser perturbation. In the phonon Boltzmann equation, only electron–phonon collisions are considered, neglecting laser perturbation and phonon–phonon collisions. Screening of the interactions has been accounted for in both the electron–electron and the electron–phonon collisions. The results show the simultaneous electron and phonon time-dependent distributions from the initial non-equilibrium behaviour up to the establishment of a new final equilibrium condition.},

These aspects are first illustrated in the case of a 0-dimensional model considering both optically thin and optically thick cases in recombining and ionizing regimes. In the second part of the paper, a 1-dimensional extension of the model is applied to study a steady normal shock generated in an H2/He plasma of interest in atmospheric entry problems. A radiation transfer equation is coupled to the model as well, to analyze the effect of radiation transfer on chemical kinetics and compare to the commonly used thin and thick plasma approximations. The most significant result is the influence of reabsorption on the concentration of excited states, which in turn creates additional structure on the electron energy distribution function through second kind collisions.},

The specific heat of the diatomic species presents a maximum followed by a steep decrease towards zero. This effect, which is usually not reported in standard textbooks of statistical thermodynamics, is a direct consequence of the finite number of energy levels accounted for in the internal partition function.

 abstract = {In this work a low-temperature plasma source for the generation of plasma activated water (PAW) is developed and characterized. The plasma reactor was operated by means of an atmospheric-pressure air dielectric barrier discharge (DBD). The plasma generated is in contact with the water surface and is able to chemically activate the liquid medium. Electrodes were supplied by both sinusoidal and nanosecond-pulsed voltage waveforms. Treatment times were varied from 2 to 12 min to increase the energy dose released to the water by the DBD plasma. The physics of the discharge was studied by means of electrical, spectroscopic and imaging diagnostics. The interaction between the plasma and the liquid was investigated as well. Temperature and composition of the treated water were detected. Images of the discharges showed a filamentary behaviour in the sinusoidal case and a more homogeneous behaviour in the nanosecond-pulsed one. The images and the electrical measurements allowed to evaluate an average electron number density of about 4 × 1019 and 6 × 1017 m−3 for the sinusoidal and nanosecond-pulsed discharges respectively. Electron temperatures in the range of 2.1÷2.6 eV were measured by using spectroscopic diagnostics. Rotational temperatures in the range of 318–475 K were estimated by fitting synthetic spectra with the measured ones. Water temperature and pH level did not change significantly after the exposure to the DBD plasma. The production of ozone and hydrogen peroxide within the water was enhanced by increasing the plasma treatment time and the energy dose. Numerical simulations of the nanosecond-pulsed discharge were performed by using a self-consistent coupling of state-to-state kinetics of the air mixture with the Boltzmann equation of free electron kinetics. Temporal evolution of the electron energy distribution function shows departure from the Maxwellian distribution especially during the afterglow phase of the discharge. When limited deviations from Maxwellian distribution were observed, calculated electron temperature is in good agreement with the one measured by means of spectroscopic diagnostics. Computed temporal evolution of the energy delivered to the discharge is comparable with the one obtained from electrical measurements. The electrical discharges supplied by both voltage waveforms produce plasma activated water with negligible thermal effects and pH variations.},

 abstract = {IntroductionThe research on high-energy shock wave is a field of large interest including nuclear explosion, hypersonic flows as well as laser forming plasmas. During the relevant interaction a high-temperature, high-pressure plasma is formed, which in some cases can be ascribed to the family of thermal plasmas, characterized by equilibrium between the different degrees of freedom, including chemical and internal ones. Thermal plasmas can be described by equilibrium chemical thermodynamics, in particular statistical thermodynamics is used in this field to get information about the input data (entropy, enthalpy and specific heat of single species). Thermal plasmas are usually characterized by a single temperature for all species, including the vibrationally, rotationally and electronically distributions among the excited states, while dissociation and ionization (Saha) equilibria characterize them. On the other hand thermal plasmas with different temperatures are still accepted in this kind of literature, the different temperatures characterizing the corresponding reservoirs of energy. The internal distributions are still Boltzmann at a given (different) temperature; chemical equilibrium thermodynamics again characterizes the plasma properties even though caution must be exercised in using it. Typical conditions for thermal plasmas are temperatures in the range of 5 000-50 000 K, pressure in the 10− 2-103 atm. range and ionization degree larger than 10− 5.},

 abstract = {The space exploration is nowadays assisted by realistic modeling of re-entry conditions of space vehicles in planetary atmospheres, for the design of thermal protection systems. The detailed kinetic modeling relies on the accurate description of elementary process dynamics, including the role of the excitation of the internal degrees of freedom of chemical species. Efforts in the construction of a complete and consistent dynamical information are presented, focusing on hydrogen plasmas relevant to the Jupiter atmosphere. Examples of numerical experiments are given, emphasizing the relevance of the adopted state-to-state approach in reproducing the onset of non-equilibrium internal distributions governing the plasma system evolution.},

 abstract = {Thermal and chemical nonequilibrium effects are investigated in hypersonic nozzle expanding flows by means of vibrational collisional models. The rate coefficients for rovibrational dissociation and excitation are provided by two chemical databases for the N + N2 system recently developed at NASA Ames Research Center and the University of Bari. Vibrationally averaged rate coefficients for N + N2 collisions are computed based on the hypothesis of equilibrium between translational and rotational modes. N2 + N2 collisions are also considered based on literature data. Inviscid and quasi 1D governing equations are discretized in space by means of a finite volume method. A fully implicit time integration method is applied to obtain steady state solutions. Results show that, for both N + N2 and N2 + N2 collision dominated flows, the populations of vibrational levels deviate from a Boltzmann distribution. An accurate investigation of vibrational level dynamics shows the different behavior of low and high-lying states. Comparison against experimental data acquired at the EAST facility of NASA Ames Research Center demonstrate good agreement between the computed and experimental results.},

 abstract = {The role of electronic excited states in affecting the thermodynamic and transport properties of thermal plasma is investigated in the temperature range [300–100 000 K] and in the pressure range [1–103 atm] for hydrogen and [10−2–103 atm] for nitrogen. Thermodynamic functions have been calculated modelling in different ways the electronic levels of atomic species (ground-state, Debye–Hückel and confined-atom approximations). Frozen and reactive specific heats as well as isentropic coefficients are strongly affected by the electronic excitation whereas compensation effects smooth its influence on the total specific heat, i.e. the sum of frozen and reactive contributions. Higher-order approximations of the Chapman–Enskog method have been used to evaluate transport coefficients, including electronically excited states as separate species. The importance of a state-to-state approach to calculate transport coefficients is presented taking into account the strong dependence of transport cross sections on the principal quantum number. Results for hydrogen, nitrogen and air plasmas are widely discussed.},

metal film heated by femto-pico second laser pulses have been discussed. The 
traditional two-temperature approach reveals to be inaccurate due to 
deviations of electrons and phonons from Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein 
distributions, respectively. Coupled Boltzmann kinetic equations have been 
adapted for the quantum statistics to study the energy distribution of 
electrons and phonons in metals. Theoretical details have been discussed and 
a new solution method has been proposed overcoming numerical problems and 
improving stability, allowing the study of the dynamics until the complete

A total number of 1683 scorable bands was obtained but only polymorphic bands (932) were considered in this work. The variation of the genetic distances, in relation to an increasing number of bands, was evaluated through a bootstrap sampling procedure. The mean coefficient of variation (CV) of the genetic distances decreased as the number of bands increased. A CV of 10% was obtained with about 100–150 bands while a CV of 5% with a large number of bands (400–500 and over). To reduce the cost and the time of the analyses, primers with different levels of polymorphism were compared. Genetic distance matrices, based on different numbers of bands and primer polymorphism, were highly correlated with the genetic distance matrix of the whole data set when they were determined with a large number of RAPD fragments, either from high or low polymorphic primers. The effect of the number of bands on the estimation of genetic distances was evaluated also through the variation of the pattern of aggregation among genotypes (cluster analysis). Stable clusterings were detected when a large number of polymorphic bands (400 and over) was used. Some rearrangements of the genotypes in the dendrograms was observed as the number of bands decreased; below 100–150 bands the clusterings were completely rearranged.},

Phonon–phonon (p–p) collisions have been neglected. The collision probability of each process is derived by quantum-mechanical first order perturbation theory. The injected laser energy (source term) is directly absorbed by the electron gas through electron–photon collisions and a perturbation term is added to the Boltzmann equation for electrons. However, phonons do not directly absorb energy from the laser but they are affected by the irradiation due to their collisional interaction with electrons. The results emphasize the transient non-equilibrium behavior of the electron distribution function and details of electron and phonon relaxation dynamics.},

Three diastereomers, two in head-to-tail (DeltaHT and LambdaHT) and one in head-to-head (HH) conformations, exist in equilibrium in solution. The two guanines are equivalent in DeltaHT and LambdaHT conformers and nonequivalent in the HH form; therefore, four rate constants (k(Delta)(HT), k(Lambda)(HT), k(HH)()s, and k(HH)()d; sub-subscripts s and d stand for H8-shielded and -deshielded guanine, respectively) were evaluated. Activation parameters (DeltaH and DeltaS) were evaluated from the rate constant dependence on temperature. High values of DeltaH (78-93 kJ mol(-)(1)) and DeltaS (51-71 J K(-)(1) mol(-)(1)) were found for G rotation in the preferred DeltaHT rotamer having the six-membered ring of each guanine more canted toward the cis-G and a favorable dipole-dipole internucleotide interaction. Lower values of DeltaH() (64-76 kJ mol(-)(1)) and very small values of DeltaS() (-7-11 J K(-)(1) mol(-)(1)) were found for G rotation in the less favorable LambdaHT rotamer, indicating that the ground-state entropy of this rotamer is close to that of the activated complex and the ground-state enthalpy closer to that of the activated complex than for the DeltaHT rotamer. For the two guanines in the HH rotamer there is no large difference in activation parameters. In general DeltaH falls in the range 66-84 kJ mol(-)(1) (rather close to the values for the LambdaHT rotamer) and DeltaS in the range 14-41 J K(-)(1) mol(-)(1). The equilibrium constant between HT and HH rotamers was also evaluated together with the corresponding thermodynamic parameters (DeltaH and DeltaS). It is found that the low enthalpy is the major stabilizing factor for DeltaHT as compared to HH, while the entropy factor would favor the latter rotamer. In contrast the greater entropy is the stabilizing factor for the LambdaHT rotamer (the second most abundant conformer for 9-EtG and 3'-GMP) over the HH rotamer. In the latter case the enthalpy would favor the HH rotamer. In the case of the 5'-GMP derivative the greater entropy of the LambdaHT rotamer is not such to compensate for the lower enthalpy of the HH rotamer, and the latter remains the second most abundant rotamer. This investigation has allowed for the first time the enthalpic and entropic contributions favoring different rotamers to be distinguished.},

The total specific heat of the plasma (the sum of frozen and reactive contributions) is less affected due to compensation effects.

 abstract = {A simplified method to calculate the electronic partition functions and the corresponding thermodynamic properties of atomic species is presented and applied to C(I) up to C(VI) ions. The method consists in reducing the complex structure of an atom to three lumped levels. The ground level of the lumped model describes the ground term of the real atom, while the second lumped level represents the low lying states and the last one groups all the other atomic levels. It is also shown that for the purpose of thermodynamic function calculation, the energy and the statistical weight of the upper lumped level, describing high-lying excited atomic states, can be satisfactorily approximated by an analytic hydrogenlike formula. The results of the simplified method are in good agreement with those obtained by direct summation over a complete set (i.e., including all possible terms and configurations below a given cutoff energy) of atomic energy levels. The method can be generalized to include more lumped levels in order to improve the accuracy.},

 abstract = {This paper describes the results of an experimental investigation on the effect of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) interaction with the plasma of the shock layer at a test body in a hypersonic argon flow. The hypersonic flow is obtained from the high-enthalpy arc-heated wind tunnel of Alta, Pisa, Italy, on Mach 6. Tests are carried out at heating chamber stagnation pressures of 0.65, 0.85, and 1 bar and magnetic fields of 0.15-0.35 T. The experimental observations are done by means of a set of electrical probes, an optical multichannel analyzer, and a fast shutter charge-coupled device camera. In order to maximize the effect of MHD interaction, the Faraday field is shorted, and a magnetic field perpendicular to the test body surface is used. An increase of the distance between the shock front and the body, owing to the MHD interaction, is observed. The MHD interaction effect is reduced by the low conductivity of the plasma in the boundary layer at the test body surface.},

 abstract = {A self-consistent time dependent model, based on the coupling between the Boltzmann equation for free electrons, the non equilibrium vibrational kinetics for the asymmetric mode of CO2 and simplified global models for the dissociation and ionization plasma chemistry, has been applied to conditions which can be met under pulsed microwave (MW), dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) and nanosecond pulsed discharges (NPD). Under MW discharge type conditions, the selected pulse duration generates large concentration of vibrational excited states, which affects the electron energy distribution function (eedf) through the superelastic vibrational collisions. Moreover, in discharge conditions, plateaux appear in the vibrational distribution function (vdf) through the vibrational–vibrational up pumping mechanism, persisting also in the post discharge. In post discharge conditions, also the eedf is characterized by plateaux due to the superelastic collisions between cold electrons and the CO2 electronic state at 10.5 eV. The plateau in vdf increases the dissociation of pure vibrational mechanism (PVM), which can become competitive with the dissociation mechanism induced by electron molecule collisions. The PVM rates increase with the decrease of gas temperature, generating a non-Arrhenius behaviour. The situation completely changes under DBD and NPD type conditions characterized by shorter pulse duration and higher applied E/N values. Under discharge conditions, both vdf and eedf plateaux disappear, reappering in the afterglow.},

The accuracy of the two thermochemical non-equilibrium models was assessed by comparing the results with experimental findings, showing better predictions provided by the state-to-state approach. To overcome the huge computational cost of the state-to-state model, a multiple-nodes GPU implementation, based on an MPI-CUDA approach, was employed and a comprehensive code performance analysis is presented. Both the pure MPI-CPU and the MPI-CUDA implementations exhibit excellent scalability performance. GPUs outperform CPUs computing especially when the state-to-state approach is employed, showing speed-ups, of the single GPU with respect to the single-core CPU, larger than 100 in both the case of one MPI process and multiple MPI process.},

For this purpose we have developed a state to state kinetic model to study the dissociation of ammonia in supersonic nozzle expansion. The properties of the thruster depend on the ammonia dissociation degree in the reservoir, which can be very far from equilibrium due to the very slow dissociation kinetics at the thruster working conditions (<2000 K). We have extended the calculation for higher temperatures (>2500 K) where ammonia dissociation is higher. Due to the presence of some hydrogen atoms, non- Boltzmann distributions have been observed.},

 abstract = {Non-equilibrium plasma kinetics of reacting CO for conditions typically met in microwave discharges have been developed based on the coupling of excited state kinetics and the Boltzmann equation for the electron energy distribution function (EEDF). Particular attention is given to the insertion in the vibrational kinetics of a complete set of electron molecule resonant processes linking the whole vibrational ladder of the CO molecule, as well as to the role of Boudouard reaction, i.e. the process of forming CO2 by two vibrationally excited CO molecules, in shaping the vibrational distribution of CO and promoting reaction channels assisted by vibrational excitation (pure vibrational mechanisms, PVM). PVM mechanisms can become competitive with electron impact dissociation processes (DEM) in the activation of CO. A case study reproducing the conditions of a microwave discharge has been considered following the coupled kinetics also in the post discharge conditions. Results include the evolution of EEDF in discharge and post discharge conditions highlighting the role of superelastic vibrational and electronic collisions in shaping the EEDF. Moreover, PVM rate coefficients and DEM ones are studied as a function of gas temperature, showing a non-Arrhenius behavior, i.e. the rate coefficients increase with decreasing gas temperature as a result of a vibrational–vibrational (V–V) pumping up mechanism able to form plateaux in the vibrational distribution function. The accuracy of the results is discussed in particular in connection to the present knowledge of the activation energy of the Boudouard process.},

 abstract = {Abstract
The evolution of atmospheric pressure hydrogen plasma under the action of repetitively ns electrical pulse has been investigated using a 0D state-to-state kinetic model that self-consistently couples the master equation of heavy particles and the Boltzmann equation for free electrons. The kinetic model includes, together with atomic hydrogen states and the vibrational kinetics of H2 ground state, vibrational levels of singlet states, accounting for the collisional quenching, having a relevant role because of the high pressure. The mechanisms of excitations, radiative decay and collisional quenching involving the excited H2 states and the corresponding cross sections, integrated over the non-equilibrium electron energy distribution function (EEDF) to obtain kinetic rates, are discussed in the light of the kinetic simulation results, i.e. the time evolution during the pulse of the plasma composition, of the EEDF and of the vibrational distributions of ground and singlet excited states.

 abstract = {This paper presents the results of a revised calculation of the thermodynamic properties and transport coefficients presented by Capitelli et al. (see Eur. Phys. J. D., vol.11, p.279-89 (2000)) for high temperature air. The calculations, which assume local thermodynamic equilibrium, are performed for different pressures (from. 001 to 1000 atm) in the temperature range from 50 to 30000 K. The results have been obtained by means of higher Chapman-Enskog approximations after an appropriate selection of the collision integrals. The calculations include viscosity, total thermal conductivity and electric conductivity. Internal partition functions tabulated by Giordano et al. (1994) and a recent compilation of collision integrals obtained by Capitelli et al. (2000) have been used to calculate plasma composition, thermodynamic properties and transport coefficients. A new efficient method developed by the authors has been used to calculate the equilibrium composition of the gas. The collision integrals used in calculating the transport coefficients are significantly more accurate than values used in previous theoretical studies. In particular, accurate collision integrals, carried out by Mason (1967 and 1971), for interactions between charged species were calculated using the attractive and repulsive screened Coulomb potentials with quantum-mechanical corrections. The results are compared with experimental and theoretical values. Analytical expression for all transport coefficients and thermodynamic parameters are also reported.},

 abstract = {Nanosecond repetitively pulsed (NRP) atmospheric discharges in reacting CO mixtures have been investigated by considering different case studies obtained by changing the interpulse delay time (t id) in the range 1–25 μs and the gas temperature in the range 500–2000 K. Molar fractions of neutral and ionized particles, including free electrons as well as electron energy distribution (eedf) and vibrational distribution (vdf) functions, have been discussed by solving an appropriate Boltzmann equation and a sophisticated state-to-state vibrational kinetics of CO coupled with a simplified plasma-chemistry, describing the most important chemical species including electronic excited states. Large deviations of eedf from the Maxwell distributions are observed, especially at low t id values, as a result of superelastic electronic collisions (SEC) acting in post-discharge and mainly involving CO electronic excited states. Numerous peaks are observed in the eedf because the present study deals with so-called optically thick plasmas when radiative emission is totally reabsorbed. Non-equilibrium vdf are also observed, with plateaux tending to decrease with an increase in gas temperature, which weakens the V–V up pumping mechanism.},

 abstract = {The non-equilibrium vibrational distributions and electron energy distributions of CO in nanosecond repetitively pulsed discharges and afterglows have been determined from a coupled solution of the time-dependent Boltzmann equation for the electron energy distribution function (eedf) of free electrons, the master equations for vibrational levels of CO and the electronic excited states of CO, O and C atoms. The optically thick plasma conditions have been investigated in a companion paper (part I), while in the present paper we also show the results obtained by allowing radiative emission processes (optically thin plasma) as well as electronic excited state collisional quenching processes. Two case studies, which differ for the duration of the afterglow following each pulse (1 μs and 25 μs case studies) are discussed, and each pulse is characterized by a time-dependent electric field profile in the range 0–20 ns. The results, which depend on the number of pulses considered in the discharge and the corresponding afterglow duration, show several peaks in the eedf due to super-elastic electronic collisions. On the other hand, the quenching process of the a 3Π electronic state of CO determines the pumping of vibrational quanta in the v = 27 level, which in turn largely modifies the vibrational distribution function (vdf) of CO. As a consequence, the quenching of the a 3Π state increases the reactivity of CO through the Boudouard reaction, and under given conditions, this channel can become more important than the dissociation rates by electron impact collisions.},

Emphasis is given to the role of dissociative electron attachment (DEA) from vibrationally excited states in affecting the eedf and vdf under extreme conditions, i.e., an optically thick plasma with quenching processes involving the electronic excited states, populated by a sequence of discharge pulses and corresponding afterglows. In particular, the quenching process of the a<sup>3</sup>Π electronic state of CO determines a pumping of vibrational quanta in the ground state, which in turn largely modifies the CO vdf promoting the activation of DEA process. DEA rate coefficients have been obtained by using a complete set of vibrational (v) dependent cross sections through the <i>CO</i> <sup>-</sup>(<i>X</i> <sup>2</sup>Π) channel and by using the experimental <i>v</i> = 0 cross section of Rapp and Briglia, which should include the contribution of other <i>CO</i> <sup>-</sup> resonant states. The importance of the last contribution has been also estimated by using a scaling law to extend the <i>v</i> = 0 cross section over all the vibrational ladder of CO. In particular, this mechanism becomes competitive with the other reactive channels for very short inter-pulse delay times, i.e., the <i>t</i> <sub><i>id</i></sub> = 1 μ<i>s</i>, being less important for longer inter-pulse delay times, i.e., the <i>t</i> <sub><i>id</i></sub> = 25 μ<i>s</i>.},

The case of a hypersonic flow past a sphere is considered as a test model for systems in strong chemical and thermal nonequilibrium conditions, mimicking the extreme environment experienced by objects entering a planetary atmosphere. The problem has been studied using the state-to-state approach, calculating directly the distribution of vibrational levels of O2 and N2, together with the flow field, including also viscous effects. Nonequilibrium distributions are observed and the results have been compared with macroscopic experimental data, showing that the state-to-state model is able to provide better capabilities for predicting experimental results than the traditional multitemperature approach. The use of graphics processing units allowed us to obtain these results in a two-dimensional configuration, opening additional perspectives in the investigation of reacting flows.},

@article{pub.1127069298,
 abstract = {An advanced model for the calculation of electron energy distribution functions (eedfs), vibrational distributions, and electronic excited state densities of reacting CO2 in microwave (MW) discharges has been developed for clarifying: (1) the role of electronic states of the relevant neutral species in affecting the eedf and (2) the contribution to the CO2 dissociation of the electron impact and heavy particle dissociation mechanisms. To model the discharge, the power density typical of MW discharges is used as a parameter. Different case studies including optically thick and thin plasmas and the dependence of the CO2 dissociation rates on the gas temperature are investigated. The results show that at a low gas temperature, i.e., 300 K, the heavy-particle dissociation mechanism, also called the pure vibrational mechanism, prevails on the electron impact dissociation one, while at a high gas temperature, i.e., 2000 K, the two mechanisms become competitive and the global behavior strongly depends on the choice of electron impact dissociation cross sections. Large differences appear in the eedf, especially in the post-discharge regime, when considering thick and thin plasmas. In the thick case, a well-structured eedf appears as a result of superelastic collisions mainly involving the electronic states of the relevant neutral species. In the thin plasma, many peaks disappear because the concentration of the excited states strongly decreases. Finally, our model gives the results of conversion and energy efficiency as well as vibrational distributions in satisfactory agreement with the corresponding results calculated by the Antwerp group.},

 abstract = {Numerous applications have required the study of CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ plasmas since the 1960s, from CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ lasers to spacecraft heat shields. However, in recent years, intense research activities on the subject have restarted because of environmental problems associated with CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ emissions. The present review provides a synthesis of the current state of knowledge on the physical chemistry of cold CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ plasmas. In particular, the different modeling approaches implemented to address specific aspects of CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ plasmas are presented. Throughout the paper, the importance of conducting joint experimental, theoretical and modeling studies to elucidate the complex couplings at play in CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ plasmas is emphasized. Therefore, the experimental data that are likely to bring relevant constraints to the different modeling approaches are first reviewed. Second, the calculation of some key elementary processes obtained with semi-empirical, classical and quantum methods is presented. In order to describe the electron kinetics, the latest coherent sets of cross section satisfying the constraints of “electron swarm” analyses are introduced, and the need for self-consistent calculations for determining accurate electron energy distribution function (EEDF) is evidenced. The main findings of the latest zero-dimensional (0D) global models about the complex chemistry of CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ and its dissociation products in different plasma discharges are then given, and full state-to-state (STS) models of only the vibrational-dissociation kinetics developed for studies of spacecraft shields are described. Finally, two important points for all applications using CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ containing plasma are discussed: the role of surfaces in contact with the plasma, and the need for 2D/3D models to capture the main features of complex reactor geometries including effects induced by fluid dynamics on the plasma properties. In addition to bringing together the latest advances in the description of CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ non-equilibrium plasmas, the results presented here also highlight the fundamental data that are still missing and the possible routes that still need to be investigated.Graphic abstract},

 abstract = {A plasma discharge in a Helium gas reactor at different pressures and at low currents (0.25–0.45 A) has been investigated by Computational Fluid Dynamic modeling coupled with the Maxwell’s equations. The results show different discharge dynamics across the pressure range (0.1–8 MPa), with an arc discharge obtained at high pressure and a low current arc discharge observed at atmospheric pressure. A large density gradient at higher pressure causes a strong natural convection effect in the reactor. This density gradient affects drastically the discharge shape and the velocity field at high pressures while at atmospheric pressure, a lower density gradient was observed resulting in a low velocity magnitude. It has been observed that the velocity magnitude is not affected by the electric current. The discharge electric potential has been calculated by considering the electrical characterization of the electrodes and numerical results have been compared with experimental results. The comparison shows a good agreement between the measured and calculated discharge electric potential at lower pressures. These devices can be used as plasma sources for wastewater treatment.},

The aim of the study is on one hand to investigate the unsteady behavior of such an interaction and on the other to evaluate thermo-chemical non-equilibrium effects. Two different thermo-physical models have been considered, the classical multi-temperature, or mode approximation, and the state-to-state vibrational kinetics. It is shown that for the geometric configuration under investigation, the occurrence of unsteady periodic behavior depends on the flow conditions and is inhibited in the high enthalpy case. Furthermore, non-equilibrium effects become relevant in the case of high enthalpy flows and discrepancies between the results obtained with the two models are observed.},

To account for pressure dependence, novel thermodynamic and transport properties have been calculated in a wide pressure and temperature range. The model has been further improved by considering the effect of plasma–electrode interactions and the formation of the plasma sheath. High-performance computing (HPC) was used to solve the CFD simulation, focusing on reference cases at 8 MPa and 0.35 A.

 abstract = {We report results obtained by our 0D, time-dependent self-consistent model for the description of the CO2 plasma kinetics in glow discharge conditions, comparing our results with the simulation and experimental results reported by Grofulovic et al (2018 Plasma Sources Sci. Technol. 27 115009; 2019 PhD Thesis) and Klarenaar et al (2017 Plasma Sources Sci. Technol. 26 115008). Our model is based on the simultaneous solution of the kinetic equations describing the vibrational, the electronic excited states and the plasma chemistry and of the electron Boltzmann equation for the calculation of the electron energy distribution function (eedf). The results for the vibrational level densities of CO2 show a satisfactory agreement with the Grofulovic’s model results, despite the differences in the vibrational energy level scheme and in the kinetic processes included with the correspondent rate coefficients, with a good match also with the corresponding experimental results. Moreover, conditions characterized by higher power density (5–50 W cm−3) have been investigated to understand the behavior of the CO2 plasma discharge when a higher vibrational excitation is present. Large deviations of the vibrational distributions of CO2 and CO from equilibrium ones are predicted both in discharge and post discharge conditions. In particular, the CO2 vibrational distribution presents a behavior similar to a Treanor distribution for v < 15 while a deactivation of the plateau in the vibrational distribution function after v > 15 appears as a consequence of the dissociation induced by vibrational excitation mechanism, i.e. pure vibrational mechanism, becoming important at higher power densities. Finally, the results dependence on the selection of the CO2 electron molecule dissociation cross section, i.e. Phelps (1973 J. Appl. Phys. 44 4464 or Cosby (1993 Report No. AD-A266 464 WL-TR-93-2004 (Dayton, OH: Wright-Patterson Airforce Base)), has been investigated, showing that its more opportune choice is still a problem to be discussed for the description of conditions in which the electron impact dissociation dominates the kinetics, while once vibrational excitation is activated, CO2 dissociation is essentially driven by vibrational-induced dissociation, depending to a minor extent from that choice.},

 abstract = {The activation of vibrational-induced dissociation of CO2 in cold non-equilibrium plasma discharges is investigated by means of a 0D self-consistent kinetic model, which, with a state-to-state approach, is able to calculate the CO2 vibrational distribution function (vdf) of the asymmetric mode levels, the electron energy distribution function and the corresponding vibrational-induced and electron impact CO2 dissociation rates. The conditions for the onset of such activation are linked to the achievement of a sufficiently high CO2 vibrational excitation characterized by the presence of a non-equilibrium plateau in the CO2 vdf, resulting from the combined effect of electron–vibrational and vibrational–vibrational collisions, which, by overpopulating the higher vibrational levels, enhances dissociation. Such non-equilibrium conditions are maximized at lower gas temperature, lower pressure and higher power density values. In particular, for the power density, an activation threshold value can be obtained from simulations and its dependence on the gas temperature and pressure can be investigated. The dependence of the maximum vibrational temperature reached at the end of the discharge as a function of the gas temperature and pressure is also analyzed. A satisfactory agreement from our simulation results with the Kotov’s criterion for vibrational activation has been found.},

 abstract = {This study concerns the importance of the precursor (or pre-reactive) state of elementary physicochemical processes whose basic features, as structure, stability, and trapping effect of reagents, are controlled by the balance of intermolecular forces that arise at long range and operate at intermediate and short separation distances. The detailed formulation of such forces, determining formation probability and dynamical evolution of the precursor state, is of relevance in molecular science and difficult to be treated by quantum chemistry. Such a problem has been tackled by us exploiting the phenomenological approach, which employs semi-empirical and empirical formulas to represent strength, range and angular dependence of the leading interaction components involved. In addition to the study of transport phenomena, part of the attention is addressed to chemi-ionization (or Penning ionization) reactions for which neutral reagents lead to atomic and/or molecular ions plus electrons as products. Chemi-ionizations are bimolecular processes occurring in several environments of interest, where a reagent is a species, formed in excited-metastable electronic states by collisions with energetic electrons or cosmic rays. For such reactions all crucial electronic rearrangements, affecting stability and evolution of the weakly bound precursor state, here coincident with the reaction transition state, are characterized with a high detail. The results of the present study are of interest for many other processes, whose precursor states and their relevant features are difficult to characterize, often masked by several other effects.Graphical abstract},

 abstract = {This study focuses on the role of CO2 and CO electronically excited states in the kinetics of CO2 cold non-equilibrium plasma discharges by means of a state-to-state OD kinetic model based on the simultaneous and self-consistent solution of the electron Boltzmann equation and the master equations describing the vibrationally and electronically excited state kinetics and the plasma composition. A new CO2 dissociation model based on the use of the Biagi electron impact excitation cross sections, considered as fully dissociative, of several CO2 electronic excited states, in the energy range from 6.5 to 25 eV, is tested and compared with the results obtained by using the Phelps database in typical glow and microwave discharge conditions. Moreover, a refinement of the kinetics of the COa3Π$$\mathrm{CO}\left({\mathrm{a}}^{3}\Pi \right)$$ excited state is proposed by including new production and loss terms and the effect of the change of its time evolution density on the eedf, the electron temperature, the CO2 and CO vibrational distribution functions, electron impact and vibrational induced dissociation rates is investigated. Finally, the contribution of the COa3Π$$\mathrm{CO}\left({\mathrm{a}}^{3}\Pi \right)$$ state to CO2 dissociation is examined in terms of production and recombination (or back-reaction) processes both in microwave and glow discharge conditions.},

 abstract = {In the era of space exploration, one of the fundamental goals is the investigation of the atmospheric re-entry of a space vehicle, which undergoes tremendous heat load due to the shock waves forming in front of its thermal shield. In the view of heat mitigation, ablative materials are employed for the design of the Thermal Protection System (TPS) of most of the modern vehicles. Such materials essentially modify the nature of the gas in the boundary layer due to the interaction of the solid and gas phases. Thanks to the material consumption, heat load is mitigated at the expense of ablated species which significantly contaminate the boundary layer gas mixture. In this context, this work aims at characterizing the aerothermodynamics environment around a bluff body in the presence of ablation and thermochemical non-equilibrium. Specifically, a five species neutral air mixture (N 2 , O 2 , NO, N, O) is combined with a six ablated species mixture (CO, CN, CO 2 , C, C 2 , C 3 ). Two test cases are considered. Firstly, a subsonic pure nitrogen flow past an ablative sample is simulated, which is used as verification study by direct comparison with numerical results. For this reason, a classic multitemperature (mT) approach is employed to handle non-equilibrium. The second test case is a well-known hypersonic air flow past a spherical body used as a benchmark to assess the influence of ablation. In this case, two different kinetics models are used, namely the classical multitemperature and the more sophisticated State-to-State (StS) approach.},

 abstract = {The paper collects and discusses the results obtained in the theoretical investigation of cold plasmas by using a state-to-state self-consistent kinetic approach, coupling chemistry and free electron kinetics. Examples are selected, not only to review the most recent advancements made in updating and extending the chemical model, but also to highlight the role played in all these systems by excited states, either vibrational or electronic, in affecting the plasma evolution in the discharge and in the post-discharge phases in different discharge configurations. The response of the kinetic simulation to the accuracy of the dynamical data describing the collisional processes, to the theoretical scheme adopted for the vibrational levels of molecules, and to the inclusion of the relevant dissociation channels, is discussed also in the light of the comparison with experiments for model validation.},
