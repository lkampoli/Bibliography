@article{pub.1007938719,
 abstract = {We propose a new implicit computational fluid dynamics method for steady-state compressible reacting flows. The concept is to decouple the total mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations from the species mass and internal energy equations and to solve the two equation sets sequentially. With certain approximations to the implicit system, it is possible to dramatically reduce the cost of the solution with little to no penalty on the convergence properties. Importantly, the cost of the decoupled implicit problem scales linearly with the number of species, as opposed to the quadratic scaling for the conventional fully coupled method. Furthermore, the new approach reduces the memory requirements by a significant factor. The decoupled implicit method shows promise for the application to aerothermodynamics problems and reacting flows.},

 abstract = {The chapter focuses on two aspects of the solver, as well as the parallel performance of the hybrid implicit method. A new parallel implicit solver for the solution of the compressible Navier–Stokes equations with finite rate chemistry on unstructured finite volume meshes is presented in the chapter. The solver employs the data-parallel line relaxation (DPLR) method for implicit time integration along the lines of cells that are normal to the wall. A point-implicit method is used in the regions where surface-normal lines are not constructed. The new method combines the robustness and efficiency of the implicit DPLR method with the flexibility of using unstructured discretizations. The solver employs a low-dissipation pure-upwind numerical scheme based on the Steger-Warming split flux method, as well as a MUSCL-type scheme designed for unstructured discretizations. The DPLR method is superior to other parallel methods, such as matrix-based point-implicit methods designed for chemically reacting hypersonic flow simulations.},

@article{pub.1058094465,
 abstract = {Accurate modeling of high-temperature hypersonic flows in the atmosphere requires consideration of collision-induced dissociation of molecular species and energy transfer between the translational and internal modes of the gas molecules. Here, we describe a study of the N2 + N2⟶N2 + 2N and N2 + N2⟶4N nitrogen dissociation reactions using the quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) method. The simulations used a new potential energy surface for the N4 system; the surface is an improved version of one that was presented previously. In the QCT calculations, initial conditions were determined based on a two-temperature model that approximately separates the translational-rotational temperature from the vibrational temperature of the N2 diatoms. Five values from 8000 K to 30,000 K were considered for each of the two temperatures. Over 2.4 × 10(9) trajectories were calculated. We present results for ensemble-averaged dissociation rate constants as functions of the translational-rotational temperature T and the vibrational temperature T(v). The rate constant depends more strongly on T when T(v) is low, and it depends more strongly on T(v) when T is low. Quasibound reactant states contribute significantly to the rate constants, as do exchange processes at higher temperatures. We discuss two sets of runs in detail: an equilibrium test set in which T = T(v) and a nonequilibrium test set in which T(v) < T. In the equilibrium test set, high-v and moderately-low-j molecules contribute most significantly to the overall dissociation rate, and this state specificity becomes stronger as the temperature decreases. Dissociating trajectories tend to result in a major loss of vibrational energy and a minor loss of rotational energy. In the nonequilibrium test set, as T(v) decreases while T is fixed, higher-j molecules contribute more significantly to the dissociation rate, dissociating trajectories tend to result in a greater rotational energy loss, and the dissociation probability's dependence on v weakens. In this way, as T(v) decreases, rotational energy appears to compensate for the decline in average vibrational energy in promoting dissociation. In both the equilibrium and nonequilibrium test sets, in every case, the average total internal energy loss in the dissociating trajectories is between 10.2 and 11.0 eV, slightly larger than the equilibrium potential energy change of N2 dissociation.},

 abstract = {The direct molecular simulation (DMS) approach is used to predict the internal energy relaxation and dissociation dynamics of high-temperature nitrogen. An ab initio potential energy surface (PES) is used to calculate the dynamics of two interacting nitrogen molecules by providing forces between the four atoms. In the near-equilibrium limit, it is shown that DMS reproduces the results obtained from well-established quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) analysis, verifying the validity of the approach. DMS is used to predict the vibrational relaxation time constant for N2–N2 collisions and its temperature dependence, which are in close agreement with existing experiments and theory. Using both QCT and DMS with the same PES, we find that dissociation significantly depletes the upper vibrational energy levels. As a result, across a wide temperature range, the dissociation rate is found to be approximately 4–5 times lower compared to the rates computed using QCT with Boltzmann energy distributions. DMS calculations predict a quasi-steady-state distribution of rotational and vibrational energies in which the rate of depletion of high-energy states due to dissociation is balanced by their rate of repopulation due to collisional processes. The DMS approach simulates the evolution of internal energy distributions and their coupling to dissociation without the need to precompute rates or cross sections for all possible energy transitions. These benchmark results could be used to develop new computational fluid dynamics models for high-enthalpy flow applications.},

 abstract = {During the past three years, we have worked to develop and analyze a high-enthalpy flow dataset for CFD code validation. In collaboration with CUBRC Inc. personnel, we designed the experimental conditions for the double-cone geometry used in previous low-enthalpy nitrogen tests. We then used our standard CFD codes and thermo-chemical models to analyze these flows. In general, the comparisons with nitrogen flows are good, even at high enthalpy (10MJ/kg). But the comparisons between predictions and experiments for air above 5MJ/kg is poor. We find that as the enthalpy increases, the agreement gets worse. In particular, the CFD predicts that the separation zone decreases in size much more rapidly than given in the experiments.},

 abstract = { Numerical methods are developed to simulate high temperature gas flow and coupled surface reactions, relevant to porous thermal protection systems used by hypersonic vehicles. Due to the non-continuum nature of these flows, the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is used, and the computational complexity of the simulations presents a number of unique challenges. Strategies for parallel partitioning, interprocessor communication, complex microstructure geometry representation, cutcell procedures, and parallel file input/output are presented and tested. Algorithms and data structures are developed for a microstructure generation tool called FiberGen that enables realistic microstructures to be constructed based on targeted fiber radius, orientation, and overall porosity, with user defined variations about these values. The data structures and algorithms associated with FiberGen are robust and efficient enough to enable DSMC simulations where the microstructure geometry changes to directly simulate ablation problems. Subsonic boundary conditions are described and validated, and a number of example solutions are presented. The example problems demonstrate the difference between surface ablation and in-depth volume ablation regimes for porous TPS materials.},

 abstract = {Micro scale simulations are performed of flow through porous (pyrolyzing) thermal protection system (TPS) materials using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. DSMC results for permeability are validated with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations and theory, for simple porous geometries under continuum flow conditions. An artificial fiber-microstructure generation code FiberGen is used to create triangulated surface geometry representative of FiberForm® (FiberForm) material. DSMC results for permeability of FiberForm are validated for a range of pressures (transitional flow conditions) and agree with experimental measurements. Numerical uncertainty is determined to be within 2% if sufficiently large portions of the microstructure are included in the computation. However, small variations in fiber size and angle bias can combine to give + 30 % uncertainty when comparing with experimental permeability data. X-ray microtomography scans of FiberForm are used to create microstructure geometry for incorporation within DSMC simulations of coupled oxygen diffusion and gas-surface chemistry in the presence of a blowing pyrolysis gas. In-depth penetration of atomic oxygen is limited to 0.2 – 0.4 mm for the range of Knudsen number and pyrolysis gas conditions studied.},

 abstract = {A computational approach is developed to simulate high-enthalpy shock propagation under strong nonequilibrium conditions, such as reentry experiments at NASA’s Electric Arc Shock Tube (EAST) facility. Two-dimensional axisymmetric simulations of EAST flow are performed for Earth reentry at 10 km/s. An 11-species weakly ionized air model is used to capture the real-gas behavior with reaction rates from the literature. Species mass-diffusion fluxes are calculated assuming a self-consistent effective binary diffusion in conjunction with Gupta–Yos collision integral data. The unsteady, linearized system of conservation laws is solved in a moving frame of reference with active shock tracking to reduce the computational cost by three orders of magnitude relative to that of fixed-frame calculations on a uniform grid. This approach enables time-accurate yet computationally feasible predictions of gas behavior at the test section. Computational fluid dynamics predictions can be compared with the experimental data to gain an improved understanding of the flow physics. Additionally, useful quantities such as boundary-layer thickness and growth rate, and radial variation of gas properties can be computed, which are difficult to measure in experiments.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes a probabilistic framework for assessing the consistency of an experimental dataset, i.e., whether the stated experimental conditions are consistent with the measurements provided. In case the dataset is inconsistent, our framework allows one to hypothesize and test sources of inconsistencies. This is crucial in model validation efforts. The framework relies on Bayesian inference to estimate experimental settings deemed uncertain, from measurements deemed accurate. The quality of the inferred variables is gauged by its ability to reproduce held-out experimental measurements. The correctness of the framework is tested on three double-cone experiments conducted in the Calspan-University at Buffalo Research Center’s Large Energy National Shock Tunnel-I (LENS-I), which have also been numerically simulated successfully. Thereafter, the framework is used to investigate two double-cone experiments (executed in the LENS-XX), which have encountered difficulties when used in model validation exercises. An inconsistency is detected with one of the LENS-XX experiments. In addition, two causes are hypothesized for our inability to simulate LEXS-XX experiments accurately and are tested using our framework. It is found that there is no single cause that explains all the discrepancies between model predictions and experimental data, but different causes explain different discrepancies, to larger or smaller extent. This paper proposes that uncertainty quantification methods be used more widely to understand experiments and characterize facilities, and three different methods are cited to do so, the third of which is presented in this paper.},

Only the leading-edge portions of these flow configurations are studied. The simulations are verified to be converged in terms of grid and particle resolution. Overall, excellent agreement is found between DSMC and CFD predictions of the leading-edge boundary layer, the magnitude of velocity-slip and temperature-jump, and surface heat flux for all cases considered, with the exception of the double-cone case due to the relatively high Knudsen number of the flow. The largest discrepancies were found for the double-cone (transitional flow conditions), and near-exact agreement was found for the double-wedge (continuum flow conditions). It was determined that slip effects cannot account for the discrepancy between CFD predictions and experimentally measured heat flux for the hollow-cylinder flare. Furthermore, it was determined that the previously recommended threshold for the continuum breakdown parameter might be overly conservative in the near-wall region if appropriate slip models are used in CFD.},

 abstract = {Stardust reentry flows have been simulated at 80 km altitude, 12.8 km/s, using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Neutral and ionization processes among neutral air species, as well as five ionic species and electrons were considered in the DSMC flowfield modeling using the ion‐averaged velocity model to maintain charge‐neutrality. In CFD, two electron temperature models were compared, and it was found that the degree of ionization (DOI) is sensitive to the electron temperature model. At 80 km, the DOI predicted by DSMC was found to be approximately 3%, but in CFD, the DOI is greater than 20% for the case of Te = Ttr and 9% for the case of Te = Tvib. Therefore, compared to the DSMC solution, the assumption of Te = Tvib is preferable in CFD. Using the Mott‐Smith (M‐S) model, good agreement was obtained between the analytical bimodal distribution functions and DSMC velocity distributions. An effective temperature correction in the relaxation and chemical reaction models using the M‐S model was developed in CFD, and the model reduced the continuum breakdown discrepancy between DSMC and CFD inside the shock in terms of DOI and temperatures. With the M‐S model, the DOI for the case of Te = Tvib in CFD is decreased by approximately 3%.},

 abstract = {View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2021-2798.vid This paper outlines the main design considerations of a CubeSat-like, miniature re-entry vehicle, HyCUBE. that will serve as a versatile hypersonic flight test platform. HyCUBE's proposed first mission aims to collect experimental measurements of the aerothermodynamic environment that vehicles moving at hypersonic speeds encounter during re-entry from low Earth orbit. The data to be collected will contribute to the improvement and validation of computational models. Numerical simulations were used to establish the aerodynamic characteristics of the proposed vehicle, to evaluate the heat-load such that the thermal protection system can be sized, and to guide sensor placement and selection. The direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were used where applicable, as well as analytical tools for the vehicle's computed trajectory. Preliminary designs for the form factor and sensor suite are proposed and discussed.},

 abstract = {View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-0675.vid High speed flight induces extreme aerothermal loads on a vehicle. As a result, material selection and understanding material response to aerothermal loading is important. The presence of particles in the atmosphere and the potential for a vehicle to fly through precipitation at low altitudes may cause substantial damage to leading edges and control surfaces of high-speed flight vehciles. Computational techniques for modeling the physics of particles and droplets, and their interactions with solids in various flow regimes, are investigated, particularly those that might impact thermal protection systems for aircraft at high velocities. A multi-material fluid based approach for modeling problems in this regime is examined. This method combines Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) hydrodynamics with Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) and includes an anisotropic stress tensor and multi-zone physics. The method is tested for small particles (4 $\mu m$ diameter) impacting a material surface at high speeds (500 - 700 m/s).},
