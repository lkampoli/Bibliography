                    The Burnett equations constitute a set of higher-order continuum equations. These equations are obtained from the Chapman–Enskog series solution of the Boltzmann equation while retaining second-order-accurate terms in the Knudsen number

However, obtaining analytical or numerical solutions of these equations has been noted to be particularly difficult. In the first part of this work, we present the full set of Burnett equations in cylindrical coordinates in three-dimensional form. The equations are reported in a generalized way for gas molecules that are assumed to be Maxwellian molecules or hard spheres. In the second part, a closed-form solution of these equations for isothermal Poiseuille flow in a microtube is derived. The solution of the equations is shown to satisfy the full Burnett equations up to

Comparison of the stress terms in the Burnett and Navier–Stokes equations is presented. The significance of the Burnett normal stress and its role in diffusion of momentum is brought out by the analysis. An order-of-magnitude analysis of various terms in the equations is presented, based on which a reduced model of the Burnett equations is provided for flow in a microtube. The Burnett equations in full three-dimensional form in cylindrical coordinates and their solution are not previously available.

 abstract = { An analytical correlation is developed for stagnation-point heat flux on spherical objects travelling at high velocity which is accurate for conditions ranging from the continuum to the free-molecular flow regime. Theoretical analysis of the Burnett and super-Burnett equations is performed using simplifications from shock-wave and boundary-layer theory to determine the relative contribution of higher-order heat flux terms compared with the Fourier heat flux (assumed in the Navier–Stokes equations). A rarefaction parameter (    $W_{r}\equiv M_{\infty }^{2{\it\omega}}/Re_{\infty }$   ), based on the free-stream Mach number (    $M_{\infty }$   ), the Reynolds number (    $Re_{\infty }$   ) and the viscosity–temperature index (    ${\it\omega}$   ), is identified as a better correlating parameter than the Knudsen number in the transition regime. By studying both the Burnett and super-Burnett equations, a general form for the entire series of higher-order heat flux contributions is obtained. The resulting heat flux expression includes terms with dependence on gas properties, stagnation to wall-temperature ratio and a main dependence on powers of the rarefaction parameter    $W_{r}$   . The expression is applied as a correction to the Fourier heat flux and therefore can be combined with any continuum-based correlation of choice. In the free-molecular limit, a bridging function is used to ensure consistency with well-established free-molecular flow theory. The correlation is then fitted to direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) solutions for stagnation-point heat flux in high-speed nitrogen flows. The correlation is shown to accurately capture the variation in heat flux predicted by the DSMC method in the transition flow regime, while limiting to both continuum and free-molecular values. },

 abstract = {A new set of generalized transport equations is derived for higher-order moments which are generated in evolution equation for stress tensor and heat flux vector in 13-moment equations. The closure we employ satisfies Onsager's symmetry principle. In the derivation, we do not employ a phase density function based on Hermite polynomial series in terms of higher-order moments, unlike Grad's approach. The distribution function is rather chosen to satisfy collision invariance, and H-theorem and capture relatively strong deviations from equilibrium. The phase density function satisfies the linearized Boltzmann equation and provides the correct value of the Prandtl number for monatomic gas. The derived equations are compared with Grad's 13-moments equations for gas modeled as Maxwellian molecule. The merits of the proposed equations against Grad's and R13 equations are discussed. In particular, it is noted that the proposed equations contain higher-order terms compared to these equations but require a fewer number of boundary conditions as compared to the R13 equations. The Knudsen number envelope which can be covered to describe flows with these equations is therefore expected to be larger as compared to the earlier equations. },

 abstract = { The amount sublimated of large organic molecules varies with the square of the diameter of the tube in which sublimation occurs. This implies that the velocity profile in the tube is nearly flat, consistent with volume diffusion, but not with laminar flow, Knudsen diffusion, or slip flow. However, molecular simulation calculations show that under the conditions used, the velocity profile is near parabolic when there is no deposition on the tube wall, inconsistent with volume diffusion, but in agreement with laminar flow. These calculations also show that deposition on the wall does result in velocity which is almost constant with radial position. The result is a laminar flow profile which is nearly flat, and hence a total flux proportional to the square of the tube diameter, which is observed both in these simulations and in physical experiments. © 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J , 63: 1757–1764, 2017 },

 abstract = { Heat flux and drag correlations are developed for high-speed flow over spherical geometries that are accurate for any Knudsen number ranging from continuum to free-molecular conditions. A stagnation point heat flux correlation is derived as a correction to the continuum (Fourier model) heat flux and also reproduces the correct heat flux in the free-molecular limit by use of a bridging function. In this manner, the correlation can be combined with existing continuum correlations based on computational fluid dynamics simulations, yet it can now be used accurately in the transitional and free-molecular regimes. The functional form of the stagnation point heat flux correlation is physics based, and was derived via the Burnett and super-Burnett equations in a recent article, Singh & Schwartzentruber ( J. Fluid Mech. , vol. 792, 2016, pp. 981–996). In addition, correlation parameters from the literature are used to construct simple expressions for the local heat flux around the sphere as well as the integrated drag coefficient. A large number of direct simulation Monte Carlo calculations are performed over a wide range of conditions. The computed heat flux and drag data are used to validate the correlations and also to fit the correlation parameters. Compared to existing continuum-based correlations, the new correlations will enable engineering analysis of flight conditions at higher altitudes and/or smaller geometry radii, useful for a variety of applications including blunt body planetary entry, sharp leading edges, low orbiting satellites, meteorites and space debris. },

 abstract = {A set of constitutive relations for the stress tensor and heat flux vector for the hydrodynamic description of rarefied gas flows is derived in this work. A phase density function consistent with Onsager's reciprocity principle and H theorem is utilized to capture nonequilibrium thermodynamics effects. The phase density function satisfies the linearized Boltzmann equation and the collision invariance property. Our formulation provides the correct value of the Prandtl number as it involves two different relaxation times for momentum and energy transport by diffusion. Generalized three-dimensional constitutive equations for different kinds of molecules are derived using the phase density function. The derived constitutive equations involve cross single derivatives of field variables such as temperature and velocity, with no higher-order derivative in higher-order terms. This is remarkable feature of the equations as the number of boundary conditions required is the same as needed for conventional Navier-Stokes equations. Linear stability analysis of the equations is performed, which shows that the derived equations are unconditionally stable. A comparison of the derived equations with existing Burnett-type equations is presented and salient features of our equations are outlined. The classic internal flow problem, force-driven compressible plane Poiseuille flow, is chosen to verify the stable Burnett equations and the results for equilibrium variables are presented.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this work is to evaluate the recently derived Onsager-Burnett (OBurnett) equations [N. Singh, R. S. Jadhav, and A. Agrawal, “Derivation of stable Burnett equations for rarefied gas flows,” Phys. Rev. E 96, 013106 (2017)] for force-driven compressible plane Poiseuille flow. This classical internal flow problem depicts several non-equilibrium phenomena, for instance, non-constant pressure profile in the transverse direction and tangential heat flux, which are not captured by the classical Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations. The results of OBurnett equations for conserved and non-conserved variables are validated against the existing direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results. These results suggest that the OBurnett equations are able to predict most of the variables well with respect to DSMC and MD simulation results. We find that the OBurnett equations predict a strictly monotonic pressure profile, in contrast to the bimodal profile predicted by the DSMC results and the conventional Burnett equations, but in agreement with the molecular dynamics simulation results. The equations also recover the non-zero tangential heat flux but fail to capture the peculiar temperature dip at the center, owing to its second order accuracy. These results suggest that the evaluated equations are accurate in predicting the non-equilibrium phenomena observed in the rarefied gas flows for the case considered.},

Due to strong coupling between internal energy and dissociation chemistry, such non-Boltzmann effects can influence the overall dissociation rate in the gas.

The perturbation expansion is employed with the smallness parameter    $\unicode[STIX]{x1D716}$   , taken as the ratio of height to length of the microchannel. The solution for pressure is obtained by solving the cross-stream momentum equation while the velocity distribution is obtained from the streamwise momentum equation. The resulting ordinary differential equations in pressure and velocity are third-order and second-order, respectively. The required boundary conditions for pressure are obtained from direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) data. The obtained analytical solution matches the available DSMC solution well.

 abstract = { Aerosol deposition (AD) can lead to the formation of dense coatings via deposition of particles from a gas flow; in AD the aerosol is passed through a converging-diverging nozzle, facilitating inertial particle impaction on a desired substrate at supersonic particle velocities. Unique from thermal spray methods, AD can be applied near room temperature and unique from cold spray, in AD the aerosol is typically at atmospheric pressure upstream of the nozzle. Though AD has been successfully demonstrated previously, a number of aspects related to particle motion in AD systems remain poorly understood. In this work, we simulated compressible flow field profiles and particle trajectories for typical AD working conditions for a slit type converging-diverging nozzle with a planar substrate. In examining the fluid flow profile, we show that the velocity and pressure profiles, as well as the shock structure are sensitive to the upstream and downstream operating pressures of the nozzle. These ultimately affect particle impaction speed. Importantly, in AD, the particle drag regime is dynamic; both particle Knudsen numbers and Mach numbers can vary by orders of magnitude. To aid particle trajectory simulations, we trained a neural network to predict the drag force on the particles based on existing experimental data, theoretical limits, and new direct simulation Monte Carlo (DMSC) results. The neural network based drag law, which depends upon both Mach and Knudsen numbers, shows better agreement with the DSMC simulation data than pre-existing correlations. With it, particle trajectory simulation results reveal that for a given particle density, there exists an optimal particle diameter to maximize particle impaction speed. We also find that in AD particles undergo size dependent inertial focusing, i.e. there is a particular particle diameter where the particle deposition linewidth is minimized. Particles smaller than this diameter are underfocused, and particles larger than this are overfocused, and hence have larger deposition linewidths in both cases. Using trajectory simulations, we additionally developed a framework that can be used to evaluate the position-dependent mass, momentum and kinetic energy fluxes to the deposition substrate for any aerosol size distribution function upstream of the nozzle. It is shown for typical aerosol concentrations achievable in the laboratory, the kinetic energy flux can approach a magnitude normally observed in convective heat transfer with phase change, hence translational kinetic energy to thermal energy transfer in AD is likely a key contributor to the formation of dense coatings.},

 abstract = {Dissociation is strongly coupled to the vibrational energy population of the dissociating gas. High-temperature excitation results in the overpopulation of high-energy states which enhances the dissociation rate as high-vibrational energy states are strongly favored to dissociation. Dissociation then results in the depletion of the high-energy population and consequently, a balance between excitation and dissociation is reached resulting in quasi-steady state (QSS). QSS is characterized by time-invariant non-Boltzmann depleted distributions and therefore reduced dissociation rates relative to the equilibrium estimates. In the kinetics models developed thus far, either the non-Boltzmann effects are ignored or added as pre-factors in an ad-hoc manner to an equilibrium rate constant. Recently, using ab initio potential energy surfaces, direct molecular simulation (DMS) approach has simulated the evolution of air species at the conditions representative of post-shock conditions. Based on the DMS data, a simple physics based model to characterize the non-Boltzmann distributions is developed. The model is compared with zero-dimensional DMS simulations for nitrogen and oxygen at constant temperature (isothermal) and constant energy (adiabatic) conditions. The non-Boltzmann distributions are then used in conjunction with state-specific dissociation rate constants to derive a non-equilibrium continuum dissociation model.},

The model can be used, in place of equilibrium (Boltzmann) distribution functions, when deriving reaction rate constants for high-temperature nonequilibrium flows. The distribution model is derived based on the recent ab initio calculations, carried out using potential energy surfaces developed using accurate computational quantum chemistry techniques for the purpose of studying air chemistry at high temperatures. Immediately behind a strong shock wave, the vibrational energy distribution is non-Boltzmann. Specifically, as the gas internal energy rapidly excites to a high temperature, overpopulation of the high-energy tail (relative to a corresponding Boltzmann distribution) is observed in ab initio simulations. As the gas excites further and begins to dissociate, a depletion of the high-energy tail is observed, during a time-invariant quasi-steady state. Since the probability of dissociation is exponentially related to the vibrational energy of the dissociating molecule, the overall dissociation rate is sensitive to the populations of these high vibrational energy states. The non-Boltzmann effects captured by the new model either enhance or reduce the dissociation rate relative to that obtained assuming a Boltzmann distribution. This article proposes a simple model that is demonstrated to reproduce these non-Boltzmann effects quantitatively when compared to ab initio simulations.},

 abstract = {In this article, we propose a generalized non-equilibrium chemical kinetics model from ab initio simulation data obtained using accurate potential energy surfaces developed recently for the purpose of studying high-temperature air chemistry. First, we present a simple cross section model for dissociation that captures recent ab initio data accurately. The cross section model is analytically integrated over Boltzmann distributions and general non-Boltzmann distributions to derive a general non-equilibrium dissociation model. The general non-Boltzmann model systematically incorporates key physics such as dependence on translational energy, rotational energy, vibrational energy, internal energy, centrifugal barrier, and non-Boltzmann effects such as overpopulation and depletion of high energy states. The model is shown to reproduce the rates from quasi-classical trajectory calculations for Boltzmann distributions of internal energy states. The reduced rates in a non-equilibrium steady state due to depletion of high internal energy states are also predicted well by the model. Furthermore, the model predicts the enhanced rates as observed due to significant overpopulation of high vibrational states relative to Boltzmann distributions while the gas is in non-equilibrium in the transient phase. The model provides a computationally inexpensive way of incorporating non-equilibrium chemistry without incurring additional cost in the existing computational tools. Further comparisons of the model are carried out in Paper II, where simplifications to the model are proposed based on the results.},

All three methods predict final state distributions from explicit quasi-classical trajectory simulations with <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.998. Although a function-based approach is found to be more than two times better in computational performance, the grid-based approach is preferred in terms of prediction accuracy, practicability, and generality. For the function-based approach, the choice of parametrized functions is crucial and this aspect is explicitly probed for final vibrational state distributions. Applications of the grid-based approach to nonequilibrium, multitemperature initial state distributions are presented, a situation common to energy and state distributions in hypersonic flows. The role of such models in direct simulation Monte Carlo and computational fluid dynamics simulations is also discussed.},

 abstract = {We derive a metric to assess the reliability of linear constitutive relations that describe nonequilibrium hydrodynamic transport. The derivation of the metric utilizes the first-order perturbation to equilibrium Maxwellian velocity density function in the Chapman-Enskog expansion. The metric is defined as the contribution to macroscopic quantities from those regions of phase-space volume wherein the first-order perturbation becomes unphysical. The volume of these subregions of phase-space and, therefore, the corresponding contribution to macroscopic quantities increases with the strength of nonequilibrium (equivalently, the gradients of physical observables). Physical interpretation and performance of the metric are examined for a nonreactive sonic boundary layer flow. The metric provides the first apriori estimate of uncertainties on physical observables computed from the Navier-Stokes equations. The assigned uncertainties can be propagated in the flow field to assess the applicability of the Navier-Stokes equations for flows with strong nonequilibrium and/or rarefied gas physics.},

 abstract = {A recombination reaction model for high-temperature chemical kinetics is analytically derived from ab initio simulation data. When atoms recombine, the kinetic rate model shows that product molecules favor high vibrational energy states. In this manner, recombination repopulates high vibrational energy states depleted by dissociation, in a high-temperature reacting gas. Coupling of internal energy relaxation, dissociation, and recombination results in depleted or overpopulated (relative to a corresponding Boltzmann distribution) vibrational energy distributions. Through a simple model, we show that non-Boltzmann behavior, in other words, depletion or overpopulation of high-energy states, is not only linked to thermal nonequilibrium but also chemical nonequilibrium. The mathematical derivation also indicates that the conventional approach for modeling recombination rates, where shock-tube dissociation rate measurements are combined with the principle of detailed balance, is incorrect. The complete analytical dissociation/recombination model embeds all relevant kinetic processes, including specific terms for translation/rotation/vibration/chemistry coupling, anharmonic and quasi-bound effects, and non-Boltzmann depletion and overpopulation effects. The model is a multitemperature model that can be used within computational fluid dynamics simulations with no appreciable increase in computational expense. Finally, because the model is analytical, containing separate terms for various physical effects, further model simplification could be performed depending on the flow conditions of interest.},

Current studies on this subject often make many simplifications, focus on a specific physical process, or include flow conditions different from those on Mars. To address this, we perform computational fluid dynamics simulations of hypersonic dusty flows over a full-scale entry capsule based on a realistic flight trajectory. The simulations are performed with an Euler–Lagrange methodology in which the carrier gas solution is obtained with a discontinuous Galerkin method. We employ a recently developed physics-based drag correlation that obtains better agreement with experimental data than popular existing correlations. To improve understanding of the relevant physical processes, which are still not very well understood, the effects of various factors, such as particle size distribution, angle of attack, and two-way coupling, on dust-induced heating augmentation and erosion are assessed.},

 abstract = {Nanoconfined fluids exhibit remarkably different thermodynamic behavior compared to the bulk phase. These confinement effects render predictions of thermodynamic quantities of nanoconfined fluids challenging. In particular, confinement creates a spatially varying density profile near the wall that is primarily responsible for adsorption and capillary condensation behavior. Significant fluctuations in thermodynamic quantities, inherent in such nanoscale systems, coupled to strong fluid-wall interactions give rise to this near-wall density profile. Empirical models have been proposed to explain and model these effects, yet no first-principles based formulation has been developed. We present a statistical mechanics framework that embeds such a coupling to describe the effect of the fluid-wall interaction in amplifying the near-wall density behavior for compressible gases at elevated pressures such as pressurized methane in confinement. We show that the proposed theory predicts accurately the adsorbed layer thickness as obtained with small-angle neutron scattering measurements. Furthermore, the predictions of density under confinement from the proposed theory are shown to be in excellent agreement with available experimental and atomistic simulations data for a range of temperatures for nanoconfined methane. While the framework is presented for evaluating the near-wall density, owing to its rigorous foundation in statistical mechanics, the proposed theory can also be generalized for predicting phase-transition and nonequilibrium transport of nanoconfined fluids.},
