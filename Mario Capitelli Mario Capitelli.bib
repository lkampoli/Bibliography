The analysis of these systems based on their microscopic properties as accessible with PIC gives improved insight into their complex behavior. These studies are results of joint efforts over about one decade of research groups from Greifswald University, Germany; Bari University, Italy; Keio University, Japan and Innsbruck University, Austria.

The results show a temporal evolution of the electron energy distribution due to the corresponding evolution of the vibrational distribution and of the concentration of atoms arising from the dissociation process. The superelastic vibrational collisions are the main cause of this evolution. The calculated edf's are then used to obtain quantities such as drift velocity, average and characteristic energy and rate coefficients for ionization, vibrational and electronic excitation processes. All these quantities exhibit a similar temporal evolution following the temporal evolution of the edf. In particular the rate coefficients for ionization and electronic excitation, which depend on the high energy portion, present variations of several orders of magnitude.},

 abstract = {Electron energy distribution functions (EDF) in SiH4, SiH4−H2 radiofrequency discharges have been calculated by solving the time-dependent Boltzmann equation in the presence of a sinusoidal field. Particular emphasis is given to the modulation of EDF as a function of the applied frequency (π·106≤ω/p0≤π·108 sec−1 torr−1) and of gas composition. The results show that at ω/p0= π·106 sec−1 torr−1 EDF follows in a quasistationary mode the variation of the field with the exception of a small range of electric field near to the zero crossing. Still, at the higher considered frequency (ω/p0=π·108 sec−1 torr−1), we observe some modulation of EDF. The necessity of using a time-dependent approach is tested by comparing the present results with the corresponding ones obtained by using the effective field approximation (i.e., the approximation which solves instead of the time-dependent Boltzmann equation the corresponding stationary one at the effective values$$E = E_o /\sqrt 2$$ of the rf field). The two sets of results can differ by orders of magnitude in the tail of EDF, the differences decreasing with increasing molar fraction of H2 and increasing field frequency. The role of excited states (second-kind collisions) is studied by inserting in the Boltzmann equation given concentrations of vibrational and electronic states. The results show that second-kind collisions strongly affect EDF especially in pure silane. Finally a satisfactory agreement has been found between theoretical and experimental results concerning the modulation of electrons of given energy in pure silane discharges.},

The amount of heat received by the particles can thus be calculated as a function of the distance.The results have been examined on the assumption that the rate-determining step of the decomposition process is the transfer of heat across the boundary layer surrounding the particles. The coefficients of heat transfer in the presence of mass counterflow have been evaluated from the transport properties of argon and from the thermodynamic data of the decomposition process. The equation of motion of the particles has been determined by assuming the validity of Stoke's law. It is concluded that the experimental results can be satisfactorily discussed on the assumption of reaction control by heat transfer.},

 abstract = {We study the process of resonant charge exchange involving excited helium atoms with the principal quantum number n = 5 colliding with the helium ion in the ground state in the collision energy range from thermal up to 10 eV. This information may be important for the analysis of planet atmospheres containing helium, in particular, for Jupiter’s atmosphere, but our basic interest is the transition from the quantum to classical description of this process, where, due to large cross sections, evaluations of the cross sections are possible. For the chosen process, quantum theory allows determining the cross section as a result of a tunnel electron transition, while classical theory accounts for over-barrier electron transitions. The classical theory additionally requires effective transitions between states with close energies. The analysis of these transitions for helium with n = 5 shows that electron momenta and their projections are mixed for a part of the states, while for other states, the mixing is absent. A simple criterion to separate such states is given. In addition, the main contribution to the cross section of resonant charge exchange follows from tunnel electron transitions. As a result, the quantum theory is better for calculating the cross sections of resonant charge exchange than the classical one and also allows finding the partial cross sections of resonant charge exchange, while the classical approach gives the cross section of resonant charge exchange in a simple manner with the accuracy of 20%.},

It is shown that the plasma optical thickness plays a major role on the evolution of macroscopic quantities and internal distributions along the nozzle axis. Structured electron energy distribution functions, characterized by long plateaux and humps, are created due to superelastic collisions of cold electrons and electronically excited atomic hydrogen. The magnitudes of the plateaux are orders of magnitude higher in an optically thick plasma compared with a thin plasma, while the electron-electron collisions play a role in smoothing the peaks created by superelastic collisions between cold electrons and H(n>2).},

The rearrangement of the water structure and the subsequent photon absorption by free electrons raising the breakdown threshold occur. Moreover, charge separation in bulk water, under laser induced electromagnetic field, leads to a notable enhancement of the SRS signal. On the other hand, for a high laser pulse energy density, electrons gain energy enough to escape from the hydrating water structure, generating electron impact dominated plasma.},

In particular EEDF strongly deviating from the Maxwell behaviour appear as a consequence of inelastic and superelastic collisions at relatively high pressure and long period. Also, strong oscillation appears on the tail of the H2 vibrational distribution at high pressure discharge conditions. At low pressure, the effect of superelastic and inelastic collisions appears to be less significant and most of the plasma characteristics may be deduced from a time averaged electron energy distribution function.},

 abstract = {It is quite frequent in chemical kinetics, in combustion studies or in meteorology, to use large computational models that depend - generally in a non-linear fashion - on a certain number of “parameters”, that is quantities, fixed during the model calculation, that allow to modify the model behaviour in order to fit it to the specific problem studied. Often these parameters are not well known (typically, cross sections or rate constants in chemical kinetics). When the number of parameters to be fitted is low (less than three or four, for example), generally it is relatively easy to search for the better values by simply varying the parameters in some ordered way and comparing the obtained results with experimental knowledge of the investigated phenomenon. But that is impossible to do if the parameters to be varied are tenths, because of the huge computational effort and memory storage capacity requested, which grow as a power of the number of varied parameters. In this case, a workable strategy is to reduce as much as possible the number of parameters to be adjusted, leaving fixed the “less important” ones, that is those parameters not largely affecting the output of the model, when restricted to specified intervals. Sensitivity analysis is a tool to know the “importance” of each parameter, once its variation interval has been assigned (this last could be the parameter incertitude around the experimental value, or the allowed range of variation of a controllable quantity).},

The results show that under a laser pump of 106s−1 dissociation of HCl can occur as a result of the V-V up-pumping mechanism, which transports up to the top of the HCl vibrational ladder the vibrational quanta introduced by the laser pump over the first few vibrational levels of HCl. The influence of the gas temperatureT on the dissociation rate is discussed either for the isothermal problem or for the nonisothermal one. At high pumping rates an increase ofT decreases the dissociation rate (300 K<T<1000 K) as a result of the destruction of V-V up-pumping mechanism at high temperature.},

The two-term expansion of the electron Boltzmann equation is solved for determining the electron energy distribution function (EEDF), which is used to estimate the rates of chemical reactions and of energy transfer between electrons and heavy species. These rates are then used in a one-dimensional transport model, which enables estimation of species concentrations and plasma temperatures. Results show that, in the considered plasmas, the electron-heavy species reaction rates depend mainly on the average electron energy. The assumption of a Maxwellian EEDF leads to a strong overestimation of the ionization degree (which is approximately equal to the electron mole fraction) and to the underestimation of H-atom density and average electron energy. The predicted gas and vibration temperature are only slightly affected by such an assumption.},

 abstract = {This chapter deals with the study of nonequilibrium vibrational distributions created by the so-called vibration-vibration (V-V) up-pumping mechanism [2.1] (or Treanor’s mechanism) and with the effects of such a mechanism on chemical reactions of diatomic molecules. Treanor’s mechanism is responsible for the overpopulation of the vibrational distribution of a diatomic molecule under physical conditions characterized by large vibrational temperatures [θ1 = E10/k ln(N0/N1)] and small transiational ones (Tg). (E10 is the energy difference between level 1 and level 0, N1 and N2 being the corresponding population densities; k is Boltzmann’s constant.) Indeed, in this case V-V energy exchanges are more effective than vibration-translation (V-T) ones thus creating a quasi-stationary vibrational distribution made up of a Treanor’s distribution for the low-lying vibrational levels, a plateau, and a tail. The extension of this plateau depends on the effectiveness of V-V rates in overcoming the V-T ones [2.2–5].},

The results have been obtained for different reduced field frequencies omega ( pi *104<or= omega <or= pi *107 s-1 Torr-1), while the field amplitude E0/p0 has been self-consistently calculated by imposing an electron balance during the period between the gain by ionisation processes and the losses by dissociative attachment and ambipolar diffusion. Different fixed concentrations of excited states have also been considered to understand the role of superelastic collisions as well as ionisation and attachment from excited states in affecting EEDF. The results at the fixed omega /p0 show that the presence of excited states strongly decreases the modulation of EEDF enlarging its tail at the same time. Moreover the ionisation frequency from excited Xe* is such as to decrease the self-consistent field amplitude necessary to sustain the electrical discharge. Finally the results for different field frequencies show that a complete quasi-stationary situation is only reached at Gw approximately pi *104 s-1 Torr-1.},

 abstract = {Calculations of the electron energy distribution and of relevant macroscopic quantities of collision-dominated, weakly ionized plasmas under rf field action have been performed with increasing degrees of ionization, and the impact of the electron-electron interaction on these quantities was determined. The investigations were performed for the gas plasmas in CO and H2 as representatives of molecular plasmas The energy distribution and macroscopic quantities are obtained by solving the nonstationary Bolizmann equation for a given rf field and degree of ionization taking into accoung and additional Fokker-Planck term besides the collision integrals for the elastic and the main inelastic collision processes. In these molecular plasmas a remarkable impact of the electron-electron interaction connected with increasing Maxwellization is observed for degrees of ionization greater than 10.},

 abstract = {A theoretical investigation of the electron and phonon time-dependent distributions in an Ag film subjected to a femtosecond laser pulse has been carried out. A system of two coupled time-dependent Boltzmann equations, describing electron and phonon dynamics, has been numerically solved. In the electron Boltzmann equation, electron–electron and electron–phonon collision integrals are considered together with a source term for laser perturbation. In the phonon Boltzmann equation, only electron–phonon collisions are considered, neglecting laser perturbation and phonon–phonon collisions. Screening of the interactions has been accounted for in both the electron–electron and the electron–phonon collisions. The results show the simultaneous electron and phonon time-dependent distributions from the initial non-equilibrium behaviour up to the establishment of a new final equilibrium condition.},

The interaction of the ion charge with the atom quadrupole moment is important for this system along with the exchange interactions and spin-orbit interactions inside an isolated atom and an ion. The quadrupole moment for 3d-atoms in the ground states is evaluated. The hierarchy of interactions in a molecular ion is analyzed depending on ion-atom distances and is compared with the standard Hund scheme. The resonant charge exchange proceeds effectively at separations corresponding to an intermediate case between cases “a” and “c” of the Hund coupling scheme.},

 abstract = {Some of the recent efforts in the state-to-state modeling of H/H2-based plasma are considered, with particular concern to the aspects of self-consistent coupling between the chemical kinetics, electron kinetics and radiation. These aspects are first illustrated in the case of a 0-dimensional model considering both optically thin and optically thick cases in recombining and ionizing regimes. In the second part of the paper, a 1-dimensional extension of the model is applied to study a steady normal shock generated in an H2/He plasma of interest in atmospheric entry problems. A radiation transfer equation is coupled to the model as well, to analyze the effect of radiation transfer on chemical kinetics and compare to the commonly used thin and thick plasma approximations. The most significant result is the influence of reabsorption on the concentration of excited states, which in turn creates additional structure on the electron energy distribution function through second kind collisions.},

 abstract = {Electron energy distribution functions (EDF) under N2 discharge and post-discharge conditions have been calculated by self-consistently solving the Boltzmann equation, the vibrational master equation (including dissociation) and the kinetics of the most important electronic states of N2. The results show that the relaxation of EDF in the post-discharge is strongly linked to the residence time of N2 in the discharge, which determines the initial conditions. In particular at low residence times the role of metastable states in affecting EDF through superelastic electronic collisions (SEC) overcomes the corresponding one from superelastic vibrational collisions (SVC). On the contrary, SVC dominate at long residence times, when a well-developed vibrational distribution has been built up by the discharge. At intermediate residence times both SVC and SEC affect the relaxation of EDF, which in general presents a non-monotonic behaviour.},

A satisfactory agreement is found between the present ν=0 cross sections and corresponding theoretical and experimental results for the processes leading to unexcited H*(n= 1) and excited H*(n= 2–5) fragments. The role of vibrational excitation in affecting cross sections is such to decrease the threshold energy and to increase the maximum value of the cross section. This behaviour holds for all processes, with the exception of cross sections leading to H*(n= 2). In this last case the maximum value of the cross sections increases with increasing the vibrational quantum number ν for ν⩽5, having an opposite behaviour for ν>5.},

A particular aspect of this plasma is the distinctly resonance-like behavior of the vibrational excitation of the CO molecules by electron collisions. This causes the lumped frequencies for energy and impulse dissipation in collisions, recently introduced in the study of the rf kinetics in Ne and H2, to become extremely dependent on the electron energy. Despite this fact, it could be verified that the field frequency dependence of the temporal evolution of the electron kinetics can be interpreted by means of these two dissipation frequencies even under such complicated conditions as given by the atomic data in CO.},

 abstract = {Electron energy distribution functions (EEDFS) in RF collision dominated N2 discharges have been calculated by solving the time-dependent Boltzmann equation including elastic, inelastic and superelastic collisions. The results have been obtained at different field amplitudes E0/ rho 0 (10<or=E0/ rho 0<or=20 V cm-1 Torr-1), at different frequencies omega / rho 0 ( pi *106<or= omega / rho 0<or= pi *108 s-1 Torr -1) and different concentrations of excited (vibrational and electronic) states. It has been found that the presence of excited states strongly modified the modulation of the tail of EEDFS with strong consequences on the collision frequencies of processes having high energy thresholds. The role of field frequency is studied for the understanding of both the temporal behaviour of EEDFS and the averaged (over the period) values of EEDFS and of macroscopic quantities. The authors obtain that at fixed E0/ rho 0 the increase of frequency decreases the tail of EEDFS, strongly reducing the collision frequency of the ionisation process. Finally the importance of the time-dependent solution of the Boltzmann equation is tested by comparing the present results with the corresponding ones obtained by using the effective field approximation. Differences up to several orders of magnitude are obtained in this comparison, the differences being reduced at high E0/ rho 0, high omega / rho 0 and large concentrations of excited states.},

In this mechanism, called joint vibro-electronic mechanism (JVE), the electrons of the discharge create a strong vibrational disequilibrium with respect to the gas temperature (Tg) and promote electronic transitions from all vibrational levels of 1Σg H2 state to the repulsive 3Σu one. Moreover the V-V (vibration-vibration) and V-T (vibration-translation) energy exchanges are considered for building up the vibrational distribution of 1Σg state. A complete set of e - D cross sections (e + H2(1Σg,ν) → e + H2 (3Σu) → + 2H, ν = 0,14) is calculated by using an extension of the semiclassical Gryzinski theory in combination with the Franck-Condon principle. Dissociation rates calculated according to JVE are larger either than those obtained by the pure vibrational mechanism (PVM) discussed in our previous work or than those from the direct electronic impact mechanism (DEM) from the ground vibrational level. The behaviour of JVE rates as a function of gas temperature (Tg), of E/N, of electron density (ne) and of pressure is then reported. The results show strong differences as compared, with the corresponding values obtained, with PVM. Finally the influence of the atoms as well as their recombination on the dissociation rates is discussed. The results have been obtained by solving a system of vibrational master equations.},

A self-consistent approach for the thermodynamic properties and higher order approximation of the Chapman–Enskog method for the transport coefficients have been used. Debye–Hückel corrections have been included in the calculation of thermodynamic properties while collision integrals derived following a phenomenological approach and accounting also for resonant processes contributions have been used. Moreover, charge–charge interactions have been obtained by using a screened Coulomb potential. Calculated values have been fitted by closed forms ready to be inserted in fluid dynamic codes in order to simulate plasma conditions for different technological applications. Comparison with data present in literature is also reported.},

It is shown that properties of single species are strongly affected by the cut-off criterion adopted, i. e. the contribution of electronic excitation to these properties is important. It is also shown that the reported absence of this contribution to total enthalpies and specific heats of plasmas is the result of an almost complete compensation between "reactional" and "frozen" terms which are all dependent on electronic excitation.},

 abstract = {Abstract  Electron energy distribution functions and mean collision frequencles for the uniform bulk plasma of established rf discharges in He/CO have been obtained by solving the time dependent Boltzmann equation. The results, which are of importance for plasma processing and laser technology, show that already small CO admixtures to He remarkably changes the periodic behaviour of the energy distribution of the electrons by drastical enhancement of the collisional energy dissipation effectiveness in the mixture. These changes can be interpreted on the basis of a lumped energy dissipation frequency in all electron collisions which is determined by the atomic data of the electron collision processes as well as by the admixture fractions and which drastically increases with increasing CO admixture. The degree of modulation of the energy distribution in different parts of the electron energy space and its population on the time average at higher energies are determined by the relation between the rf field frequency and the mentioned lumped energy dissipation frequency. },

 abstract = {IntroductionThe research on high-energy shock wave is a field of large interest including nuclear explosion, hypersonic flows as well as laser forming plasmas. During the relevant interaction a high-temperature, high-pressure plasma is formed, which in some cases can be ascribed to the family of thermal plasmas, characterized by equilibrium between the different degrees of freedom, including chemical and internal ones. Thermal plasmas can be described by equilibrium chemical thermodynamics, in particular statistical thermodynamics is used in this field to get information about the input data (entropy, enthalpy and specific heat of single species). Thermal plasmas are usually characterized by a single temperature for all species, including the vibrationally, rotationally and electronically distributions among the excited states, while dissociation and ionization (Saha) equilibria characterize them. On the other hand thermal plasmas with different temperatures are still accepted in this kind of literature, the different temperatures characterizing the corresponding reservoirs of energy. The internal distributions are still Boltzmann at a given (different) temperature; chemical equilibrium thermodynamics again characterizes the plasma properties even though caution must be exercised in using it. Typical conditions for thermal plasmas are temperatures in the range of 5 000-50 000 K, pressure in the 10− 2-103 atm. range and ionization degree larger than 10− 5.},

 abstract = {Abstract  The temporal collision dominated relaxation of electrons to new stationary states, starting from initial stationary states and due to jump‐like changes of the electric field, was studied in the plasmas of the molecular gases N 2 and CO. Numerical solving of the time dependent Boltzmann equation for the electrons yields the temporal evolution of their energy distribution function and of resulting macroscopic quantities. The varying relaxation due to different values of the field strength in the final stationary state has been investigated considering the molecules of the plasma only as vibrationally non‐excited and, in another case, including the additional impact of collisions with vibrationally excited molecules. The results obtained are discussed and, in particular, the relaxation times found for the transitions to the new stationary states are analysed on the basis of the energy transfer effectiveness by the collision processes. An approximative microphysical basis for the understanding of the main features of the relaxation in such complex molecular gas plasmas could be obtained. 
 Die Relaxation der Elektronen zu stationären Zuständen in stoßbestimmten Plasmen in molekularen Gasen   Ausgehend von stationären Anfangszuständen und verursacht durch sprungartige Veränderung des elektrischen Feldes wurde die zeitliche stoßbestimmte Relaxation von Elektronen zu neuen stationären Zuständen in Plasmen der molekularen Gase N 2 und CO 2 untersucht. Die numerische Lösung der zeitabhängigen Boltzmann‐Gleichung für die Elektronen liefert die zeitliche Entwicklung ihrer Energieverteilungsfunktion und hieraus folgender makroskopischer Größen.

 abstract = {The classification of meteorites when geological analysis is unfeasible is generally made by the spectral line emission ratio of some characteristic elements. Indeed when a meteorite impacts Earth's atmosphere, hot plasma is generated, as a consequence of the braking effect of air, with the consequent ablation of the falling body. Usually, by the plasma emission spectrum, the meteorite composition is determined, assuming the Boltzmann equilibrium. The plasma generated during Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) experiment shows similar characteristics and allows one to verify the mentioned method with higher accuracy. On the other hand the study of Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy on meteorite can be useful for both improving meteorite classification methods and developing on-flight techniques for asteroid investigation.In this paper certified meteorites belonging to different typologies have been investigated by LIBS: Dofhar 461 (lunar meteorite), Chondrite L6 (stony meteorite), Dofhar 019 (Mars meteorite) and Sikhote Alin (irony meteorite).},

 abstract = {A PIC-MCC/fluid hybrid model was employed to study a parallel-plate capacitively coupled radio-frequency discharge in hydrogen, under the application of a dc bias voltage. When a negative dc voltage was applied to one of the electrodes of a continuous wave (cw) plasma, a ‘beam’ of secondary electrons was formed that struck the substrate counter-electrode at nearly normal incidence. The energy distribution of the electrons striking the substrate extended all the way to VRF + |Vdc|, the sum of the peak RF voltage and the absolute value of the applied dc bias. Such directional, energetic electrons may be useful for ameliorating charging damage in etching of high aspect ratio nano-features. The vibrational distribution function of molecular hydrogen was calculated self-consistently, and was found to have a characteristic plateau for intermediate values of the vibrational quantum number, v. When a positive dc bias voltage was applied synchronously during a specified time window in the afterglow of a pulsed plasma, the ion energy distributions (IEDs) of positive ions acquired an extra peak at an energy equivalent of the applied dc voltage. The electron energy distribution function was slightly and temporarily heated during the application of the dc bias pulse. The calculated IEDs of  and  ions in a cw plasma without dc bias were found to be in good agreement with published experimental data.},

 abstract = {A comparison of two different theoretical approaches reported in the literature to model kinetic processes in N2 discharges is presented and discussed. One of these approaches is directly concerned with steady-state conditions and the other analysis with the evolution of the properties of the medium from a cold gas situation up to nearly equilibrium conditions as time evolves. Both approaches are based on solutions to the coupled system of the electron Boltzman equation and the kinetic equations for the N2(X,v) vibrational levels, but they differ by the approximations used to model atomic recombination processes and by the choice of collisional data. The conclusions drawn from both models are qualitatively in agreement as to the important role of the coupling between the electron and the vibrational kinetics. However, due to the different data and recombination models used different results are obtained for equilibrium conditions, namely for that concerning the rate of dissociation, the degree of vibrational excitation, and the electron rate coefficients. In particular, the present analysis shows that a deeper knowledge of atomic recombination processes is necessary in order to improve the reliability of both models.},

 abstract = {Nonequilibrium vibrational distributions and dissociation rates of molecular oxygen in both electrical and thermal conditions have been calculated by solving a system of master equations including V-V (vibration-vibration), V-T (vibration-translation) and e-V (electron-vibration) energy exchanges. The dissociation constant under thermal conditions (i.e. without electrons) follows an Arrhenius law with an activation energy of 120 kcal/mole, while the corresponding rates under electrical conditions (5000 ⩽ Te ⩽ 15000 K, 300 ⩽ Tg ⩽ 1000 K, 1011 ⩽ ne ⩽ 1012 cm−3,5 ⩽ p ⩽ 20 torr) increase with decreasing gas (Tg) and electron (Te) temperatures and pressure (p) and with increasing electron density (ne). These results are explained on the basis of the different interplay of V-V and V-T energy exchanges and are rationalized by means of simplified models proposed in the literature. The accuracy of the present results is discussed paying particular attention to the dependence of V-V and V-T rate coefficients on the vibrational quantum number. A comparison of the calculated dissociation rates with the corresponding ones obtained by the direct electron impact mechanism shows that the present mechanism prevails at low electron and gas temperatures. Finally a comparison is shown between theoretical and experimental dissociation rates under electrical and thermal conditions.},

 abstract = {Abstract  The influence of oxygen atoms on the population densities of vibrational levels of molecular oxygen has been studied for discharge conditions in which the atoms come 1) from electronic transitions to Herzberg and Schumann systems 2) from the pure vibrational mechanism (PVM) discussed in Chem. Phys. 30 (1978) 95.   In the first case the atoms deactivate the first vibrational levels of O 2 , thus reducing the vibrational temperature and the propagation of the introduced vibrational quanta by V — V exchanges.  Under these conditions PVM disappears. An assisted recombination dissociation mechanism, however, holds in these conditions, due to the recombination process which induces a strong disequilibrium on the levels near to the dissociation continuum. These levels can redissociate by collisions with heavy particles.  The results of pure vibrational mechanism in the presence of atoms are very similar to those discussed in our previous work. The production of oxygen atoms self adjusts to small values due to the increased importance of V — T deactivation by oxygen atoms. },

The first part of the paper reports on the development of a detailed collisional radiative model for moderate pressure pure H2 plasma. Several effects related to electron kinetics, H2 vibrational kinetics and H2 and H excited states kinetics and their effect on the overall dissociation and ionization kinetics are analysed with the model developed. This allows us to propose a reduced model which can be used for the self-consistent modelling of H2 discharges or as the modelling of the more complex H2/CH4 plasmas. The second part of the paper deals with the two-dimensional self consistent modelling of H2 plasmas obtained in a microwave cavity coupling system. The procedure used for coupling the plasma transport equations to the electromagnetic field equations is first discussed and some self-consistent simulation results with respect to the power deposition and plasma temperature and density distributions in the investigated plasma device are given. The last part of the work addresses the one-dimensional transport modelling of H2/CH4 plasmas used for diamond deposition. The spatial variations of neutral and charged hydrocarbon species densities on the reactor axis are presented and the main phenomena and processes that govern these variations are discussed.},

 abstract = {Numerical simulations are performed to assess the possibility of using different kinds of electrical discharges operating in dry air under normal conditions as ozone generators. The ozone production and NOx destruction efficiency are investigated as a function of discharge parameters such as the reduced electric field, the energy deposition, and the electron density. The specific energy deposition becomes a key parameter to compare the different classes of ozonators. During the operative phase the electric discharge produces an appreciable amount of nitrogen oxides. Taking into consideration both the active phase of flue gas processing and the post-discharge phase it is possible to achieve a good NOx-removal efficiency even for initial concentrations as high as 1000 ppm. The main processes and characteristic times are discussed.},

The analysis emphasizes the role of mathematical virtual procedures in determining the equilibrium conditions and the irrelevance of physico-chemical transformations that bring the system into the equilibrium state. Different examples, including a new derivation of Saha’s equation, are dealt with to validate this conceptual approach.},

The strict timeresolved treatment is based on the nonstationary Boltzmann equation of the electrons and its numerical solution including, apart from electron number conservative collision processes, the electron attachment and ionization. The investigations are related to an rf plasma in a model gas and in SF6 and are performed for reduced rf field frequencies around 10 MHz Torr−1 which are of particular interest from the point of application of rf discharges for plasma processing. The numerical results show that a large field amplitude of around 160 V cm−1 Torr−1 is necessary to maintain the discharge and that the isotropic distribution, the relevant collision frequencies for attachment and ionization, and the electron density undergo a large modulation during a period of the rf field.},

This model involves three groups of reactions which describe the vibrational kinetics of H2, the chemistry of H2 and H electronically excited states and the groundstate species kinetics, respectively. The set of species kinetic equations resulting from this model, coupled to the electron Boltzmann equation and the total energy equation were solved under a quasi-homogenous plasma assumption. This enables the estimation of the species densities, the electron distribution function and related electron properties, as well as the gas temperature. The results show that the most important ionization channel is that due to the quenching of H (n = 2) excited states by H2. The production of the H-atom is mainly due to electron impact dissociation at low microwave power density and to thermal dissociation at high power density. A simplified physical model which may be used for describing the non-equilibrium H2 plasma flow in diamond deposition microwave plasmas reactors is also proposed.},

 abstract = {Abstract  It has been shown experimentally that the channel wall material has a substantial effect on the behaviour of Hall discharges. For this reason, the radial profile inside the Hall thruster SPT‐100 is investigated in detail. This is done by a one‐dimensional fully kinetic self‐consistent Particle‐in‐Cell model between the two walls in the acceleration region of the channel. A detailed Monte Carlo probabilistic model for secondary electron emission is implemented as boundary module. Using the local field approximation, two different operative conditions (axial electric field E  z  =100 V/cm and 300 V/cm) have been simulated. For high discharge voltage case, a strong radial asymmetry and a stream instability propagating all along the radial domain are detected, while in the low voltage case a stable classical situation is recovered. The critical parameters for triggering this unstable regime are the electron azimuthal drift energy and the induced secondary electron emission, while the saturation mechanism is the increasing of the temperature of the initially cold secondary‐electrons.

 abstract = {Starting from former investigations of the field-free, collision-dominated temporal relaxation of the electron component in the postdiscarge regime for inert- and molecular-gas plasmas, we studied, in hydrogen, the effect of additional electron collisions with vibrationally excited behavhour. By numerically solving the appropriate electron Boltzmann equation, using the stationary distributions as initial states and suddenly switching off the electric field, the temporal behaviour of the energy distribution and the resulting mean energy and power transfer rates of the electrons were obtained for different physical conditions. Via the introduction of effective collision cross-sections and corresponding effective collision frequencies, the relaxation under different conditions can be analysed and interpreted. The relaxation between temporal evolutions and different types of collision processes have been found. Interesting findings are i) that electron collisions with vibrationally excited molecules, in particular second-kind collisions, are of minor importance in the first stage of relaxation, but become relevant only in the later phase; ii) that an increasing mixture of atoms leads to a sensitive change of the relaxation behaviour and to a marked increase of the corresponding relaxation time.},

In this work we present the electro-optical properties of devices based on randomly oriented diamond films, synthesized in a microwave plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition reactor. A comparative study on devices with coplanar interdigitated Cr/Au electrodes (with different interelectrode pitches) made of films grown simultaneously on intrinsic and p-doped silicon (100) substrates has been performed. The chemical–structural, morphological, electrical and optical properties of ROD films have been studied. In particular, the optical response has been measured in air using a Xe flash lamp coupled with an optical quartz fiber and a properly tailored front-end electronics based on a charge sensitive amplifier. Experimental results gave indications on how the device performances are dependent on the two types of employed substrates.},

 abstract = {Soil is unanimously considered as one of the most important sink of heavy metals released by human activities. Heavy metal analysis of natural and polluted soils is generally conducted by the use of atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) or inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on adequately obtained soil extracts. Although in recent years the emergent technique of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has been applied widely and with increasing success for the qualitative and quantitative analyses of a number of heavy metals in soil matrices with relevant simplification of the conventional methodologies, the technique still requires further confirmation before it can be applied fully successfully in soil analyses. The main objective of this work was to demonstrate that new developments in LIBS technique are able to provide reliable qualitative and quantitative analytical evaluation of several heavy metals in soils, with special focus on the element chromium (Cr), and with reference to the concentrations measured by conventional ICP spectroscopy. The preliminary qualitative LIBS analysis of five soil samples and one sewage sludge sample has allowed the detection of a number of elements including Al, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Pb, Si, Ti, V and Zn. Of these, a quantitative analysis was also possible for the elements Cr, Cu, Pb, V and Zn based on the obtained linearity of the calibration curves constructed for each heavy metal, i.e., the proportionality between the intensity of the LIBS emission peaks and the concentration of each heavy metal in the sample measured by ICP. In particular, a triplet of emission lines for Cr could be used for its quantitative measurement. The consistency of experiments made on various samples was supported by the same characteristics of the laser-induced plasma (LIP), i.e., the typical linear distribution confirming the existence of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) condition, and similar excitation temperatures and comparable electron number density measured for all samples. An index of the anthropogenic contribution of Cr in polluted soils was calculated in comparison to a non-polluted reference soil. Thus, the intensity ratios of the emission lines of heavy metal can be used to detect in few minutes the polluted areas for which a more detailed sampling and analysis can be useful.},

All electronic rate coefficients follow a temporal evolution. due to the corresponding evolution of edf.

The results show that population inversions can be obtained for both quasistationary and fast, transient, recombining plasmas. In this case, the lasing durations of the transitions O(I) 3p3P-3s3S, 3p5P-3s5S and N(I) 3s2P-2p2D, 3s2P-2p2P0 are of the same order of magnitude as the collisional relaxation times of the original states.},

 abstract = {A two-dimensional in space and three-dimensional in velocity, fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) model of the atom (Xe), ion (Xe+) and electron dynamics of a stationary plasma thruster is developed. Electron-neutral elastic scattering, excitation and ionization processes are modelled by Monte Carlo collision methodology. The interaction of the plasma discharge with the ceramic walls leads to plasma recombination, energy loss and secondary electron. These phenomena are included into the model by different approaches. The electric field is self-consistently solved from the Poisson equation, while the magnetostatic field is precomputed. The code is applied to a scaled SPT thruster geometry where fundamental physics parameters are kept constant. The model is found to be able to reproduce the discharge ignition dynamics. The numerical results will provide a better understanding of the experimentally observed enhanced axial electron current and high frequency oscillations.},

These can cause the presence of repulsed and trapped ions in the region surrounding a negatively biased Langmuir probe, invalidating the orbital motion limited (OML) theory. In this work, a Particle‐In‐Cell/Test‐Particle Monte Carlo (PIC/TPMC) model of Ar plasma at medium gas pressure has been developed in order to show the effect of ion‐neutral collisions. In fact, the results of the present simulation for different discharge pressures demonstrate the complex structure of electric potential around the probe and the failure of analytical theories.

In this regime, production of negative hydrogen ions can occur, mainly through vibrational excited molecule or by negative surface ionization of hydrogen ions. To study this effect, we have developed a 1D-3V Particle-in-Cell electrostatic model of the electro-negative sheath. The motion of charged particles (e, H+, H2+ and H−) in their self-consistent electric field and of excited neutral-particle states (H(n=1,2,3) and H2(X1Σg+,v=0,…,14)) is simulated. Surface and volumetric processes have been included by using different Monte Carlo Collision methods. The importance of negative ions for the sheath potential and hydrogen fluxes on to the divertor will be calculated for different parameters.},

 abstract = {The simultaneous time evolution of electron and phonon distributions in a gold film submitted to a femtosecond laser pulse has been theoretically investigated. A system of two coupled time-dependent Boltzmann equations describing electron and phonon dynamics has been solved by considering electron–electron (e–e) and electron–phonon (e–p) collisions. Phonon–phonon (p–p) collisions have been neglected. The collision probability of each process is derived by quantum-mechanical first order perturbation theory. The injected laser energy (source term) is directly absorbed by the electron gas through electron–photon collisions and a perturbation term is added to the Boltzmann equation for electrons. However, phonons do not directly absorb energy from the laser but they are affected by the irradiation due to their collisional interaction with electrons. The results emphasize the transient non-equilibrium behavior of the electron distribution function and details of electron and phonon relaxation dynamics.},

The optimization of the DP-LIBS emission signal and the determination of the lower detection limit, in a set of experiments reported in the current scientific literature, clearly demonstrate the feasibility and the advantages of this technique for underwater applications.},

 abstract = {Aims.We study the relevance of including vibrational levels of molecular hydrogen in one of the processes taking place in the primordial Universe: the dissociative attachment of H2. Methods. We calculated the rate of dissociative attachment of H2, covering the contribution of all vibrational levels in standard conditions for primordial Universe chemistry. We then compared this rate to the rates of other chemical processes relevant for H2 balance as a function of z. Results.It is shown that vibrationally excited levels of molecular hydrogen cannot be neglected in evaluating the rate of dissociative attachment in early Universe conditions and that this process is one of the most relevant channels for destruction of H2 molecules at z ≈103. We also propose a preliminary estimation of the effect of a possible non-equilibrium vibrational distribution on the results.},

In particular we have solved the electron momentum conservation equation (including collisional and magnetic effects) and the electron energy conservation equation (including collisional effects). Due to the difference between electron and ion Larmor radius and to the effect of the thruster wall, the quasi-neutrality hypothesis can be violated in the very-near-field plume region and the electric field must be computed accordingly. The xenon atom flowfield is calculated analytically. The model allows a unitary rationalization of several experimental observations.},

The model includes the process of secondary electron emission from the dielectric walls. In order to allow for a realistic simulation, differently from the previous fully kinetic model using a dummy mass ratio and vacuum permittivity or neglecting radial effects, a geometrical scaling of the channel is applied keeping the main dimensionless physics parameters constant. By this, the problem of the computational limits due to the very fast electron dynamics can be overcome. This model is able to give a clear picture of the plasma flow inside the acceleration channel. The results confirm the existence of an anode sheath with reverse ion flow, an ionization and acceleration region separated by a sonic transition point, and the ion flux distribution hitting the walls. Furthermore, the code is able to reproduce the observed two populations of electrons and to calculate the ion distribution on the exit plane used as input data for plume simulations.},

 abstract = {Electron transport is a key process in the physics of Hall thruster discharges. Therefore, a kinetic description of the heavy particles (Xe) as well as electrons is required. The ideal numerical model would be a particle model for all the species. Nowadays, such a model is unpractical because it would need too large an amount of computation time due to the very different time scales of electrons and heavy particles dynamics. For this purpose two scalings to speed-up the execution time of a two-dimensional fully kinetic Particle-in-Cell/Monte Carlo Collision simulation of the Hall thruster SPT-100 are proposed. These two different scaling schemes generate self-similar systems of the acceleration channel including the process of secondary electron emission from the dielectric walls. Instead of using the common approach of a smaller neutral and ion mass or a larger vacuum permittivity the channel dimensions are reduced keeping the main dimensionless physics parameters constant. This leads to scaling laws for the input (magnetic field, mass flow rate, current and voltage discharge, etc.) and output parameters obeying self-similarity. This scaling methodology makes the simulation faster and allows improved modeling of electron interactions and fundamental processes. This model has demonstrated its outstanding capability in improving the physics insight into the processes in SPT-100 under the scaling constraints for the geometrical reduction. The application to particle models of different plasma based devices is suggested for such systems where a linearization of the Boltzmann equation is possible.},

Different axial regions (anode, ionization, and acceleration zones) of the channel have been investigated using the local field approximation and distinguishing between inner and outer walls. The presheath and sheath structures are different in the three regions simulated showing a charge saturated regime in the acceleration region. Small differences in behavior for the external and internal walls of the channel are detected. Further, trapped ions are found near the walls in the acceleration region which could have an important effect on the wall recombination enhancing the axial electron current.

Since previous models did not include both features it has not been possible until now to realize both effects in a single simulation. We apply an updated version of the 1D Bari model which includes a 1.5D (1Dr2Dv) Particle in Cell/Monte Carlo (PIC/MC) multispecies module coupled to the space and time dependent master equation for H2(X1Σg+,v=0,…,14) vibrational level population.

Results for hydrogen plasmas in local thermodynamic equilibrium show that the use of Debye–Hückel energy levels increases the frozen specific heat of the mixture up to 40% as compared with the corresponding quantities obtained by using Coulomb energy levels, having an opposite effect on the reactive specific heat. The total specific heat of the plasma (the sum of frozen and reactive contributions) is less affected due to compensation effects.

 abstract = {The production, destruction, and transport of H− in the extraction region of a negative ion source are investigated with a 1D(z)-3V particle-in-cell electrostatic code. The motion of charged particles (e, H+, H2+, and H−) in their self-consistent electric field is coupled with the neutral particles [H(n=1) and H2(X1∑g+,v=0,…,14)] dynamics and vibrational kinetics of H2. Neutral influxes into the domain are determined by the simulation of the expansion region. Surface and volumetric processes involving plasma and neutrals have been included by using different Monte Carlo collision methods. Calculations show the influence of the plasma grid bias and of the magnetic filter on the plasma parameter profiles. In particular, a transition from classical to complete reverse sheath is observed using a positively biased plasma grid. The influence of the magnetic filter is small. The importance of the hot-atom mechanism on the surface negative ion production is shown.},

 abstract = {A one-dimensional model of an electric-discharge XeCl laser was used in an investigation of the growth of microinstabilities induced by perturbations both of the initial electron density and of the electric field under homogeneous field and inhomogeneous preionisation conditions. A mechanism of attachment—vibrational stabilisation of a discharge in mixtures containing HCl molecules was proposed and investigated. It was found that dissociative attachment to vibrationally excited HCl molecules delays considerably the growth of microinstabilities and contraction in a selfsustained discharge. This accounts for the well-known experimental observation that a discharge in a mixture containing HCl is more stable than a discharge in a mixture containing F2. A full description of this effect could be given in the one-dimensional approximation only when one effective level was replaced by four vibrational levels (υ = 0–3). A study was made of the influence of microinstabilities on the energy characteristics of the laser. Critical perturbations of the electric field, which suppressed lasing, amounted to ~0.15% and ~1% for the KrF and XeCl laser models. These values were nearly two orders of magnitude less than the critical microperturbations of the electron density (~5% and ~100%, respectively). In the case of mixtures containing HCl there were ranges of perturbations of the initial electron density and of the electric field (up to 20% and 0.2%, respectively) in which the discharge was stable. However, there were in practice no such ranges for mixtures containing F2. The experimental results obtained for a 10-litre XeCl laser were explained when the influence of microinstabilities and contraction of the discharge current on the operational characteristics of the laser was taken into account.},

For residence times greater than 10-2 s the N2(X, nu ) and the EDF tails are strongly overpopulated. The vibrational population of the excited states N2(C3 Pi u, nu ') and N2+(B2 Sigma u+, nu ') have been experimentally determined by measuring the second positive and first negative band intensities.

The simplified time-dependent global model takes into account dissociation and ionization as well as the reverse of these processes. It also takes into account the excitation/de-excitation of an electronic excited state at 10.5 eV. The model has been applied to describe the discharge and post-discharge conditions typically met in an atmospheric-pressure dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) and in a moderate-pressure microwave discharge. The reported results show the strong coupling between the excited state and the electron energy distribution kinetics due to superelastic (vibrational and electronic) collisions. Moreover, the dissociation rate from a pure vibrational mechanism can become competitive with the corresponding rate from the direct electron impact mechanism at high values of vibrational temperature.},

 abstract = {The modeling of atmospheric gas, interacting with the space vehicles in re-entry conditions in planetary exploration missions, requires a large set of scattering data for all those elementary processes occurring in the system. A fundamental aspect of re-entry problems is represented by the strong non-equilibrium conditions met in the atmospheric plasma close to the surface of the thermal shield, where numerous interconnected relaxation processes determine the evolution of the gaseous system towards equilibrium conditions. A central role is played by the vibrational exchanges of energy, so that collisional processes involving vibrationally excited molecules assume a particular importance. In the present paper, theoretical calculations of complete sets of vibrationally state-resolved cross sections and rate coefficients are reviewed, focusing on the relevant classes of collisional processes: resonant and non-resonant electron-impact excitation of molecules, atom–diatom and molecule–molecule collisions as well as gas-surface interaction. In particular, collisional processes involving atomic and molecular species, relevant to Earth (N2, O2, NO), Mars (CO2, CO, N2) and Jupiter (H2, He) atmospheres are considered.},

Tests are carried out at heating chamber stagnation pressures of 0.65, 0.85, and 1 bar and magnetic fields of 0.15-0.35 T. The experimental observations are done by means of a set of electrical probes, an optical multichannel analyzer, and a fast shutter charge-coupled device camera. In order to maximize the effect of MHD interaction, the Faraday field is shorted, and a magnetic field perpendicular to the test body surface is used. An increase of the distance between the shock front and the body, owing to the MHD interaction, is observed. The MHD interaction effect is reduced by the low conductivity of the plasma in the boundary layer at the test body surface.},

The population densities of the vibrational levels have been obtained both by assuming a Boltz-mann population at a vibrational temperature different from the translational one and by solving a system of vibrational master equations coupled to the Boltzmann equation.  The results, which have been compared with those corresponding to a vibrationally cold molecular gas, show that the inclusion of superelastic collisions and of the parent atoms affects the EDF tails without strongly modifying the EDF bulk. As a consequence the quantities affected by the EDF bulk, such as average and characteristic energies, drift velocity, 0-1 vibrational excitation rate are not too much affected by the inclusion of superelastic vibrational collisions and of parent atoms, while a strong influence is observed on the dissociation and ionization rate coefficients which depend on the EDF tail. Calculated dissociation rates, obtained by EDF's which take into account both the presence of vibrationally excited molecules and hydrogen atoms, are in satisfactory agreement with experimental results.},

 abstract = {A self-consistent time dependent model, based on the coupling between the Boltzmann equation for free electrons, the non equilibrium vibrational kinetics for the asymmetric mode of CO2 and simplified global models for the dissociation and ionization plasma chemistry, has been applied to conditions which can be met under pulsed microwave (MW), dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) and nanosecond pulsed discharges (NPD). Under MW discharge type conditions, the selected pulse duration generates large concentration of vibrational excited states, which affects the electron energy distribution function (eedf) through the superelastic vibrational collisions. Moreover, in discharge conditions, plateaux appear in the vibrational distribution function (vdf) through the vibrational–vibrational up pumping mechanism, persisting also in the post discharge. In post discharge conditions, also the eedf is characterized by plateaux due to the superelastic collisions between cold electrons and the CO2 electronic state at 10.5 eV. The plateau in vdf increases the dissociation of pure vibrational mechanism (PVM), which can become competitive with the dissociation mechanism induced by electron molecule collisions. The PVM rates increase with the decrease of gas temperature, generating a non-Arrhenius behaviour. The situation completely changes under DBD and NPD type conditions characterized by shorter pulse duration and higher applied E/N values. Under discharge conditions, both vdf and eedf plateaux disappear, reappering in the afterglow.},

Recombination probabilities of H atoms on tungsten and graphite, relevant for the determination of the nascent vibrational distribution, are also presented. An example of a state-to-state plasma kinetic model for the description of shock waves operating in H 2 and He-H 2 mixtures is presented, emphasizing also the role of electronically-excited states in affecting the electron energy distribution function of free electrons. Finally, the thermodynamic properties and the electrical conductivity of non-ideal, high-density hydrogen plasma are finally discussed, in particular focusing on the pressure ionization phenomenon in high-pressure high-temperature plasmas.},

 abstract = {Non-equilibrium plasma kinetics of reacting CO for conditions typically met in microwave discharges have been developed based on the coupling of excited state kinetics and the Boltzmann equation for the electron energy distribution function (EEDF). Particular attention is given to the insertion in the vibrational kinetics of a complete set of electron molecule resonant processes linking the whole vibrational ladder of the CO molecule, as well as to the role of Boudouard reaction, i.e. the process of forming CO2 by two vibrationally excited CO molecules, in shaping the vibrational distribution of CO and promoting reaction channels assisted by vibrational excitation (pure vibrational mechanisms, PVM). PVM mechanisms can become competitive with electron impact dissociation processes (DEM) in the activation of CO. A case study reproducing the conditions of a microwave discharge has been considered following the coupled kinetics also in the post discharge conditions. Results include the evolution of EEDF in discharge and post discharge conditions highlighting the role of superelastic vibrational and electronic collisions in shaping the EEDF. Moreover, PVM rate coefficients and DEM ones are studied as a function of gas temperature, showing a non-Arrhenius behavior, i.e. the rate coefficients increase with decreasing gas temperature as a result of a vibrational–vibrational (V–V) pumping up mechanism able to form plateaux in the vibrational distribution function. The accuracy of the results is discussed in particular in connection to the present knowledge of the activation energy of the Boudouard process.},

Rate constants for the Boudouard reactions: CO + CO → CO2 + C and CO + CO → C2O + O, involving ground and vibrationally excited states for both singlet–singlet and singlet–triplet reactant CO molecules, have been obtained by using the transition-state theory on an ab initio generated potential energy surface. The dependence of the activation energies for the different processes on the vibrational energy of reactants has been estimated through a parametrization that accounts for the utilization of vibrational energy and is calculated by the forward and backward ab initio activation energies of the relevant processes at zero vibrational energy. The results and their comparison with available experimental reaction rates demonstrate the importance of vibrational excitation not only for the singlet–singlet reactions, but also for the singlet–triplet ones, which are here investigated for the first time. Finally, the implications of the present results on the kinetics of CO/CO2 cold plasmas are discussed: for their modeling the temperature dependence of the obtained rates for singlet–singlet and singlet–triplet reactants in the ground vibrational states have been represented by both Arrhenius and deformed Arrhenius equations.

The evolution of atmospheric pressure hydrogen plasma under the action of repetitively ns electrical pulse has been investigated using a 0D state-to-state kinetic model that self-consistently couples the master equation of heavy particles and the Boltzmann equation for free electrons. The kinetic model includes, together with atomic hydrogen states and the vibrational kinetics of H2 ground state, vibrational levels of singlet states, accounting for the collisional quenching, having a relevant role because of the high pressure. The mechanisms of excitations, radiative decay and collisional quenching involving the excited H2 states and the corresponding cross sections, integrated over the non-equilibrium electron energy distribution function (EEDF) to obtain kinetic rates, are discussed in the light of the kinetic simulation results, i.e. the time evolution during the pulse of the plasma composition, of the EEDF and of the vibrational distributions of ground and singlet excited states.

The calculations, which assume local thermodynamic equilibrium, are performed for different pressures (from. 001 to 1000 atm) in the temperature range from 50 to 30000 K. The results have been obtained by means of higher Chapman-Enskog approximations after an appropriate selection of the collision integrals. The calculations include viscosity, total thermal conductivity and electric conductivity. Internal partition functions tabulated by Giordano et al.

A new efficient method developed by the authors has been used to calculate the equilibrium composition of the gas. The collision integrals used in calculating the transport coefficients are significantly more accurate than values used in previous theoretical studies. In particular, accurate collision integrals, carried out by Mason (1967 and 1971), for interactions between charged species were calculated using the attractive and repulsive screened Coulomb potentials with quantum-mechanical corrections. The results are compared with experimental and theoretical values. Analytical expression for all transport coefficients and thermodynamic parameters are also reported.},

                    Nanopulse atmospheric carbon monoxide discharges and corresponding afterglows have been investigated in a wide range of applied reduced electric field (130 < E/N < 200 Td) and different pulse durations (2–50 ns). The results have been obtained by solving an appropriate Boltzmann equation for the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) coupled to the kinetics of vibrational and electronic excited states as well as to a simplified plasma chemistry for the different species formed during the activation of CO. The molar fraction of electronically excited states generated in the discharge is sufficient to create structures in the EEDF in the afterglow regime. On the other hand, only for long duration pulses (i.e. 50 ns), non-equilibrium vibrational distributions can be observed especially in the afterglow.

 abstract = {Nanosecond repetitively pulsed (NRP) atmospheric discharges in reacting CO mixtures have been investigated by considering different case studies obtained by changing the interpulse delay time (t id) in the range 1–25 μs and the gas temperature in the range 500–2000 K. Molar fractions of neutral and ionized particles, including free electrons as well as electron energy distribution (eedf) and vibrational distribution (vdf) functions, have been discussed by solving an appropriate Boltzmann equation and a sophisticated state-to-state vibrational kinetics of CO coupled with a simplified plasma-chemistry, describing the most important chemical species including electronic excited states. Large deviations of eedf from the Maxwell distributions are observed, especially at low t id values, as a result of superelastic electronic collisions (SEC) acting in post-discharge and mainly involving CO electronic excited states. Numerous peaks are observed in the eedf because the present study deals with so-called optically thick plasmas when radiative emission is totally reabsorbed. Non-equilibrium vdf are also observed, with plateaux tending to decrease with an increase in gas temperature, which weakens the V–V up pumping mechanism.},

The optically thick plasma conditions have been investigated in a companion paper (part I), while in the present paper we also show the results obtained by allowing radiative emission processes (optically thin plasma) as well as electronic excited state collisional quenching processes. Two case studies, which differ for the duration of the afterglow following each pulse (1 μs and 25 μs case studies) are discussed, and each pulse is characterized by a time-dependent electric field profile in the range 0–20 ns. The results, which depend on the number of pulses considered in the discharge and the corresponding afterglow duration, show several peaks in the eedf due to super-elastic electronic collisions. On the other hand, the quenching process of the a 3Π electronic state of CO determines the pumping of vibrational quanta in the v = 27 level, which in turn largely modifies the vibrational distribution function (vdf) of CO. As a consequence, the quenching of the a 3Π state increases the reactivity of CO through the Boudouard reaction, and under given conditions, this channel can become more important than the dissociation rates by electron impact collisions.},

@article{pub.1111982924,
 abstract = {The linking between the initial activities of the Rome–Bari group to their present activities is discussed in different fields of plasma chemical-physics. Several topics are presented including (1) plasma catalysis, (2) the interaction of alumina particles with thermal plasmas and its linking with the thermodynamics and transport properties of plasmas, and (3) non-equilibrium vibrational kinetics coupled with the Boltzmann equation for the electron energy distribution functions (eedf) in aerospace and cold plasma applications. The old activities in plasma catalysis pointed out the importance of atomic species affecting catalytic reactions opening also to the possibility of non-equilibrium vibrational distributions on the chemisorbed ad-atoms. This last aspect is discussed also taking into account recent developments. The study of the interaction of alumina particles with thermal plasmas was rationalized assuming that the step controlling the reaction could be the heat transfer plasma-particle. The model used a simplified fluid dynamic approach with the insertion of accurate values of thermodynamic and transport properties of thermal plasmas. This kind of activity can be considered precursor on the intense work in the field with particular attention on the importance of electronic excited states in affecting thermodynamics and transport of plasmas. Moreover, the plasma-particle interactions can be recovered to a given extent in the modern aspects of hypersonics in the boundary layer of re-entering vehicles as well as in the nozzle flow expansion. In both cases, we underline the existence of vibrational distributions (vdf) far from the Boltzmann behaviour and rates presenting an anti-Arrhenius trend as a function of the inverse of gas temperature. Concerning the non-equilibrium vibrational kinetics, we discuss two case studies. The first one deals with the behaviour of cold nitrogen plasmas pointing out the role of superelastic vibrational and electronic collisions on vdf and eedf. In this case, we discuss also the same case study comparing the results obtained by a complete set of electron molecule cross-sections acting on the whole vibrational ladder with the corresponding ones which consider transitions starting and arriving to the vibrational ground state of the molecule. The last case study concerns the dissociation kinetics of CO2 in cold plasmas, a topic largely studied in the past to emphasize the role of vibrational excitation in CO2 destruction. Recent results obtained using a sophisticated model based on the coupling of Boltzmann equation for the eedf and a state-to-state vibrational kinetics of the asymmetric ladder of CO2 are reported. The interplay between dissociation process by direct electron impact collision and by heavy particle collisions with vibrationally excited CO2 molecules is discussed.Graphical abstract},

Emphasis is given to the role of dissociative electron attachment (DEA) from vibrationally excited states in affecting the eedf and vdf under extreme conditions, i.e., an optically thick plasma with quenching processes involving the electronic excited states, populated by a sequence of discharge pulses and corresponding afterglows. In particular, the quenching process of the a<sup>3</sup>Π electronic state of CO determines a pumping of vibrational quanta in the ground state, which in turn largely modifies the CO vdf promoting the activation of DEA process.

 abstract = {An advanced model for the calculation of electron energy distribution functions (eedfs), vibrational distributions, and electronic excited state densities of reacting CO2 in microwave (MW) discharges has been developed for clarifying: (1) the role of electronic states of the relevant neutral species in affecting the eedf and (2) the contribution to the CO2 dissociation of the electron impact and heavy particle dissociation mechanisms. To model the discharge, the power density typical of MW discharges is used as a parameter. Different case studies including optically thick and thin plasmas and the dependence of the CO2 dissociation rates on the gas temperature are investigated. The results show that at a low gas temperature, i.e., 300 K, the heavy-particle dissociation mechanism, also called the pure vibrational mechanism, prevails on the electron impact dissociation one, while at a high gas temperature, i.e., 2000 K, the two mechanisms become competitive and the global behavior strongly depends on the choice of electron impact dissociation cross sections. Large differences appear in the eedf, especially in the post-discharge regime, when considering thick and thin plasmas. In the thick case, a well-structured eedf appears as a result of superelastic collisions mainly involving the electronic states of the relevant neutral species. In the thin plasma, many peaks disappear because the concentration of the excited states strongly decreases. Finally, our model gives the results of conversion and energy efficiency as well as vibrational distributions in satisfactory agreement with the corresponding results calculated by the Antwerp group.},

 abstract = {Numerous applications have required the study of CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ plasmas since the 1960s, from CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ lasers to spacecraft heat shields. However, in recent years, intense research activities on the subject have restarted because of environmental problems associated with CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ emissions. The present review provides a synthesis of the current state of knowledge on the physical chemistry of cold CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ plasmas. In particular, the different modeling approaches implemented to address specific aspects of CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ plasmas are presented. Throughout the paper, the importance of conducting joint experimental, theoretical and modeling studies to elucidate the complex couplings at play in CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ plasmas is emphasized. Therefore, the experimental data that are likely to bring relevant constraints to the different modeling approaches are first reviewed. Second, the calculation of some key elementary processes obtained with semi-empirical, classical and quantum methods is presented. In order to describe the electron kinetics, the latest coherent sets of cross section satisfying the constraints of “electron swarm” analyses are introduced, and the need for self-consistent calculations for determining accurate electron energy distribution function (EEDF) is evidenced. The main findings of the latest zero-dimensional (0D) global models about the complex chemistry of CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ and its dissociation products in different plasma discharges are then given, and full state-to-state (STS) models of only the vibrational-dissociation kinetics developed for studies of spacecraft shields are described. Finally, two important points for all applications using CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ containing plasma are discussed: the role of surfaces in contact with the plasma, and the need for 2D/3D models to capture the main features of complex reactor geometries including effects induced by fluid dynamics on the plasma properties. In addition to bringing together the latest advances in the description of CO2$$\hbox {CO}_2$$ non-equilibrium plasmas, the results presented here also highlight the fundamental data that are still missing and the possible routes that still need to be investigated.Graphic abstract},

 abstract = {We report results obtained by our 0D, time-dependent self-consistent model for the description of the CO2 plasma kinetics in glow discharge conditions, comparing our results with the simulation and experimental results reported by Grofulovic et al (2018 Plasma Sources Sci. Technol. 27 115009; 2019 PhD Thesis) and Klarenaar et al (2017 Plasma Sources Sci. Technol. 26 115008). Our model is based on the simultaneous solution of the kinetic equations describing the vibrational, the electronic excited states and the plasma chemistry and of the electron Boltzmann equation for the calculation of the electron energy distribution function (eedf). The results for the vibrational level densities of CO2 show a satisfactory agreement with the Grofulovic’s model results, despite the differences in the vibrational energy level scheme and in the kinetic processes included with the correspondent rate coefficients, with a good match also with the corresponding experimental results. Moreover, conditions characterized by higher power density (5–50 W cm−3) have been investigated to understand the behavior of the CO2 plasma discharge when a higher vibrational excitation is present. Large deviations of the vibrational distributions of CO2 and CO from equilibrium ones are predicted both in discharge and post discharge conditions. In particular, the CO2 vibrational distribution presents a behavior similar to a Treanor distribution for v < 15 while a deactivation of the plateau in the vibrational distribution function after v > 15 appears as a consequence of the dissociation induced by vibrational excitation mechanism, i.e. pure vibrational mechanism, becoming important at higher power densities. Finally, the results dependence on the selection of the CO2 electron molecule dissociation cross section, i.e. Phelps (1973 J. Appl. Phys. 44 4464 or Cosby (1993 Report No. AD-A266 464 WL-TR-93-2004 (Dayton, OH: Wright-Patterson Airforce Base)), has been investigated, showing that its more opportune choice is still a problem to be discussed for the description of conditions in which the electron impact dissociation dominates the kinetics, while once vibrational excitation is activated, CO2 dissociation is essentially driven by vibrational-induced dissociation, depending to a minor extent from that choice.},

 abstract = {The activation of vibrational-induced dissociation of CO2 in cold non-equilibrium plasma discharges is investigated by means of a 0D self-consistent kinetic model, which, with a state-to-state approach, is able to calculate the CO2 vibrational distribution function (vdf) of the asymmetric mode levels, the electron energy distribution function and the corresponding vibrational-induced and electron impact CO2 dissociation rates. The conditions for the onset of such activation are linked to the achievement of a sufficiently high CO2 vibrational excitation characterized by the presence of a non-equilibrium plateau in the CO2 vdf, resulting from the combined effect of electron–vibrational and vibrational–vibrational collisions, which, by overpopulating the higher vibrational levels, enhances dissociation. Such non-equilibrium conditions are maximized at lower gas temperature, lower pressure and higher power density values. In particular, for the power density, an activation threshold value can be obtained from simulations and its dependence on the gas temperature and pressure can be investigated. The dependence of the maximum vibrational temperature reached at the end of the discharge as a function of the gas temperature and pressure is also analyzed. A satisfactory agreement from our simulation results with the Kotov’s criterion for vibrational activation has been found.},

 abstract = {An advanced chemical model, based on the state-to-state approach, is applied to the modeling of a multicusp negative ion source. Simulations are performed with the GPKin kinetic code that solves the Boltzmann equation for free electrons self-consistently coupled with the Master Equations, following the evolution of the non-equilibrium electron energy distribution function (EEDF) and the vibrational kinetics of the ground and excited singlet electronic states of the H2 molecule. The virtual experiments reproduce the conditions of an experiment in the literature, showing the predictive character of the present approach and validating the model. The sensitivity of the results to the selected database of cross-sections for the electron impact-induced processes is investigated, clarifying the impact of more accurate datasets for specific processes in the mechanisms of negative ion production.},

@article{pub.1165706231,
 abstract = {This study concerns the importance of the precursor (or pre-reactive) state of elementary physicochemical processes whose basic features, as structure, stability, and trapping effect of reagents, are controlled by the balance of intermolecular forces that arise at long range and operate at intermediate and short separation distances. The detailed formulation of such forces, determining formation probability and dynamical evolution of the precursor state, is of relevance in molecular science and difficult to be treated by quantum chemistry. Such a problem has been tackled by us exploiting the phenomenological approach, which employs semi-empirical and empirical formulas to represent strength, range and angular dependence of the leading interaction components involved. In addition to the study of transport phenomena, part of the attention is addressed to chemi-ionization (or Penning ionization) reactions for which neutral reagents lead to atomic and/or molecular ions plus electrons as products. Chemi-ionizations are bimolecular processes occurring in several environments of interest, where a reagent is a species, formed in excited-metastable electronic states by collisions with energetic electrons or cosmic rays. For such reactions all crucial electronic rearrangements, affecting stability and evolution of the weakly bound precursor state, here coincident with the reaction transition state, are characterized with a high detail. The results of the present study are of interest for many other processes, whose precursor states and their relevant features are difficult to characterize, often masked by several other effects.Graphical abstract},

 abstract = {The paper collects and discusses the results obtained in the theoretical investigation of cold plasmas by using a state-to-state self-consistent kinetic approach, coupling chemistry and free electron kinetics. Examples are selected, not only to review the most recent advancements made in updating and extending the chemical model, but also to highlight the role played in all these systems by excited states, either vibrational or electronic, in affecting the plasma evolution in the discharge and in the post-discharge phases in different discharge configurations. The response of the kinetic simulation to the accuracy of the dynamical data describing the collisional processes, to the theoretical scheme adopted for the vibrational levels of molecules, and to the inclusion of the relevant dissociation channels, is discussed also in the light of the comparison with experiments for model validation.},
