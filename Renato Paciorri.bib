 abstract = {Within a continuum framework, flows featuring shock waves can be modelled by means of either shock capturing or shock fitting. Shock-capturing codes are algorithmically simple, but are plagued by a number of numerical troubles, particularly evident when shocks are strong and the grids unstructured. On the other hand, shock-fitting algorithms on structured grids allow to accurately compute solutions on coarse meshes, but tend to be algorithmically complex. We show how recent advances in computational mesh generation allow to relieve some of the difficulties encountered by shock capturing and contribute towards making shock fitting on unstructured meshes a versatile technique.},

 abstract = {A novel unstructured shock-fitting algorithm for three-dimensional flows is proposed in this paper. This new technique is able to work coupled with any unstructured vertex centred solver. The fitted shock front is described using a triangulated surface that is allowed to move, while obeying to the Rankine–Hugoniot jump relations, throughout a background tetrahedral mesh which covers the entire computational domain. At each time step, a local, constrained Delaunay tetrahedralization is applied in the neighbourhood of the shock front to ensure that the triangles, which make up the shock surface, belong to the overall tetrahedral grid. The fitted shock front acts as an interior boundary for the unstructured shock-capturing solver, used to solve the discretised governing equations in the smooth regions of the flow-field. The present algorithm has been tested against high speed flows past three-dimensional bodies, providing high quality results even using coarse grain tetrahedralization.},

In the present paper, both global and local a posteriori grid-convergence analysis is used to quantitatively measure the discretization error and order of convergence of the numerical solutions obtained using this new unstructured shock-fitting technique. Specifically, the analysis has considered the numerical solutions of two different flows characterized by the presence of strong shocks: a transonic source flow and an hypersonic flow past a circular cylinder. It is shown that the shock-fitting technique allows to compute numerical solutions that converge, both pointwise and in a global sense, with an observed order of accuracy that is very close to the design order of the spatial discretization scheme and with very small discretization errors.},

The discussion about the von Neumann paradox and the Guderley’s triple shock wave solution are an example of this interest. In the present paper the attention is focused on those steady state reflections where the Von Neumann theory fails or does not provide the “classical” solution with incident and reflected shocks belonging to opposite families. Contrarily to the theory, numerical solutions of these problems show a Mach reflection similar to von Neumann triple point solution, provided that the computed shocks have a physical or numerical thickness. These special cases of Mach reflections are discussed with the help of numerical solutions obtained by different approaches based on shock capturing and shock fitting, respectively.},

 abstract = {Experimental wind tunnel tests, conducted to reproduce the base flow past a space launcher during early ascent fight conditions, were numerically simulated by solving the steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations using two different versions of the Spalart–Allmaras model. The launcher model consisted of a cylinder with a circular cross section, an ogival nose, and a centered nozzle that issued a supersonic cold jet embedded in the external subsonic stream. A comparative analysis of the data obtained from the steady-state simulations and from the experimental tests indicated that the launcher base pressure was closely related to the turbulent shear stresses within the jet mixing layer; therefore, accurate modeling of the compressibility effects in the turbulent mixing layer plays an important role in improving the base drag estimates provided by the numerical simulations.},

 abstract = {Abstract. The paper investigates the influence of the thermochemical modeling on the flow-field properties for both compressing and expanding flows. For the nitrogen hypersonic flow over a cylinder a comparison between a model neglecting vibrational energy and two-temperature Park's nonequilibrium model has been performed in a wide variety of experimental and free flight conditions. It is shown that the differences are confined in a thin layer behind the bow shock while the overall flow properties are slightly affected. For the expanding air flows inside hypersonic facilities, besides the two models mentioned above, vibrational equilibrium and CVDV model have been compared. It was found that vibrational nonequilibrium can not be disregarded but no discernible differences have been observed between Park's and CVDV model results, unless the enthalpy is very large.Sommario. L'articolo analizza l'influenza della modellizzazione termochimica sul campo fluidodinamico nel caso di flussi ipersonici sia in compressione che in espansione. Per il flusso di azoto attorno ad un cilindro è stato effettuato un confronto fra un modello che trascura l'energia vibrazionale ed il modello di non-equilibrio a due temperature di Park. L'analisi è stata condotta per un ampio intervallo di variazione dei parametri caratteristici comprendente condizioni sia di volo che di prove in laboratorio. Il confronto ha mostrato che l'effetto del non-equilibrio vibrazionale è sempre limitato ad una regione molto sottile dietro l'onda d'urto e che l'influenza sulle proprietà generali del flusso è in ogni caso modesta. Per il caso dei flussi in espansione in gallerie ipersoniche si è invece assunto come gas l'aria ed oltre ai due modelli già menzionati sono stati utilizzati anche il modello di equilibrio vibrazionale ed il modello CVDV. Si è osservato che per i flussi in espansione il non-equilibrio vibrazionale non può essere trascurato ma che comunque i modelli di Park e CVDV sono sostanzialmente equivalenti tranne nei casi di valori molto elevati dell'entalpia totale.},

The present work investigates the three-dimensional flow field generated on this kind of nozzle by partitioning the primary nozzle into modules. A linear plug nozzle has been designed together with modules having two different geometries: a rectangular cross section and round-to-square module. Numerical simulations have been carried out considering the case where all modules of the primary nozzle are active and the case where one module is turned off. The solutions are compared and specific three-dimensional flow structures taking place inside the modules and on the plug are identified. The relationship between these structures and the skin friction distribution within the module and along the plug surface is investigated. Finally, the effect on performance of these three-dimensional flow features is emphasized.},

@article{pub.1062076961,
 abstract = {In linear cascade wind tunnel tests, a high level of pitchwise periodicity is desirable to reproduce the azimuthal periodicity in the stage of an axial compressor or turbine. Transonic tests in a cascade wind tunnel with open jet boundaries have been shown to suffer from spurious waves, reflected at the jet boundary, that compromise the flow periodicity in pitch. This problem can be tackled by placing at this boundary a slotted tailboard with a specific wall void ratio s and pitch angle α. The optimal value of the s-α pair depends on the test section geometry and on the tunnel running conditions. An inviscid two-dimensional numerical method has been developed to predict transonic linear cascade flows, with and without a tailboard, and quantify the nonperiodicity in the discharge. This method includes a new computational boundary condition to model the effects of the tailboard slots on the cascade interior flow. This method has been applied to a six-blade turbine nozzle cascade, transonically tested at the University of Leicester. The numerical results identified a specific slotted tailboard geometry, able to minimize the spurious reflected waves and regain some pitchwise flow periodicity. The wind tunnel open jet test section was redesigned accordingly. Pressure measurements at the cascade outlet and synchronous spark schlieren visualization of the test section, with and without the optimized slotted tailboard, have confirmed the gain in pitchwise periodicity predicted by the numerical model.},

 abstract = {Even though shock-capturing techniques are the de-facto standard in the CFD simulation of turbo-machinery flows, the accurate estimation of shock-induced losses in transonic flows can be severely hindered by the numerical errors that are generated along a captured shock and convected downstream. Indeed, and despite their widespread use, shock-capturing techniques are known to be plagued by a number of drawbacks that are inherent to the numerical details of the shock-capturing process.In recent works, the authors have developed a novel shock fitting technique for unstructured grids that has been applied to the computation of transonic, supersonic and hypersonic flows in both two and three space dimensions. In this paper, the proposed technique is applied to two-dimensional, transonic flows around an isolated profile and in a gas turbine cascade.It is shown that the use of unstructured meshes allows to relieve most of the algorithmic difficulties that have contributed to the dismissal of the shock-fitting technique in the framework of structured meshes. Moreover, it is confirmed that, in contrast to shock-capturing, shock-fitting allows to obtain very accurate solution on coarse meshes.},

 abstract = {In this paper, a new shock-fitting technique based on unstructured dynamic grids is proposed to improve the performances of the unstructured “boundary” shock-fitting technique developed by Liu and co-workers in [1, 2]. The main feature of this new technique, which we call the “embedded” shock-fitting technique, is its capability to insert or remove shocks or parts thereof during the calculation. This capability is enabled by defining subsets of grid-points (mutually connected by lines) which behave as either “common”- or “shock”-points, shock-waves being made of an ordered collection of shock-points. Two different sets of flow variables, corresponding to the upstream and downstream sides of the shocks, are assigned to the shock-points, which may be switched to common- and back to shock-points, a feature that allows to vary the length of the existing shocks and/or make new shock-branches appear. This paper illustrates the algorithmic features of this new technique and presents the results obtained when simulating both steady and un-steady, two-dimensional flows.},

In the proposed work, the authors present a new shock fitting technique for structured solvers able to overcome the limitations that affected the approaches originally developed, such as the boundary shock-fitting and the floating shock fitting. Specifically, the technique presented herein removes the strong link between grid topology and shock position, which characterizes boundary shock-fitting methods, and reduces significantly the expensive coding effort for implementing floating shock-fitting methods. In particular, three different test-case, which also deal with mutually interacting discontinuities, are deeply discussed and analyzed. Finally, a global grid-convergence analysis has been performed to quantitatively measure discretization errors and order-of-convergence of the proposed numerical approach.},

@article{pub.1145202695,
 abstract = {A new shock-tracking technique that avoids re-meshing the computational grid around the moving shock-front was recently proposed by the authors (Ciallella et al., 2020). The method combines the unstructured shock-fitting (Paciorri and Bonfiglioli, 2009) approach, developed in the last decade by some of the authors, with ideas coming from embedded boundary methods. In particular, second-order extrapolations based on Taylor series expansions are employed to transfer the solution and retain high order of accuracy. This paper describes the basic idea behind the new method and further algorithmic improvements which make the extrapolated Discontinuity Tracking Technique ( e D I T ) capable of dealing with complex shock-topologies featuring shock–shock and shock–wall interactions occurring in steady problems. This method paves the way to a new class of shock-tracking techniques truly independent on the mesh structure and flow solver. Various test-cases are included to prove the potential of the method, demonstrate the key features of the methodology, and thoroughly evaluate several technical aspects related to the extrapolation from/onto the shock, and their impact on accuracy, and conservation.},

 abstract = {View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-3989.vid The numerical simulation of hypersonic flows past blunt bodies by means of shock-capturing solvers is characterized by some critical drawbacks which worsen the solution quality, including stagnation point anomalies, spurious numerical oscillations, the carbuncle phenomenon, and the reduction of the order of accuracy of the solution in the entire region downstream of a captured shock. This paper describes an updated version of an unstructured shock-fitting algorithm for three-dimensional flows based on the GRUMMP (Generation and Refinement of Unstructured, Mixed-element Mesh in Parallel) library and the shock surface extraction and reconstruction process from a shock-capturing solution. The proposed technique is applied to a high speed laminar flow past a sphere, which has been extensively studied in the literature. In particular, the comparison between the shock-fitting and shock-capturing approaches clearly highlights the advantages of shock fitting, since it is able to improve the solution quality in the entire shock layer and over the body surface.},

 abstract = {View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-3990.vid The confluence of three shock waves at a common branching point is observed in different shock-interaction patterns, the most prominent example being the irregular reflection of an oblique shock from a solid surface, known as a Mach reflection. During WWII, John von Neumann developed an analytical model of the Mach reflection which fits well the experiments, except when the incident shock is weak. This inconsistency is referred to in the literature as the von Neumann paradox. In this paper we combine numerical simulations performed using a shock-fitting CFD code and shock polar analysis to show that the triple-point that arises in the so-called fishtail shock-structure, which is observed in the transonic flow past airfoils, is not amenable to be described using von Neumann’s model. Our analysis points to the fact that Guderley’s four waves model, which has already been experimentally and numerically validated as a plausible solution to the von Neumann paradox, should be used instead.},

 abstract = {Slender profiles flying at nearly sonic speed exhibit a peculiar shock pattern, which is commonly referred to in literature as the “fishtail” shock structure. It consists of two oblique shock waves that originate at the trailing edge of the airfoil and interact with a detached, nearly normal shock wave in two triple points located along the oblique shocks. Making use of both shock-fitting and shock-capturing CFD simulations and classical shock polar analysis, we prove that, in the case of a NACA0012 airfoil, the two interaction points cannot be modeled using the three shocks theory that von Neumann developed nearly a century ago to describe triple points arising in Mach reflections. Our analysis suggests that the four-wave interaction model proposed by Guderley should be used instead.},

 abstract = {The need to meet the demands of the aerospace market in terms of payload capability, mission flexibility, and cost reduction has led the European Space Agency to develop Vega-C as an evolution of the original Vega launcher. The design of a modern launch vehicle like the Vega-C requires accurate evaluation of the thermal and mechanical loads on its surface under conditions as close as possible to real flight conditions. Despite its apparently simple aeroshape, the Vega-C surface is characterized by the presence of antennas, wiring ducts, flanges, and retrorockets. These protuberances interact with the external supersonic stream during the launcher’s flight, giving rise to locally complex flows that can impose stresses on the launcher structure through the generation of severe mechanical and thermal loads. The present work focuses on an in-depth aerothermal analysis of Vega-C protuberances under specific flight conditions. Numerical computations are carried out using the commercial solver [Formula: see text] on multiblock structured Chimera grids to assess which protuberances are subject to the most severe surface loads. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of boundary-layer thickness in the heat flux and pressure peaks that occur on the protuberances.},
